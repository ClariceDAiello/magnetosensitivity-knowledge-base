## Abstract

With the development and growing popularity of modern appliances, including
MRI in the hospitals, the potential impact of magnetic fields on human health is
invoking increasing concerns. At the same time, static magnetic field (SMF) has
been used in the clinical treatment of tumors and other diseases since decades ago.
However, there are still some reservations and uncertainties about the exact effects
of magnetic fields on human bodies, which are largely due to the differential bio-
logical effects reported in the literature. These experimental inconsistencies are
mainly caused by variations such as different magnetic field types, intensities, treat-
ment time, as well as biological samples examined. The purpose of this book is to
review scientific evidences and summarize the emerging topic about the effects of
SMF on biological samples ranging from single molecules, subcellular compart-
ments, and cells to whole organisms, as well as the potential application of SMF in
clinical treat
