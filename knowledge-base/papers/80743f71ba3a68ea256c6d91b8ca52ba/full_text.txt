Preface
With the development of modern technology, people are exposed to increased mag-
netic fields. Here we specifically focus on static magnetic field (SMF), which means
the magnetic field strength does not change over time. SMF is different than the
dynamic or time-varying magnetic field. For example, cellular phones or micro-
waves are pulsed magnetic fields with different frequencies, which belong to
dynamic magnetic fields and will not be discussed in this book. Most commonly
seen SMFs are the household magnets, the core component in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) machines in hospitals, magnetic elevation trains, as well as the weak
but widely existed earth magnetic fields. They are all SMFs, with different intensi-
ties. The magnetic field intensities people are exposed to vary from 0.05 mT (earth
magnetic fields) to almost 10 T (high-field MRI in preclinical research).
To set up a safety standard for human exposure to SMFs, there are many related
researches studying the effects of the magnetic fields at molecular, cellular, animal,
as well as human body levels. Accordingly, WHO (World Health Organization) and
ICNIRP (International Commission on Non-ionizing Radiation Protection) have
published some guidelines for the SMF exposure of human bodies to ensure that
people are not overexposed. At the same time, magnetic therapy, which was never
in the mainstream medicine, has wide applications by many people as alternative or
supplementary treatments. Most of them are currently used in pain relief, as well as
some other nonurgent applications. However, the magnetic therapies in general are
not substantiated by enough sound scientific proofs. Only with proper and detailed
knowledge, people could try to maximize the proper usage of SMFs in our daily
lives without hurting our bodies. We need to undertake serious and practical research
into the magnetic effects on the biological systems so that we will have practical
knowledge, both medically and scientifically.
It should be mentioned that we will not cover magnetic nanoparticle studies,
which have a fast growing trend and have promising therapeutic applications for
future medical treatments; we will focus on the externally applied magnetic fields
on human and animal objects, but not the magnetic fields produced within living

organisms (biomagnetism). We try to cover most aspects of biological effects of
SMFs on human cells but also want to apologize for any missed research findings
that are not included in this book. Our goal is try to provide people with an overview
of the current understanding of the biological effects of SMFs and hope to encour-
age more scientists to get involved in this field so that we can get a clearer view of
this field in the near future.

Abstract
With the development and growing popularity of modern appliances, including
MRI in the hospitals, the potential impact of magnetic fields on human health is
invoking increasing concerns. At the same time, static magnetic field (SMF) has
been used in the clinical treatment of tumors and other diseases since decades ago.
However, there are still some reservations and uncertainties about the exact effects
of magnetic fields on human bodies, which are largely due to the differential bio-
logical effects reported in the literature. These experimental inconsistencies are
mainly caused by variations such as different magnetic field types, intensities, treat-
ment time, as well as biological samples examined. The purpose of this book is to
review scientific evidences and summarize the emerging topic about the effects of
SMF on biological samples ranging from single molecules, subcellular compart-
ments, and cells to whole organisms, as well as the potential application of SMF in
clinical treatment of cancer and other diseases. It will help clarify some dilemmas
in this field and encourage further investigation in order to achieve a better under-
standing of the biological effects of SMF, aiming for a rational application of SMF
in clinical diagnosis and therapy in the near future.

Chapter 1
Parameters of Magnetic Fields and Their
Differential Biological Effects
Abstract This chapter summarizes different parameters of the magnetic fields,
including magnetic field types, intensity, homogeneousness, field direction and
exposure time. Various factors that contribute to the differential effects of magnetic
fields on biological samples, which lead to the seemingly lack of consistencies in
literature will be discussed.
Keywords Static magnetic fields (SMF) • Pulsed magnetic field (PMF) • Magnetic
field intensity • Gradient magnetic fields • Differential effects of magnetic fields
1.1 Introduction
The biological effects of magnetic fields can be directly influenced by different
parameters. Depending on whether the magnetic intensity changes over time, mag-
netic fields can be divided into static magnetic field (SMF) or dynamic/time-varying
magnetic field, which can be further divided into different categories according to
their frequency. Depending on the magnetic field intensity, there are weak, moder-
ate, strong (high) and ultra-strong (ultra-high) magnetic fields. Depending on the
magnetic field spatial distribution, there are homogeneous or inhomogeneous mag-
netic fields. Here we will discuss the major variations in magnetic field parameters
and their differential effects on biological objects.
1.1.1 Static Magnetic Field vs. Dynamic Magnetic Field
When the magnetic field intensity does not change over time, it is called “static
magnetic field”. In contrast, if the magnetic field strength changes over time, it is
called “dynamic magnetic field” or “time-varying magnetic field”. Pulsed magnetic
fields (PMFs) are the most commonly seen dynamic magnetic fields, such as the
50 Hz or 60 Hz power frequency alternating current (AC) magnetic fields and radio-
frequency magnetic fields. Over the past few decades, there are emerging concerns
about the growing exposure to these electromagnetic fields, which also encouraged

4 1 Parameters of Magnetic Fields and Their Differential Biological Effects
Fig. 1.1 The international EMF (electromagnetic fields) project. The international EMF project is
to assess health and environmental effects of human body exposure to static and time-varying
electric and magnetic fields. It includes the most commonly seen electromagnetic exposure (Figure
and information were from the WHO website http://www.who.int/entity/peh-emf/project/en/)
a huge amount of epidemiological and laboratory studies. Accordingly, WHO
(World Health Organization) has initiated the International EMF (electromagnetic
fields) project to assess health and environmental effects of exposure to static and
time-varying electric and magnetic fields in the frequency range 0–300 GHz
(Fig. 1.1).
From the current research, it is obvious that cells respond very differently to
magnetic fields with different types and intensities. For example, a 50-Hz, 1 mT
PMF could increase rat pituitary GH3 cell proliferation (Grassi et al. 2004) but a 0.5
T static magnetic field obviously inhibited GH3 cell proliferation (Rosen and
Chastney 2009). In addition, multiple evidences showed that different types of mag-
netic fields of the same magnetic field intensity could produce totally different
effects on the same sample examined. For example, a 0.4 mT 50 Hz and a 2 μT
1.8 GHz PMFs both increased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphor-
ylation, which were reversed by incoherent (“noise”) magnetic fields of the same
intensities (Wang et al. 2010; Li et al. 2012). Although the mechanism of how the
incoherent magnetic field reversed the effect of PMF is still unknown, it is clear that
the magnetic type can directly affect the field effects.
Since PMFs have variable parameters, such as field intensity and frequency, it is
relatively difficult to study the biological mechanisms of magnetic effects compre-
hensively and systematically. For example, it was shown that PMFs with different
frequencies can have diverse effects on cell proliferation. In comparison to the

--- Page 15 ---

1.1 I ntroduction 5
time- varying/dynamic magnetic fields, SMFs are more suitable to study the funda-
mental biological mechanisms because they have less changeable parameters. The
most commonly exposed SMFs are the permanent magnets, such as the magnets on
household refrigerators, toys and accessories, which are usually not very strong
(below 1 T). In addition, the core component of the MRI (Magnetic Resonance
Imaging) machine in the hospital is a strong magnet, which generates a SMF with
field intensities usually range between 0.5–3 T in most hospitals nowadays.
SMFs usually generate much milder effects on human beings compared to time-
varying magnetic fields and many of the effects are actually beneficial. Therefore
we are much more interested in SMFs, and this book will only focus on discussing
the biological effects of SMFs. For people who are interested in dynamic electro-
magnetic fields from power lines, microwave ovens and cell phones, there are many
other resources, including some books, such as Biological effects of magnetic and
electromagnetic fields by Shoogo Ueno (1996), Biomagnetics: Principles and
Applications of Biomagnetic Stimulation and Imaging by Shoogo Ueno and Masaki
Sekino (2015), Electromagnetic Fields in Biology and Medicine by Marko
S. Markov (2015) as well as some other reviews (Simko and Mattsson 2004; Funk
et al. 2009). In addition to the published books and ICNIRP (International commis-
sion on non-ionizing radiation protection) guidance in 2014, recent works in 2016
also show that there are no detrimental effects of radiofrequency PMFs on research
animal models at the levels that people are exposed to (Gao et al. 2016; McNamee
et al. 2016). Overall, as far as we know, there is still not enough evidence to show
that the dynamic magnetic fields that many people are concerned have definite
adverse impacts on human health. However, more careful and long-term investiga-
tions in both epidemiology and laboratory research are certainly needed to draw an
unambiguous conclusion.
1.1.2 Different Magnetic Field Intensities: Weak, Moderate,
High and Ultra-high Magnetic Field
According to their magnetic flux intensity, SMFs used in the biological effect stud-
ies could be classified as weak (<1 mT), moderate (1 mT to 1 T), high (1–20 T) and
ultra-high (20 T and above).
1T (Tesla)=10,000 G (Gauss)
1G=100µT
It should be mentioned that the classification of magnetic fields varies between
different research areas. Therefore people should always clearly label the magnetic
field intensity that they use. Despite the classification, with the development of
modern technology, people nowadays have much increased exposure to various
SMFs. Figure 1.2 shows some examples of different SMF intensities, including the

ubiquitous earth magnetic field of weak intensity, permanent magnets of various
intensities (usually moderate intensity), MRI machines in hospitals and research
institutes with high SMFs, as well as ultra-high magnets currently mainly used for
research purposes (Fig. 1.2). It should be mentioned that the use of high and ultra-
high magnetic fields is expanding quickly in recent years, which is no longer limited
to the conventional investigation of condensed matter physics and material science,
but expanded to diamagnetic materials, such as the majority components of our
human bodies.
Because of the public sensitivity, the question of the possible effects of SMFs of
0.5–7 T, the range of the MRI machines in current hospitals as well as in preclinical
researches (Fig. 1.2d), on human health is of paramount interest. The MRI process
involves a combination of non-ionizing SMFs, gradient magnetic fields and pulsed
radiofrequency fields. Currently the MRI scanners are considered to be safe and
studies show that 7 T high field MRI is well tolerated by humans without excessive
discomfort (Miyakoshi 2006; Simko 2007; Heilmaier et al. 2011), DNA damage
(Fatahi et al. 2016) or other cellular abnormalities (Sakurai et al. 1999). At the same
time, since stronger magnets could give better resolution and more detection pos-
sibilities, the researchers and engineers are currently investigating on building MRI
machines with stronger magnetic fields. In fact, there are currently 9.4 T MRI
machines (Fig. 1.2e) not only used on animal studies in research but also on healthy
human volunteers at preclinical stage (Adair 2000; Miyakoshi 2005; Zhang et al.
2015). Moreover, 21.1 T MRI has already been developed and applied on samples
such as mouse brain (Schweitzer et al. 2010; Schepkin et al. 2014; Nagel et al.
2016) (see Chap 2, Fig. 2.3).
Although FDA increases the limit of SMF field intensity with no significant risk
to 8 T, whether longer time exposure to SMFs of this intensity is safe on human
body is still not clear. In addition, whether higher fields above 8 T are safe on human
is unclear either. There will be increasing safety concerns along with the develop-
ment of ultra-high MRI machines. So far there are very limited studies that have
investigated on high SMFs around 9 T on animal and human cells. In 2011, Zhao
et al. studied human-hamster hybrid (AL) cells and found that 8.5 T SMF decreased
cellular ATP level and increased ROS level (Zhao et al. 2011). Nakahara et al. found
that 10 T SMF alone did not affect CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells for the cell
cycle distribution or proliferation unless they were combined with X-ray treatment
(Nakahara et al. 2002). Recently, we found that although 9 T SMF did not affect
CHO cells, they could inhibit some human cancer cell growth, such as colon cancer
HCT116 cells and nasopharyngeal cancer CNE-2Z cells (Zhang et al. 2016b). In
addition, human glioblastoma A172 cells embedded in collagen gels, but not A172
cells alone, oriented perpendicular to the field direction of 10 T SMF (Hirose et al.
2003), which is largely due to the diamagnetic anisotropy of collagen fibers. Zhao
et al. investigated the effects of 13 T SMF on immortalized hamster cells and human
primary fibroblasts cells and found that both cell cycle and cell viability were not
affected (Zhao et al. 2010). A high SMF of 14 T affected the morphology of
smooth muscle cell assemblies, as well as cell colony shapes, which extended along
the direction of the magnetic field (Iwasaka et al. 2003). Moreover, Rat2 rat

Fig. 1.3 Ultra-high magnetic field biological study platform in Chinese High Magnetic Field
Laboratory (CHMFL). The biological study platform with 18 mm culture plates is suitable to study
various cell cultures, including human and animal cells, eukaryotes and prokaryotes, as well as
small animal models, such as fruit flies, C elegans and zebra fish
fibroblast cells, NIH-3T3 mouse cells, HeLa human cervical cancer cells and murine
hippocampal cells were exposed to 7–17 T ultra-high SMFs, which affected Rat2,
NIH-3T3 and HeLa cell attachment and neuron cell differentiation. Immunostaining
analysis revealed that the actin cytoskeleton was affected by ultra-high SMFs
(Valiron et al. 2005). A great deal of researches must be conducted to demonstrate
the safety of ultra-high MRI before it can be fully applied on human bodies.
Due to technical limitations, the biological effects of strong field of ≥20 T on
human cells have never been investigated until recently. Although the ultra-high field
NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) machines currently available can generate around
20 T SMFs, they have very narrow bore size that is impractical to accommodate cell
culture plates. In addition, the animal and human cells need to be cultured with accu-
rate temperature, humidity and gas control, which make the NMR machines unsuit-
able to do these experiments. For large bore SMF equipment, there are currently only
very few magnets that can generate ≥20 T ultra-high SMFs, which are mostly used for
material science and physical science studies. People need to construct special sample
holders to make these magnets appropriate to study biological samples such as animal
and human cells, as well as small animal models. We recently constructed a cell incu-
bation system matching the large bore ultra-high magnet (Figs. 1.2f, 1.3). It can
provide accurate temperature and gas control for cell cultures and some small

animal models. Recently we used a human nasopharyngeal carcinoma CNE-2Z cell
line to study the effect of the 27 T ultra-strong SMF on its cell number, viability, cell
cycle, and microtubule cytoskeleton. We found that the 27 T SMF did not have an
immediate cytotoxic effect. However, it affected the spindle orientation and morphol-
ogy (Zhang et al. 2017a).
There are many studies show that the magnetic field intensity is one of the key
factors that cause the bio-effects differences. For example, Okano et al. found that
moderate intensity gradient SMF of 0.7 T (Bmax) significantly reduced the nerve
conduction velocity of frog nerve C fibers but gradient SMF of 0.21 T (Bmax) did
not (Okano et al. 2012). Our recent findings showed that 0.4–9 T moderate and
strong magnetic fields can affect EGFR orientation to inhibit its activity and cancer
cell growth while weaker SMFs cannot (Zhang et al. 2016b). In vitro kinase assays
using purified EGFR proteins showed that its kinase activity was inhibited by SMFs
in an intensity-dependent manner (Zhang et al. 2016b). In addition, we recently
found that 27 T ultra-strong SMF can affect spindle orientations in cells while mod-
erate intensity SMFs cannot (Zhang et al. 2017a).
The magnetic field intensity and their effects on biological samples need to be
examined case by case. Multiple studies show that some biological effects are
directly correlated with the SMF intensity and the higher magnetic field intensi-
ties are frequently associated with stronger phenotypes (Bras et al. 1998;
Takashima et al. 2004; Glade and Tabony 2005; Guevorkian and Valles 2006;
Zhang et al. 2016b). For example, the microtubules can be aligned by SMFs and
the alignment is increased in higher magnetic field intensity (Bras et al. 1998)
(Fig. 1.4). Takashima et al. studied the DNA integrity of fruit fly in strong SMFs of
0.5–14 T and found that although an increase linearly dependent on the magnetic

flux density was observed between 0.5 T and 2 T, but it was saturated at exposure
levels over 2 T and did not further increase at 5 or 14 T stronger SMFs (Takashima
et al. 2004). However, higher magnetic field intensity may have different or even
opposite biological effects compared to lower intensities. For example, Morris
et al. showed that application of a 10 or 70 mT, but not a 400 mT, SMF for 15 or
30 min immediately following histamine-induced edema resulted in a significant
reduction in edema formation (Morris and Skalak 2008). In addition, study in
Shang’s group demonstrated that 500 nT and 0.2 T SMFs promoted osteoclast
differentiation, formation and resorption, while 16 T had an inhibitory effect
(Zhang et al. 2016a).
1.1.3 Homogeneous vs. Inhomogeneous Magnetic Field
Depending on the spatial distribution of magnetic fields, SMFs can be classified as
homogeneous SMF and inhomogeneous SMF, in which the field strength can be
spatially constant (homogeneous) or different (inhomogeneous). Both homoge-
neous and inhomogeneous magnetic fields are present in many cases. For the elec-
tromagnets designed for SMFs, the center of the magnet provides a homogeneous
magnetic field, as long as the samples are placed within a certain range. For exam-
ple, Nakahara et al. showed the magnetic field intensity distribution as well as gradi-
ent distribution within a 10 T superconducting magnet (Nakahara et al. 2002). “0”
indicates the center of the magnet, where the magnetic flux density is maximum and
the field gradient is “0”. However, if the samples are placed far away from the cen-
ter, the magnetic field usually becomes inhomogeneous. For example, if the sample
is placed around 20 cm from the center of their magnet, the magnetic field density
becomes around 5 T and the field gradient is maximum. Figure 1.5 shows the mag-
netic field intensity distribution as well as gradient distribution within a 27 T water-
cooled magnet (Fig. 1.5). At the center of the magnet, the magnetic field flux density
is maximum and the field gradient is 0. In contrast, at around 7 cm away from the
center, the field gradient is maximum while the magnetic field intensity decreases to
< 20 T. Similarly, although the center of the MRI machine has a homogeneous mag-
netic field, MRI workers who stand step away from the MRI machines receive a
gradient (inhomogeneous) magnetic field.
To help evaluate exposure to gradient magnetic fields (GMFs) of staff working
with 1.5 and 3 T MRI machines, Iachininoto et al. used an exposure system repro-
ducing measured signals of the 1.5 T and 3 T MRI (1.5 T-protocol and 3 T-protocol)
and investigated their effects on hematopoietic stem cells. They exposed CD34+
cells obtained from six blood donors to 1.5 T-protocol and 3 T-protocol for 3 days
and then cultured for 4 weeks. Results showed that in vitro GMF exposure did not
affect cell proliferation but instead induced expansion of erythroid and monocytes
progenitors soon after exposure and for the subsequent 3 weeks. However, CD34+
cells isolated from MRI workers behaved similarly to sham-exposed CD34+ cells,
suggesting that other cells and/or microenvironment factors might prevent GMF

effects on hematopoietic stem cells in human bodies (Iachininoto et al. 2016). So far
there are no detrimental effects of MRI on regular MRI staff members have been
reported.
The magnetic forces used in magnetic levitation belong to the inhomogeneous
SMFs. The magnetic field intensity decreases along the upward direction away from
the center so that the forces can point to the upward direction to balance gravity. The
magnetic force acting on diamagnetic object is repulsive and if it is stronger than
gravity, the object will be levitated. The famous “flying frog” used a 16 T supercon-

ducting magnet that provided a SMF with a gradient that is large enough to balance
the gravity of the frog when it was placed at the upper part of the magnet, away from
the center (Fig. 1.6). Apparently, magnetic levitation can only be achieved in static
magnetic fields, but not in pulsed magnetic fields.
Besides the flying frog, there is another excellent example of using magnetic
levitation to “fly” much smaller living objects, single cells. In 2015, Durmus et al.
made a small magnetic levitation platform (Fig. 1.7a). This is based on the principle
that each cell has a unique cellular magnetic signature, predominantly owing to the
formation of intracellular paramagnetic reactive oxygen species. For example, can-
cer cells, white blood cells (WBC) and red blood cells (RBC) are all different from
each other (Fig. 1.7b). Apparently this platform is much smaller than the one that is
needed to fly a frog (Fig. 1.7c) and the magnetic field strength is also much weaker
(Fig. 1.7d) because cells are much smaller and lighter than frogs. They actually used
permanent magnets of moderate intensity (hundreds of militesla) in this platform
(Fig. 1.7d). This relative simple set up actually can give ultrasensitive density mea-
surements because each cell has a unique levitation profile (Fig. 1.7e) (Durmus
et al. 2015). They proposed that this technique could be used in label-free identifica-
tion and monitor of heterogeneous biological changes in various physiological con-
ditions, including drug screening in personalized medicine.
In fact, multiple groups have utilized magnetic levitation technique to mimic the
“weightless” condition and study its effects on cells. For example, the Shang group
did a series of studies to investigate the effects of SMF with a vertical gradient
using a large gradient strong magnet (Qian et al. 2009; Di et al. 2012; Qian et al.
2013). They compared the samples when they were placed at 0 gradient (1 g, indi-
cate that the gravity is normal), or at above or down the magnet center, where the
magnetic force is upward (0 g) or downward (2 g), respectively. The “0 g” position
mimics the weightless condition and the “2 g” position has the double gravity forces

density meter. (a) Illustration of the platform. (b) Final equilibrium height of cells in MagDense.
Owing to the magnetic induction (B) and gravity (g), cells are levitated in the channel and are
focused in an equilibrium plane where magnetic forces (Fmag) and buoyancy forces (Fb) equili-
brate each other. Magnetic susceptibility of the medium (χm) is chosen to be bigger than the cells’
magnetic susceptibility (χc). Different cell types with different densities, such as cancer cells (TC),
WBC, and RBC, are separated from each other. (c) Photograph of densitometry platform. Capillary
channel is introduced between two permanent neodymium magnets whose same poles are facing
each other (“N” to “N” and “S” to “S”). Mirrors are used to image samples along the side of the
channel. (d) FEM simulation results showing z and x component of magnetic induction (Bz, Bx)

nocarcinoma cells) (The figures were adapted from Durmus et al. (2015) (open access))
in the downward direction. Since “0 g” and “2 g” have identical magnetic field
intensity of around 12.5 T and the magnetic field direction (B) is upward at both
positions, their only difference is the direction of magnetic force. At “0 g” position,
the magnetic force that is equivalent to the gravity in the opposite direction so that

--- Page 24 ---

14 1 Parameters of Magnetic Fields and Their Differential Biological Effects
“0 g” can be used to investigate the effect of weightless condition. At “2 g” the
magnetic force is the same as the gravity so that it mimics the double weight condi-
tion. In the meantime, the “1 g” position provides homogenous SMF with no gradi-
ent so that it can be used to investigate the effect of magnetic field itself. Their
results showed that the magnetic field and the reduced gravity worked together to
affect integrin protein expression in osteoblast-like cells. Moreover, MTT assays
also revealed that the 12–16 T SMFs could increase the cell number/viability of
MG-63 and MC3T3-E1 cells since all three positions increased the MTT assay
reading. However, they observed the difference between “1 g” of 16 T to “0 g” and
“2 g” of 12 T, which is more likely due to the 4 T difference in magnetic field
intensity.
There are some other studies indicate that the SMF homogeneousness have
impacts on the biological effects. This is not surprising because the magnetic force
acting on any particular object is proportional to the magnetic field intensity, field
gradient, and the magnetic susceptibility of the object. Magnetic fields with low or
no field gradients can be used to induce a magnetic torque, rather than a magnetic
force, which acts on magnetic objects to move them along magnetic gradients. For
example, Kiss et al. compared the homogeneous and inhomogeneous SMFs gener-
ated by permanent magnets and found that although both homogenous and inho-
mogenous SMFs of moderate intensity can significantly reduce pain in mice, the
spatial SMF gradient might be responsible for the pain relief rather than the expo-
sure to the SMF itself (Kiss et al. 2013). In addition, the SMFs with high gradient
have been applied in red blood cell separation as well as malaria-infected red blood
cell separation and diagnosis (Owen 1978; Paul et al. 1981; Nam et al. 2013), which
will be further discussed in Chap. 4.
However, there is also some evidence shows that the magnetic intensity, rather
than the gradient, is the key factor. For example, Denegre et al. found that the cleav-
age plane of frog eggs can be reoriented by SMF of 16.7 T and they did not observe
differences when they placed the sample in the center (with homogeneous magnetic
field) or away from the center (with inhomogeneous magnetic field) (Denegre et al.
1998). They thought that the magnetic field intensity, but not the gradient, generates
effects on the samples. However, based on experimental and theoretical studies, we
think their observation could because the cell division can be affected by both
homogeneous and inhomogeneous SMFs as long as the magnetic field is strong
enough. Whether the homogeneous and inhomogeneous field produce different phe-
notypes on other biological samples still needs more systematic investigations. At
least one obvious difference is that the gradient field (inhomogeneous) with an
upward direction could lift a frog, but a homogeneous field with no gradient could
not.

1.1.4 Exposure Time
People are exposed to more and more electromagnetic radiation such as mobile
phones and power lines, whose effects on human health are still debated. One of the
constricting factors is that long-term exposure effects are still lacking. In contrast,
the human exposure to most SMFs, other than earth magnetic fields, is only for a
limited time. For example, the duration of the MRI examinations in hospitals is usu-
ally a few minutes to a couple of hours. Even for people who work with MRI, the
exposure time is relative limited. So far there are no known detrimental effects of
repetitive MRI exposure on human bodies, as long as they follow the MRI
instructions.
It has been shown that exposure time is a key factor that contributes to the differ-
ential effects of magnetic fields on biological samples. Different exposure time will
have variable effects to many aspects. For example, in 2003 Chionna et al. found that
U937 cells exposed to 6 mT SMF showed cell surface microvilli shape change after
24 h exposure but they have distorted cell shape after longer exposure (Chionna et al.
2003). In 2005, Chionna et al. found that cytoskeleton was also modified in a time
dependent manner in Hep G2 cells exposed to 6 mT SMF (Chionna et al. 2005). In
2008, Strieth et al. found that prolongation of the exposure time from 1 min to up to
3 h increased the 587 mT SMF-induced reduction effects on red blood cell velocity
(vRBC) and functional vessel density (Strieth et al. 2008). In 2009, Rosen and
Chastney exposed GH3 (rat pituitary tumor) cells to 0.5 T SMF for different time
points and found that the effects on cell growth is time dependent. After 1-week 0.5
T SMF exposure, the cell growth of GH3 cells was reduced by 22% but returned to
control level in a week after magnetic field retrieval. After 4-week 0.5 T SMF expo-
sure, the cell growth of GH3 cells was reduced to 51% and returned back to control
level after 4 weeks after magnetic field retrieval (Rosen and Chastney 2009). In 2011,
Sullivan et al. found that ROS in fetal human lung fibroblast WI-38 cells was signifi-
cantly increased by 18 h of moderate intensity SMF exposure but not 5 days of
exposure (Sullivan et al. 2011) although the underlying mechanism is still unknown.
Also in 2011, Tatarov et al. tested the effect of 100 mT SMF on mice bearing meta-
static breast tumor EpH4-MEK-Bcl2 cells. They found that exposure of the mice to
magnetic fields for 3 h or 6 h, but not 1 h, daily for as long as 4 weeks suppressed
tumor growth (Tatarov et al. 2011). In 2014, Gellrich et al. found that although both
SMF single exposure and repeated exposure increased the blood vessel leakiness and
reduced functional tumor microvessels, the repeated SMF exposure had stronger
effects (Gellrich et al. 2014). Recently, we tested the effect of 1 T SMF on human
skin cancer A431 cells and also observed the time-d ependent ROS changes (Fig. 1.8).
All these studies show that the SMF exposure time is a key factor for their effects on
biological systems and people should keep the exposure time in mind when they
design their own experiments or analyze the literature.

16 1 Parameters of Magnetic Fields and Their Differential Biological Effects
Fig. 1.8 1 T SMF increased ROS level in human skin cancer A431 cells in a time-dependent man-
ner. 4–5 × 105 cells/ml of A431 cells were plated one night ahead and exposed to a 1 T SMF for
different time points before the ROS levels were measured. The 1 T SMF was provided by placing
the cell plate on the top center of a 5 cm × 5 cm × 5 cm neodymium permanent magnet, with the
North pole up. The control group was placed with at least 30–40 cm away from the magnet with a
measured magnetic field intensity background of 0.9 Gs, which was 10,000-fold lower than the 1
T experimental groups (Our lab unpublished data) (Figure was provided by Huizhen Wang)
1.1.5 Magnetic Poles and Different Field Directions
Although the scientific explanation is apparently missing, there are some reports
saying that the different poles of a permanent magnet would have different effects
on living organisms. Most of these points were brought up by people in the mag-
netic therapy field and the most famous claim was brought up by Dr. Albert Roy
Davis and Walter C. Rawls. In 1974, Dr. Albert Roy Davis and Walter C. Rawls, Jr.
wrote a very interesting book “Magnetism and its effects on the living systems”.
They claimed that the N pole and S pole of the magnet could have dramatically dif-
ferent effects on living systems. The original finding was actually from an “earth-
worm incident” in 1936, in which the earthworms had eaten through one side of the
cardboard container near the S pole while the earthworms in the other container
near N pole did not have obvious effects. The magnetic strength was around 3000
Gauss (0.3 T) in this “earthworm incident”. Further analysis revealed that the earth-
worms near the South pole were “one- third larger, longer in length and larger in
diameter and were extremely active”. In this book, they also described many inter-
esting findings about the differential effects of North vs. South magnetic pole on
biological processes, such as the ripen speed of green tomatoes, radish seed germi-
nation, small animals, as well as cancers. Overall, they think the North pole is the
“negative energy pole” which arrests life growth and/or development while and the
South pole is the “positive energy pole” that increases life, growth and development.
Although their claims have not been scientifically proven, there are many other non-
scientific reports supporting the Davis and Rawls’s claims. However, since no illus-
tration or picture was provided in their book about these experiments, the relative

--- Page 27 ---

1.1 I ntroduction 17
location of the earthworms or other samples they tested near the magnets is unclear.
Moreover, there are many remaining questions. For example, whether the North or
South pole magnets could generate the same effects when they were placed on the
top vs. bottom, or at the side of the samples are completely unknown. Therefore, I
think it is necessary for scientists to perform carefully designed and well controlled
studies to test their claims. From my point of view, it is very likely that the magnetic
field direction, but not the magnetic pole itself, could generate some differences on
biological samples. More researches are needed to draw an explicit conclusion.
There are actually two studies have indicated that SMFs of different orientations
could generate differential results in mice and cells. Milovanovich et al. found that
128 mT static magnetic fields affected various organs in mice (Milovanovich et al.
2016) (Fig. 1.9). They compared the SMFs with two opposite directions, the upward
field direction (field direction was opposite to the gravity) and downward direction
(field direction was the same to the gravity). In the mice serum, the HDL level was
increased by both upward and downward SMFs. In addition, SMFs of both direc-
tions can decrease the amount of total white blood cell and lymphocytes in serum,
granulocytes in spleen and inflammation in kidney (Fig. 1.9a) (Milovanovich et al.
2016). However, it is interesting that the upward SMF caused increased spleen cells
but the downward SMF did not (Fig. 1.9b), while the downward SMF decreased the
granulocytes number in serum but the upward SMF did not have as significant effect
(Fig. 1.9a) (Milovanovich et al. 2016).
In addition, recently, a separate study by De Luka et al. also suggested that the
moderate intensity magnetic fields with different orientations may have differential
effects on copper level in mice brain (De Luka et al. 2016). They measured the zinc
and copper levels in different organs in mice that were exposed to SMFs (98 mT
max) of upward or downward directions. They found that SMF could change the
zinc and copper levels differentially in different organs. More interesting, the SMF
of downward direction seemed to have more obvious effects (De Luka et al. 2016).
The difference was small but statistically significant.
At the same time, there was also evidence showing that the magnetic field direc-
tion or magnet pole does not make a difference. In 2011, Sullivan et al. examined
fetal human lung fibroblast WI-38 cells for their response to magnetic fields that
were generated by pairs of “N” vs. “S” magnetic pole facing each other but with
different orientations (Fig. 1.10). In this way, the cells placing between the magnets
were exposed to magnetic fields of different orientation, and they were also relative
closer to either “N” pole or “S” pole. They examined cell attachment and cell growth
curves and found that the different exposure methods both could decrease cell
attachment and cell growth but there was no difference between them (Sullivan
et al. 2011). I think the different observations in these studies are likely due to the
differences in biological samples examined. It is interesting that not only both
Milovanovich et al. (2016) and De Luka et al. (2016) observed differential responses
of mice when they were exposed to magnetic fields of different directions, they also
showed that different organs responded differently. Based on results from their stud-
ies, the magnetic field direction can make difference in some organs or on some
types of cells while have no difference in other organs or cell types. Therefore it is

Fig. 1.10 Field direction did not make differences on human lung fibroblast WI-38 cell attach-
ment or proliferation. In 2011, Sullivan et al. compared the different exposure methods on WI-38
cells attachment and proliferation but did not observe obvious difference (Figures are based on
results from Sullivan et al. (2011))
not too surprising that Sullivan et al. examined only one cell type, fetal human lung
fibroblast WI-38 cells, and did not observe any field direction-induced differences.
Overall the magnetic field direction or magnetic pole-induced bio-effects differ-
ences are not well supported yet. Scientific investigations are still lacking and mech-
anistic explanations are also missing. If the “N” vs. “S” magnetic pole induced
dramatic differences in living systems proposed by Dr. Albert Roy Davis and Walter
C. Rawls are real, it would help to explain some inconsistencies in current literature
because most people did not pay attention to the magnetic poles in their studies,
including us in our earlier experiments. However, based on our knowledge, the
effects are likely not as simple and clear-cut as claimed by Dr. Albert Roy Davis and
Walter C. Rawls. Our lab is currently investigating this issue systematically by com-
paring different magnetic poles and field directions on different types of cells for
their effects on multiple aspects. Our initial data suggest that the effects seem to be
cell type- and cellular activity-dependent (our unpublished data). Since most studies
so far did not provide information about the magnetic pole information, we strongly
recommend that people should pay attention to the magnets they use and keep a
clear record about the magnetic field direction and/or the magnetic poles in their
studies. This is actually crucial because the results could be totally different.
1.1.6 Factors Contributing to the Lack of Consistencies
in Bioeffects Studies of Magnetic Fields
As mentioned above, despite the numerous scientific research and non-scientific
case reports about the magnetic effects on living organisms, the magnetic field
effects on biological systems are still looked upon with doubts and suspicions by
many scientists outside of the field, as well as by the mainstream medical commu-
nity. This is largely due to a lack of consensus on the biological effects in general
that are backed up by solid scientific evidences and explanations. We have to admit
that the countless scientific researches or non-scientific case reports are enriched
with many seemingly contradictory results, which make many people confused and

--- Page 30 ---

20 1 Parameters of Magnetic Fields and Their Differential Biological Effects
hence become suspicious, including myself a few years ago. Then we carefully
analyzed the evidence in the literature about the biological effects of magnetic fields
to try to view them collectively in a scientific way. We found that most of these
inconsistencies can be explained by the different parameters of either the magnetic
fields or the biological samples people used in individual studies. For example, the
magnetic field parameters mentioned above in this chapter all contribute to the dif-
ferential effects, such as the types of magnetic fields, the field intensities and fre-
quencies of magnetic fields, the homogeneity and directions of the fields, the
magnetic poles and the exposure time. More importantly, we found that the biologi-
cal samples people examined directly affect the magnetic effects. For example, we
recently found that both cell types and cell densities have direct impact on the
effects of 1 T SMF on cells (Zhang et al. 2017b). The cancer vs. non-cancer cells
from the same tissue responded completely differently to the same magnetic field.
Unexpectedly, the same cell line responded totally different when they were seeded
at different cell density and we found that the EGFR-mTOR-Akt cell signaling
pathway is likely involved in this regulation (Zhang et al. 2017b). In fact, even nor-
mal (non-cancer) cells from the same tissue have different responses to the magnetic
field. The Shang group compared the effects of 500 nt, 0.2 T, 16 T on osteoblast
MC3T3-E1 cells (Zhang et al. 2014b), as well as pre-osteoclast Raw264.7 cells
(Zhang et al. 2016a) and found that the osteoblast and osteoclast cells responded
totally opposite to these SMFs. Both hypo and moderate magnetic fields reduced
osteoblast differentiation but promoted osteoclast differentiation, formation and
resorption. In contrast, 16 T SMF increased osteoblast differentiation inhibited
osteoclast differentiation. They also wrote a particular review to systematically
summarize the effects of SMFs on bone that is worth to look into (Zhang et al.
2014a). More surprisingly, some people (including ourselves) found that even cell
passage number could affect the experimental results, which will be further dis-
cussed in Chap. 4.
In 2009, Colbert et al. wrote a comprehensive review “Static Magnetic Field
Therapy: A Critical Review of Treatment Parameters” (Colbert et al. 2009). Their
purpose was to summarize SMF studies involving the application of permanent
magnets in humans. In this review, they critically evaluated the reporting quality of
ten essential SMF dosing and treatment parameters and proposed a set of criteria for
reporting SMF treatment parameters in future clinical trials (Fig. 1.11). They
reviewed 56 studies about magnetic therapy, in which 42 studies were done in
patient populations and 14 studies were done in healthy volunteers. As we have
discussed in earlier part of this Chapter, the magnetic field parameters greatly influ-
ence their effects on biological systems. However, by analyzing ten magnetic field
related parameters in these studies, including the magnet materials, magnet dimen-
sions, pole configuration, measure field strength, frequency of application, duration
of application, site of application, magnet support device, target tissue, distance
from magnet surface, and found that 61% of the studies failed to provide enough

experimental details about the SMF parameters to permit protocol replication by
other investigators. Apparently, the lack of sufficiently detailed description of SMF
parameters greatly prevented people from getting consensus conclusions from these
studies. We strongly encourage people in the field of magnetic field studies to clearly
label their parameters, such as the ten parameters listed in the Colbert paper, in their
own research.
Last but not the least, there are also some other factors contributing to these dif-
ferences, such as instrument and technical sensitivities, which have been greatly
improved in the past few decades. Nowadays people have much advanced instru-
ments and techniques, which should enable more findings that were not detectable
before. The absence of magnetic field effects in some studies may simply due to the
technical limitations and/or inadequate control of experimental conditions. We
should take advantage of the modern technologies to answer related questions. For
example, we recently used liquid-phase STM to get high resolution single molecu-
lar images of proteins (Wang et al. 2016) and combined with biochemistry, cell
biology as well as molecular dynamics simulation to reveal that moderate and strong
SMFs could change EGFR orientation to inhibit its activation and some cancer cell
growth (Zhang et al. 2016b). At the same time, we should keep all relevant factors
in mind, such as magnetic field type and intensity, cell type and density when we do
our own research and analyze the relevant literature. This will help us reduce the
diversity and contradictions in this field and also help us to correctly understand the
mechanism of the biological effects caused by the magnetic field.

22 1 Parameters of Magnetic Fields and Their Differential Biological Effects
1.2 Conclusion
Since the human body itself is an electromagnetic object, it is not surprising that the
magnetic fields could produce some effects on them. There are indeed many con-
vincing experimental evidences as well as theoretical explanations about the effects
of magnetic field on some biomolecules, such as the cytoskeleton microtubules,
membrane, as well as some proteins (will be discussed in Chapter 3). In the mean-
time, most studies in the literature on the biological and health effects of magnetic
fields had been inconclusive or contradictory, which was largely due to the various
parameters used in individual studies, including the magnet fields themselves, sam-
ples examined, as well as the experimental set up. It seems that there is a large gap
between atom/molecular level and cell/tissue/organism level that people need to fill
in to correctly and scientifically understand the biological effects of magnetic field.
For now, experimental and theoretical studies are both at a very preliminary stage.
To help us get a more complete understanding of the biological effects of magnetic
fields and their underlying mechanisms, more systematic, well controlled studies
with fully described experimental details are strongly encouraged. Furthermore,
increased collaborations between scientists in physics, biology and chemists are
necessary to make substantial progresses in this emerging field.
Ethics The frog research studies in this chapter had their ethics approved. For
Okano et al. 2012, it was stated that “the animal experiments were carried out with
the approval of the Animal Ethics Committee of Chiba University (Chiba, Japan)”.

Static Magnetic Fields (SMFs) on Human
Bodies
Abstract This chapter summarizes the effects of static magnetic fields (SMFs) on
human bodies. Some commonly seen SMFs, such as the weak earth magnetic field
that we are all exposed to, moderate to ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) in the hospitals and research institutes, as well as SMF-based magnetic thera-
pies, which have a long history but still lack of solid explanation or sufficient experi-
mentation from a scientific point of view. Magnetobiology and biomagnetism are
also briefly discussed.
Keywords Static magnetic fields • Earth magnetic field • Magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) • Magnetic therapy
2.1 Introduction
From a simplified view, the human body is mainly composed of weak diamagnetic
materials, including water, proteins and lipids. The term diamagnetic means that it
repels with the externally applied magnetic field. In a magnetic field, the motions of
electrons in diamagnetic molecules make small changes, which generate weak mag-
netic fields in the opposite direction to the externally applied magnetic field.
Although the diamagnetic properties of most living organisms are very weak, since
the repulsive force is proportional to the product of the field intensity and the field
gradient, the forces can be amplified by strong magnetic field. The most famous
case is the “flying frogs” about 20 years ago, which we mentioned in Chap. 1.
People put small diamagnetic objects such as water drops, flowers, grasshoppers as
well as small frogs in the 16 T strong SMF produced by a vertical electromagnet and
levitated those small objects. Theoretically the human body could also be levitated.
However, due to the size and weight of our human bodies, the levitation would need
a much stronger magnet and has not been accomplished yet.
In recent years, people have increased exposure to different kinds of electric
magnetic fields, most of which are dynamic magnetic fields, such 50–60 Hz power
line electromagnetic fields as well as radiofrequency electromagnetic fields.
Therefore these magnetic fields have attracted paramount interests in the past, espe-
cially around 1970–2000. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there were multiple

epidemiologic studies suggested a link between occupational electromagnetic expo-
sure with an increased incidence of leukemia, as well as some other diseases, such
as breast cancers. However, although these associations raised many public con-
cerns, further investigations failed to establish a link between the magnetic exposure
with these diseases. There are many reviews and books about this topic and we will
not discuss about the details here. The focus of our book is SMFs, which have non-
changing magnetic fields over time (0 Hz). For SMFs, the most common ones that
people are exposed to include the weak but widely spread earth magnetic field (~0.5
Gauss, ~50 μT), MRI scanners in the hospitals (0.5–3 T), as well as permanent
magnets of various magnetic intensities that some people may use as alternative
medicine for some chronic medical conditions such as chronic pain relief, as well as
small magnets that are frequently used in household items such as refrigerators, toys
and accessories.
For SMFs, the most updated fact sheet and guidelines by WHO (World Health
Organization) and ICNIRP (International commission on non-ionizing radiation
protection) were in 2006. For a general view of the current agreement of the mag-
netic field exposure standards, people can always check the website of ICNIRP for
the most updated guidance for electromagnetic exposure (http://www.icnirp.org/).
ICNIRP is an independent organization, which provides people with scientific
advice and guidance on the health and environmental effects of non-ionizing radia-
tion (NIR) (http://www.icnirp.org/en/frequencies/index.html). NIR is electromag-
netic radiation that does not have enough energy to ionize atoms or molecules.
Other than SMFs, ICNIRP also cover multiple topics about non-ionizing electro-
magnetic radiation, such as the electromagnetic radiation from the sun, household
electrical appliances, mobile phones, Wi-Fi, and microwave ovens. Although some
people may not agree with some specific points, ICNIRP guidelines are still the
most well accepted standards for public exposure to non-ionizing radiation. It
should be mentioned that due to the public attention, rapid development of technol-
ogy and huge amount of accompanied studies, the most updated fact sheet and
guidelines for radiofrequency magnetic fields published by WHO and ICNIRP were
in 2014. Meanwhile, the safety issues of SMFs caused much less worries compared
to mobile phones. The current updated fact sheet and guidelines by WHO and
ICNIRP about SMFs are in 2006, which is already 10 years from now. There are
also some fine and comprehensive reviews that people can look into (Schenck 2000;
Valentinuzzi 2004; Feychting 2005).
In the meantime, with the development of high field MRI machines in the hospi-
tals, people have increased exposure to high magnetic fields, which unsurprisingly
raised new concerns. In 2011, Yamaguchi-sekino et al. wrote an updated review
about the biological effects of electromagnetic fields and updated safety guidelines
for strong SMFs (Yamaguchi-Sekino et al. 2011) that people can find many useful
information. At the same time, there are various researches started to unravel the
potential beneficial effects of SMFs on human, which may provide some action
mechanisms of the magnetic therapy that have a long but debating history. Therefore,
the effects of static magnetic fields and their effects on human bodies certainly
require more research to get a better understanding.

2.2 Earth Magnetic Field
The most common SMF that all people are exposed to is the earth magnetic field,
geomagnetic field (GMF), which is around 0.5 Gauss/50 μT (0.3–0.6 Gauss,
depending on locations). It is actually quasi-static, which means it can fluctuate
slightly. Geomagnetic field is much weaker compared to other types of SMF expo-
sure but it is present virtually everywhere and is exceptionally important to the liv-
ing organism on earth. It is proposed that planets without an intact global magnetic
field are subject to atmospheric stripping by the solar wind. For example, people
think that Mars does not have a global magnetic field so that the solar wind has
contributed to the loss of water and the erosion of Mars’ atmosphere. In contrast, the
earth has its magnetic field (magnetosphere), which is proposed to protect our whole
planet from solar wind stripping (Fig. 2.1).
It is well known that birds, bees, turtles and some other animals are shown to
sense earth magnetic fields for direction during migration (Lohmann and Johnsen
2000; Wiltschko and Wiltschko 2005; Johnsen and Lohmann 2008). There are many
studies about the earth magnetic fields and magnetoception of animals. It is believed
that many birds have a compass in their eyes because their retinas have magnetic
field sensors, which make them “see” the earth magnetic field in addition to their
normal vision. The magnetic sensor was assigned to cryptochromes for many years
until recently another protein was also found to participate in magnetic sensing
(details will be discussed in Chap. 5). Both CRY (cryptochrome) and MagR seem
to be important for the magnetoception in birds but more in vivo studies are neces-
sary to draw a definite conclusion. In addition, it is interesting that recently Vidal-
Gadea et al. found that the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans orients to the earth’s

--- Page 39 ---

30 2 Static Magnetic Fields (SMFs) on Human Bodies
magnetic field during vertical burrowing and the migrations and magnetic orienta-
tion required the TAX-4 cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel in the AFD sensory
neuron pair (Rankin and Lin 2015; Vidal-Gadea et al. 2015).
More information about the SMF effects on microorganisms, plants and animals
will be discussed in Chap. 5. Although the progress in this particular field is big in
the past few years, more efforts are definitely needed to unravel the exact and
detailed mechanisms to explain the animal behaviours related to earth magnetic
fields. For example, people found some interesting but enigmatic phenomena that
dogs like to align their bodies along the earth magnetic field when they excrete
(defecation and urination) (Hart et al. 2013).
For humans, although we also have the proteins that are believed to be the recep-
tors for the magnetic fields, such as CRY and MagR, there is no solid evidence to
support the presence of magnetoception. Although for now, we think humans cannot
detect, or at least cannot feel the earth magnetic field, the magnetic sensing is still
one of the most significant unsolved problems in the biology field. Actually,
researchers have knockout the cryptochrome in flies to make them insensitive to the
magnetic field and found that the magnetic reception can be restored by the human
cryptochrome (Foley et al. 2011). This means that human cryptochrome is func-
tional as a magnetosensor, at least in flies. However, why humans do not sense
magnetic fields as birds do? Roswitha Wiltschko, who was one of the scientists who
first discovered the magnetic sense of birds, said, “To sense the magnetic field, one
does not only need a molecule like cryptochrome, but also an apparatus that picks
up the changes in that molecule and mediates it to the brain. Drosophila obviously
has this apparatus, but humans? I have my doubts.” It is possible that we have other
sensations that dominate the magnetoception, or just because we miss some key
components along the magnetoception pathway. It is interesting that Thoss et al.
indicate that the GMF could actually affect human visual system (Thoss and Bartsch
2003; Thoss and Bartsch 2007) although the mechanism is not completely under-
stood. Apparently, this field still remains blurred and we are still far away from
understanding the nature of it in both animals and potentially, in humans. More
research is certainly needed to answer these fundamental questions.
It is interesting that there are some researches on humans show that GMF could
produce some neurological and cardiovascular effects. Burch et al. indicate that the
GMF can affect melatonin secretion (Burch et al. 2008), which is a possible mecha-
nism for the neurological and cardiovascular effects of altered GMF. In addition,
Lipnicki et al. show that there may even be some association between GMF activity
with dream bizarreness (Lipnicki 2009). However, there are also some reports that
reported negative results. For example, in 2002, Sastre et al. examined the effects of
controlled changes in the GMF on fifty human volunteers for electroencephalogram
(EEG) and did not find any obvious correlation (Sastre et al. 2002). Since different
aspects were measured in these individual studies, they are not exactly comparable.
It is obvious that more researches are needed to address this question.
On the other hand, there are also some evidences showing that in the absence of
GMF, frequently referred to Hypomagnetic field (HMF, which is not high magnetic
field in other cases), the gene expression, cell proliferation, migration and adhesion

of some human cancer cells could be affected (Martino and Castello 2011; Mo et al.
2013, 2014, 2016). For example, Mo et al. did multiple studies about the effects of
HMF on human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. In 2013, they showed that continu-
ous HMF exposure significantly increases the proliferation of human SH-SY5Y
neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 2.2) by promoting cell cycle progression (Mo et al. 2013);
In 2014, they compared the transcriptome profiles of SH-SY5Y cells exposed to
either the HMF or the GMF and found multiple genes are differentially expressed,
including MAPK1 and CRY2 (Mo et al. 2014). In 2016, they found that in HMF,
SH-SY5Y cells have reduced F-actin cytoskeleton as well as reduced adhesion and
migration (Mo et al. 2016). In addition, HMF was also found to reduce the ROS
level in human pancreatic AsPC-1 cancer cell line and bovine pulmonary artery
endothelial cells (PAEC) (Martino and Castello 2011), which is consistent with
some studies reporting that SMFs could increase ROS in some cancer cells (will be

discussed in Chap. 4). In addition, they also did some studies in Xenopus laevis
(African clawed frog) and found that HMF could cause a decrease in horizontal
third cleavage furrows and abnormal morphogenesis in Xenopus embryos (Mo et al.
2012). Their results indicate that a brief (2 h) exposure to HMF is sufficient to inter-
fere with the development of Xenopus embryos at cleavage stages. Although their
study was done in frogs, the impact of HMF on mitotic spindle and cell division
could also be potentially comparable in other organisms, including humans. This is
especially critical for developing embryos.
In conclusion, based on the current available evidences, no matter whether or not
humans can sense the earth magnetic fields for direction like some animals do, it is
likely that our bodies are indeed affected, or more accurately, protected by the earth
magnetic fields. However, more investigations are strongly needed to draw an
unambiguous conclusion.
2.3 Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Besides the weak earth magnetic field (50 μT), nowadays people have more chances
to get exposed to much stronger SMF, such as MRI scanners in the hospitals. MRI
has a superior soft-tissue contrast compared to other radiological imaging methods,
which makes it a powerful tool in many physiological and functional applications.
The SMF of the MRI system is exceptionally strong compared to the earth magnetic
field. Currently, most MRI scanners in hospitals for regular patients are 0.5–3 Tesla,
which is around 10,000–60,000 times greater than the earth magnetic field.

MRI is considered to be a safe technique as long as the operation follows the
guidelines. So far, after several years of monitoring, there are no harmful effects
reported on frequent MRI operators, patients or NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance)
users. There are also some lab studies at cellular levels about the safety of MRI. For
example, in 2003, Schiffer et al. used conditions that are relevant for patients during
MRI for their effects on HL60 and EA2 cells. They examined different types of
magnetic fields, including SMFs of 1.5 and 7.05 T, extremely low frequency mag-
netic gradient fields (ELFMGFs) with +/− 10 mT/m and 100 Hz, as well as +/− 100
mT/m and 100 Hz, pulsed high frequency MF in the radiofrequency (RF) range
(63.6 MHz, 5.8 microT), and a combination of these different magnetic fields. They
exposed the cells for up to 24 h and did not find cell cycle changes (Schiffer et al.
2003). Recently, Sammet wrote a review about the magnetic resonance safety
(Sammet 2016). For example, people with pacemakers should not use MRI because
the pacemakers may be reprogrammed or turned off by the magnetic field. People
with some other implants, such as ferrous intra-cranial vascular clips, should also
avoid MRI because the strong magnetic field of MRI may cause possible movement
of the implants. Cell phones and credit cards may be damaged by the magnetic
fields so that they should also be kept out of the MRI room. In addition, the patients
should be moved slowly into the magnet bore to reduce the possibility of vertigo
and nausea. It has been shown that no short term cardiac or cognitive effects are
observed following significant exposure to 8 T (Kangarlu et al. 1999) and the 2009
ICNIRP guidance (ICNIRP 2009) concluded that there is no indication of serious
health effects from acute exposure of stationary humans to SMFs of up to 8 T,
except that people may have unpleasant feelings such as vertigo. Based on the avail-
able scientific data, the limit of exposure for general public was set to 400 mT. This
is calculated by applying a reduction factor of 5 on 2 T, which has been proved to
have no demonstrated robust effect on animals (Gaffey and Tenforde 1983; Tenforde
2005) or humans. The exposure of SMFs above 8 T requires approval of the research
protocol by an Institutional Review Board as well as the informed consent of the
subjects. It is well recognized that for the regular exposure to the MRI, there are
some commonly experienced symptoms including nausea and headaches, which are
all reversible.
Although the magnetic field intensities of the range of MRI machines in hospi-
tals (0.5–3 T) are currently considered to be safe to human bodies, more investiga-
tions are still needed to achieve a more complete understanding. Large amount of
data show that there is no increased risk for leukemia or other types of cancers by
SMFs. In fact, increasing experimental evidences from biological labs indicate that
the SMFs could inhibit cancer cell growth and have a potential in cancer treatment
in the future, which will be discussed in later chapters in this book. In addition, the
whole body exposure of mice to the 3 T homogeneous SMF of a clinical MR resulted
in a statistically significant antinociceptive activity (Laszlo and Gyires 2009).
However, besides the potential beneficial effects of MRI within the 0.5–3 T range,
it should be mentioned that there are also some studies indicate that they may have
some other effects on human. For example, 3 T SMF was shown to suppress human
chondrocyte growth in vitro and affect recovery of damaged knee cartilage in vivo
in the pig model (Hsieh et al. 2008).

MRI machines with higher magnetic field strength are already developed. For
now, there are 7–9.4 T MRI machines have been used on animal studies in research
as well as on human bodies at preclinical stage (Kangarlu et al. 1999; Adair 2000;
Miyakoshi 2005; Zhang et al. 2015). For the short-term exposures experienced by
volunteers and patients, no readily demonstrated health risks were identified. In
addition, since the publication of the 2009 ICNIRP guidance (ICNIRP 2009), there
have been a large number of studies evaluating the physiological and neurobehav-
ioral influence in human bodies exposed to SMFs of up to 9.4 T. Current findings
show that for the SMFs used in MRI up to 9.4 T, there are no known detrimental
biological effects on human bodies. In the meanwhile, people are currently investi-
gating on building MRI machines with ultra-high magnetic fields. Increased mag-
netic fields can help providing enhanced sensitivity, higher resolution as well as
decreased acquisition time. For example, high magnetic fields increased our capa-
bility to observe and investigate in vivo biological processes that are unavailable or
obscure in low magnetic fields. In 2010, Schepkin et al. tested mouse and rat brains
using a 21.1 T MRI, the highest field MRI to date, at the National High Magnetic
Field Laboratory (NHMFL) in the United States. They were able to achieve imaging
resolution of 50 μm (Fig. 2.4), which is much higher than the lower field MRIs. In
addition, they also compared 21.1 T MRI to 9.4 MRI and found that the 21.1 T MRI
can provide much more detailed features about the tissues and blood vessels in the
rodent brain (Schepkin et al. 2010). This showed the promising future of developing
similar MRI for human. However, it is still not very clear about the biological effects

of higher magnetic fields, especially the ultra-high magnetic field of 20 T and above.
Since our knowledge of the biological effects of SMFs will guide us for future
increase in magnetic field intensity for MRI to benefit medical diagnosis and treat-
ment, more studies are definitely needed to investigate the biological effects of
ultra-high magnetic fields, which are necessary for the future application of ultra-
high field MRI machines on humans.
Therefore, although current MRI machines in the hospitals are considered to be
safe, the long term consequences and their potential beneficial effects on human
bodies are still incomplete identified. In addition, obvious advantages of ultra-high
field MRI machines encourage people to create ultra-high field MRIs for technical
benefits. This also calls for attention for necessary studies for the accompanied
safety issues. More efforts are needed to help establish guidelines for occupational
staff and patient exposures to high SMFs.
2.4 Magnetic Therapy Using SMFs
Looking back into history, magnetic therapy has been debated for thousands of
years and there were multiple rounds of up and downs (Basford 2001). It is interest-
ing that the lack of solid scientific explanation for the working mechanism of mag-
netic field on human bodies does not really prevent people from using magnets at
their own wish. Although it is never a mainline medicine, there are still many people
currently using magnetic therapy as an alternative and complementary treatment for
some chronic diseases, such as arthritis, wound healing and analgesic therapy (pain
relief). Every year, the magnetic therapy products have billions of dollars in sales
worldwide. In fact this is mostly because many people using magnetic therapy do
find themselves benefiting from them, such as some products designed for pain
relief. For example, there are some magnetic therapy products on amazon.com. A
few of these products have hundreds of positive comments claiming that they could
alleviate the pain and discomfort, especially the magnet bracelet that has some rela-
tive stronger magnets embedded. By browsing the magnetic therapy products on the
market, it is not surprising that the magnetic bracelets that received good reviews
usually have their magnetic flux densities clearly labelled and most of them are
within the range of hundreds to thousands of gausses (0.01–1 T).
Despite the fact that magnetic therapy has a long history, it is still not well
accepted by the mainstream medicine. In some cases, it is even considered to be
pseudoscience. The doubts people have are mainly due to the lack of consistency
and scientific explanations (as discussed in Chap. 1). There are many efforts that
have been devoted to trying to resolve this issue and some of them did provide posi-
tive results. For example, In 1997 Vallbona et al. conducted a well-controlled study
on fifty post-polio patients and found that the 300–500 Gauss (0.03–0.05 T) SMFs
(active magnetic device) significantly reduced the patient pain level from 9.6 to 4.4
(p < 0.0001) on a 10-point scale (Vallbona et al. 1997) (Table 2.1, top). It is interest-
ing that the sham exposure system that maximally mimics the magnetic device

The top table shows that the pain score is efficiently reduced by active magnetic device. The bot-
tom table shows that the % of patients that have effective pain relief is much higher in the active
magnetic device group. Both tables were based on results from (Vallbona et al. 1997)
(inactive device) also had some placebo effects and reduce the patient pain level
from 9.5 to 8.4. However, it is obvious that the pain level change in the SMF-treated
group is fivefold more efficient than the placebo-device group (5.2 vs. 1.1, p <
0.0001). In addition, 76% of the patients in the active magnetic device group
reported much reduced pain while the placebo-device group only have 19% patient
(Vallbona et al. 1997) (Table 2.1, bottom). This study is well known and much bet-
ter than most other magnetic therapy studies in a scientific point of view. It was done
with proper controls, which provided people with convinced evidences that SMFs
could indeed have beneficial effects on pain relief. More studies are needed to carry
out in scientific way like this to test the claims made in the field of magnetic
therapy.
Another two scientifically done studies in the field of magnetic therapy were by
Alfano et al. and Juhasz et al. In 2001, Alfano et al. did a randomized, placebo-
controlled, 6-month trial conducted from 1997 through 1998 on people with fibro-
myalgia (Alfano et al. 2001). In addition to sham controls, they compared a group
of people that was exposed to sleep pads with magnets that provided low uniform
static magnetic field of negative polarity (Functional Pad A) with a group exposed
to sleep pads with magnets that varied both spatially and in polarity (Functional Pad
B). In fact, they did find that the Functional Pad A had the most significant effects
and both Functional Pad A and B groups showed improvements in functional status,
pain intensity level, tender point count, and tender point intensity after 6 months of
treatment, but they did not differ significantly from changes in the control groups
(Alfano et al. 2001). Therefore although this study show that the magnetic sleep
pads have the potential to work, the effects were not statistically significant. I think
the major reason for the lack of efficiency in their study might be the magnetic field
strength, which is too low (below 1 mT). Increasing the magnetic field strength to

2.4 M agnetic Therapy Using SMFs 37
hundred to thousand gauss might work. However, scientific studies are needed to be
done to prove this. Moreover, in 2014, Juhász et al. did a randomized, self- and
placebo-controlled, double-blind, pilot study included 16 patients diagnosed with
erosive gastritis. They used inhomogeneous SMF-exposure intervention at the lower
sternal region over the stomach with peak-to-peak magnetic induction of 3 mT and
30 mT m(−1) gradient at the target site. They did found clinically and statistically
significant beneficial effect of the SMF- over sham-exposure on the erosive gastritis
symptoms. The average effect of inhibition was 56% (p = 0.001). This indicates that
inhomogeneous SMF could be a potential alternative or complementary method for
erosive gastritis (Juhasz et al. 2014). It is interesting that their magnetic field inten-
sity seems much lower than most other studies that have positive results.
Current evidences show that magnetic field strength is a key issue for potential
magnetic therapy applications. Overall, it is believed that magnetic fields with too
weak strength are not enough to produce enough energy. As mentioned above, the
permanent magnets most people used for magnetic therapy have been proved to be
effective ranging from hundreds to thousands of gauss. For example, in 2002, Brown
et al. showed that 0.05 T SMF for 4 weeks could reduce chronic pelvic pain in
patient (Brown et al. 2002). In 2011, Kovacs-Balint et al. did a research on 15 young
healthy human volunteers and found that a inhomogeneous 0.33 T (Bmax) SMF
exposure for 30 min could increase the thermal pain threshold (TPT) (Kovacs-Balint
et al. 2011). However, it is possible, and very likely, that different symptoms have
different requirement for the magnetic field intensity, as well as other magnetic field
parameters.
Besides human studies, there are also some animal and cellular studies about the
potential application of SMFs in multiple diseases. For example, in 2008 Gyires
et al. showed that the inhomogeneous 2–754 mT SMF could significantly reduce the
visceral pain (57%, P < 0.005) elicited by intraperitoneal injection of 0.6% acetic
acid in mice (Gyires et al. 2008). In 2009 Laszlo et al. showed that 3 T MRI had
significant beneficial effects on pain relief in mice (Laszlo and Gyires 2009). In
2012, Okano et al. found that gradient moderate intensity SMF of 0.7 T (Bmax)
exposure for 4–6 hours could reduce the nerve conduction velocity of C fibers,
which are responsible for pain transmission (Okano et al. 2012). In 2013 Kiss et al.
did a study in mice show that moderate intensity of both inhomogeneous (3–477
mT) and homogeneous (145 mT) SMFs that are provided by permanent magnets
can have a significant beneficial effects on pain relief (Kiss et al. 2013). In 2013,
Vergallo et al. examined the effect of inhomogeneous SMF (0.476 T max) exposure
on the production of different cytokines from human lymphocytes and macrophages
(Vergallo et al. 2013). They found that the moderate intensity inhomogeneous SMF
treatment for 6–24 h has a significant inhibitory effect on the release of pro-
inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-a from macrophages as compared to
control. In addition, the SMF increased the production of anti-inflammatory cyto-
kine IL-10 from lymphocytes. As brought up multiple times before, most of these
magnetic field intensities that show positive results for pain relief and inflammation
reduction are a few hundred to a few thousand Gauss. However, we do not exclude
the possibility that lower magnetic field intensities will also have some effects on

--- Page 47 ---

38 2 Static Magnetic Fields (SMFs) on Human Bodies
some biological samples, or have some other different effects. There were also some
mechanistic studies about the SMF-induced pain relief. Gyires et al. showed that the
analgesic action induced by inhomogeneous 2–754 mT SMF could be inhibited by
subcutaneous administration of naloxone, irreversible micro-opioid receptor antag-
onist beta-funaltrexamine and delta-opioid receptor antagonist naltrindole, but not
the kappa-opioid receptor antagonist norbinaltorphimine, which suggests that the
antinociceptive effect is likely to be mediated by micro and delta-opioid receptors
(Gyires et al. 2008). More details and information are discussed in Chaps. 6 and 7
for the potential application of SMFs in cancer and other diseases.
In the meantime, not surprisingly, there are some experimental evidences show-
ing that certain magnetic therapy products fail to produce positive effects, even for
the magnets that have enough magnetic field intensities. For example, Richmond
et al. compared a magnetic wrist strap with (1502–2365 gauss), a demagnetised
(<20 gauss) wrist strap, an attenuated (250–350 gauss) magnetic wrist strap, and a
copper bracelet. Their results show that wearing a magnetic wrist strap or a copper
bracelet did not appear to have any meaningful therapeutic effect, beyond that of a
placebo, for alleviating symptoms and combating disease activity in rheumatoid
arthritis (Richmond et al. 2013). For now we are not sure about the reason for this
lack of efficacy, however, as mentioned in Chap. 1, magnetic field parameters will
greatly influence the effects of SMF on biological samples. In addition, there are
multiple other factors that have led to the large variations in the clinical or research
work about the SMFs, which we will discuss more in Chap. 4 in this book. For
example, although lacking scientific mechanistic foundations so far, it is interesting
that there are multiple claims about the differential effects of the two different mag-
netic poles on human bodies (Table 2.2). In fact, there are two recent papers observed
differential effects of different magnetic field directions (De Luka et al. 2016;
Milovanovich et al. 2016). Although more research is strongly needed to confirm
their results, I think people should pay attention to the magnetic poles or directions
when they investigate the biological effects of magnet fields in the laboratory, or
simply want to try some magnetic therapy products.
The differential effects of the magnetic field direction and north/south poles need
to be further confirmed by more scientific researches, and ultimately to provide
clear scientific explanations. For now, I myself are not clear why two different poles
can make any differences because there is no physical difference between the North
and South pole of the magnet, at least from our current scientific knowledge.
However, it is possible that some unknown mechanism indeed exists to explain
these observations. Moreover, since it has already been shown that magnet could
levitate single cells when the magnetic field is upward to balance the gravity
(Durmus et al. 2015), it makes more sense to me if it is the magnetic field direction
that made the differences that people claimed. More interestingly, Durmus et al.
demonstrate that each cell type (i.e., cancer, blood, bacteria, and yeast) has a char-
acteristic levitation profile, and they have identified unique differences in levitation
and density blueprints between breast, esophageal, colorectal, and non-small cell

For now, it is not clear whether this is real. Different magnetic field direction could generate some
differences. However, although from the scientific point of view there is no explanation for this, I
do not exclude the possibility that their claim might be true. More scientific studies are encouraged
to explore this question
lung cancer cell lines, as well as heterogeneity within these seemingly homogenous
cell populations (Durmus et al. 2015). This indicates that various cell types in the
human body might respond totally differently to the magnetic fields. More researches
are needed to confirm this.
It is worth to mention that currently many researches related to magnetic therapy
as well as the biological effect studies about magnetic fields are not well described or
properly controlled. In 2008 and 2009, Colbert et al. wrote two important and com-
prehensive reviews (Colbert et al. 2008, 2009), which stated that “Complete descrip-
tions of the SMF dose that was applied to human participants are notably lacking in
the majority of SMF therapy studies published to date. Without knowing the SMF
dose that was delivered to the target tissue, we cannot draw meaningful inferences
from clinical trial results. As research on SMF therapy progresses, engineers, physi-
cists and clinicians need to continue to work together to optimize SMF dosage and
treatment parameters for each clinical condition. Future publication of SMF studies
should include an explicit assessment of the SMF dosage and treatment parameters
outlined in this review, so as to be able to replicate previous studies, validly assess
outcomes and make objective, scientific comparisons between studies.” The param-
eters they outlined include the magnet materials, magnet dimensions, pole configura-
tion, measure field strength, frequency of application, duration of application, site of
application, magnet support device, target tissue, distance from magnet surface,

Adapted from (Colbert et al. 2008). We recom-
mend that people should all follow these stan-
dards when reporting their results
which all have great potential to directly affect the outcomes (Colbert et al. 2008,
2009) (Table 2.3). Many related researches need replication and we hope we can
make great advancement after we have the proper knowledge of the magnetic field
and biological systems, which will not only be helpful for WHO to assess any pos-
sible health consequences, but also improve the current status of magnetic therapy,
which definitely needs much more rigorous experimentation. In fact, FDA has
already approved the use of TTF (tumor treating fields), which delivers low-intensity,
intermediate-frequency (100–300 kHz), alternating electric fields to treat newly
diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma, which works by disrupting cancer cell divi-
sion, with no significant damage to normal non-dividing cells (Kirson et al. 2004;
Pless and Weinberg 2011; Davies et al. 2013). Although TTF is a type of electromag-
netic field therapy using low-intensity electrical fields, not SMFs, it may shed light
on the SMF investigations for their potential clinical usage.
2.5 Magnetobiology and Biomagnetism
Generally speaking, magnetobiology is about the effects of magnetic fields on liv-
ing organisms, which is the focus of this book. In contrast, biomagnetism refers to
the magnetic fields that are generated by living organisms, which is not our main
focus in this book, but will be briefly discussed here.
As mentioned in the beginning of this chapter, the human body is mainly composed
of weak diamagnetic materials, such as water, proteins and lipids. However, our human
bodies also generate currents that produce small magnetic fields (Cohen et al. 1980).

Neurons in our brain, nerve cells, and muscle fibers are all excitable cells that can gen-
erate currents when they are activated. Magnetic fields produced by the human body
have been measured, which are actually very weak (10−10–10−5 gauss). Most of the
body’s fluctuating magnetic fields, such as those from the heart or the brain have been
extensively studied and developed. Electrocardiogram (ECG) measures the electrical
activity of the heart and electroencephalogram (EEG) measures the electrical activity
of the brain, both of which have been widely used in clinic.
It is well accepted that the human brain can be divided into multiple areas, and
each of them are responsible for different aspects of behaviour. The accurate and
efficient connectivity between these areas are critical for normal function of a healthy
brain. Although a single neuron could only produce very weak current, it can be
amplified when the neurons are clustered and aligned together and excited simultane-
ously. In this case, the neurons can produce magnetic fields that are strong enough to
be detected using superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs)
(Zimmerman et al. 1970; Hamalainen et al. 1993). Weak alternating magnetic fields
outside the human scalp, produced by alpha-rhythm currents, were demonstrated.
The fields near the scalp are about 1 × 10−9 gauss (peak to peak) (Cohen 1968).
Magnetoencephalography (MEG) (Fig. 2.5) is a non-invasive sophisticated tech-
nique that captures the magnetic fields generated by synchronized intraneuronal
electrical activity, which yields rich information on the spatial, spectral and temporal
signatures of human brain function. It is capable of imaging electrophysiological
brain activity with good (~5 mm) spatial resolution and excellent (~1 ms) temporal

resolution and provides significant value in elucidating the neural dynamics of the
human connectome in health and disease (O’Neill et al. 2015). There are many very
useful reviews and research articles for MEGs showing that neuroimaging methods
like MEG represents an outstanding approach to better understand the mechanisms
of both normal and abnormal brain functions (Brookes et al. 2011; He et al. 2011;
Pizzella et al. 2014; Kida et al. 2015; O’Neill et al. 2015; Pang and Snead 2016;
Stefan and Trinka 2016). Similarly, magnetocardiogram (MCG) measures the mag-
netic fields of the heart, which is a complementary or alternative tool for noninvasive
detection of coronary artery disease (Kandori et al. 2010; Wu et al. 2013).
In addition, MEG appears to be more sensitive than EEG and can provide addi-
tional and different information compared to EEG (Cohen 1972). MEG is not only
useful for functional neurosurgery but also for connectivity analyses. Since MEG
could offer additional insights not possible by MRI when used to study complex
network function, people are combining MEG (which has high temporal resolution)
with functional MRI (fMRI), which has high spatial resolution, to provide more
information on human brain function (Hall et al. 2014). In particular, MEG is most
widely applied to the study of epilepsy, a brain disorder that causes people to have
seizures (Kim et al. 2016; Pang and Snead 2016). In addition, simultaneous MEG/
EEG recording and analysis could provide complimentary information and better
detection sensitivity for tracing primary epileptic activity (Hunold et al. 2016;

--- Page 52 ---

Stefan and Trinka 2016). Moreover, for chronic neurological disorders such as epi-
lepsy, functional connectivity detected through hemodynamic (fMRI) and electro-
magnetic techniques (EEG/MEG) help to identify the interactions between epileptic
activity and physiological networks at different scales. fMRI and EEG/MEG func-
tional connectivity help in localizing important drivers of epileptic activity and can
also help in predicting postsurgical outcome (Pittau and Vulliemoz 2015). Beyond
the diagnosis benefit of MEG, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) (Fig. 2.6) is
another electromagnetic method that uses a “coil” placed near the head to stimulate
small regions of the brain and is used to diagnose or treat multiple diseases such as
stroke and depression. In fact, TMS is currently covered by some health insurance

2.6 Conclusion
Since human body itself is an electromagnetic object, it is not surprising that the
magnetic fields can produce some effects on us. However, the electrochemical pro-
cesses within the human bodies are very complicated and still remain incompletely
understood. Therefore the actual physical effects of magnetic fields on human bodies
will still need continuous efforts to achieve a complete understanding. In the mean-
time, magnetic therapy may be an alternative or complementary method in the clini-
cal use, especially in cases when conventional therapy options are unavailable. In
addition, whether the magnetic therapy works does not depend on our understanding
for its underlying biological mechanisms. As Dr. Basford said in his review (Basford
2001)“An electric or magnetic therapy is first discovered by the populace, resisted by
the medical establishment, and then discarded—only to arise again in the future in a
slightly different form. Although sophistication has increased, this pattern is likely to
continue into the future until clear treatment benefits and, one hopes, a convincing
mechanism of action are established.” Currently, what we should do is to try our best
to unravel the mysteries so that we can maximize the benefit we can get from these
nature powers. In the meantime, we should alert people that there are numerous unre-
liable websites or products about magnetic therapy. We believe that with the increas-
ing efforts to use legitimate and scientifically backed methods in the field of magnetic
field research, we will gain more mechanistic insights to facilitate the clinical appli-
cation of SMFs and make magnetic therapy scientifically respectable.

Molecular Mechanisms for Electromagnetic
Field Biosensing
Abstract Almost all types of life that have been investigated appropriately have
shown some indication of biological response to magnetic fields. An alluring appli-
cation of the information that already has been, and continues to be, collected
describing how biological systems sense magnetic fields and transduce this infor-
mation into physiological response is to treat human disease. Towards that goal, this
chapter summarizes what has been learned about electromagnetic biosensing in a
diverse set of organisms across several phyla and discusses how the underlying
mechanisms apply (and in some cases, don’t apply) to humans.
Keywords Static magnetic fields (SMFs) • Biological magnetoreceptors • Magnetic
field biosensing • Magnetite • Crytochromes • Chemical magnetosensing
3.1 Introduction
This chapter explores the biological basis for therapeutic effects of electomagentic
fields (EMFs), with a focus on static magnetic fields (SMFs; basic definitions of
magnetism are briefly reviewed in Sect. 3.2 of this chapter) in people. At present
there is no clear and widely accepted mechanism by which SMFs benefits human
health; indeed, there is considerable skepticism in the mainstream media (as well as
in certain parts of the scientific literature) that SMFs have any effect at all. For
example, a purported lack of beneficial effects sometimes is deduced from studies
that EMFs (in general) have negligible detrimental effects. To illustrate, the bulk of
the evidence indicates that living under (or near) high voltage electrical power lines
does not increase the risk of cancer (Ahlbom et al. 2001; Anonymous 2002; Schüz
2011). To some, this lack of harm implies that EMF exposure (of any kind) likely
has no beneficial effect either.
On the other hand, it is well established that a wide range of living organisms –
ranging from bacteria, mollusks, crustaceans to fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and
mammals (Wiltschko and Wiltschko 2012) – use the earth’s relatively weak mag-
netic field (i.e., geomagnetism) for orientation, navigation and direction finding as
well as for additional purposes briefly covered in Sect. 3.3 of this chapter (with
more detailed descriptions given in Chaps. 2 and 4 of this book). As will become

52 3 Molecular Mechanisms for Electromagnetic Field Biosensing
evidence from this information, certain mechanisms that some species use for mag-
netoreception are highly specialized and do not apply directly to humans. In other
cases, however, the underlying molecular basis of magnetic sensing and the broad
mechanisms involved across many phyla provide at least a conceptual basis for how
human cells, tissues, and organs can respond to SMFs. If nothing else, precedent
from non-mammalian systems provides a starting point for investigation of mag-
netic field sensing in humans; one example lies in ongoing efforts to establish the
presence and activity of magnetite – which was first described in prokaryotes half a
century ago – in people (magnetite is discussed in Sect. 3.4 – along with other
known magnetosensing mechanisms found in nature – and throughout this chapter
as an exemplar of a “well known” magnetic biosensor).
Although much has been learned about how magnetoreception occurs, many
aspects of magnetic field biosensing remain poorly understood and in some cases
basic mechanisms may remain undiscovered. This is particularly likely to be the
case for humans, where the very topic of whether people have any ability to sense
magnetic fields, much less respond to them, remains controversial (as covered in
more detail in Chap. 7). Here, in Sect. 3.5 an overview of sensing mechanisms
found elsewhere in nature may apply to humans along with speculation of “novel”
ways that human cells, tissues, and organs can sense and respond to magnetic fields.
3.2 Magnetism, Basic Definitions
This section briefly introduces basic concepts and definitions of magnetism related
to biological systems; a more detailed description of magnetic phenomena is pro-
vided in Chap. 1 of this book (or introductory physics textbooks or fairly reliable
internet sources such as Wikipedia). The information presented here is intended
primarily to provide a sufficient basis for understanding the subsequent sections of
this chapter without the need to refer to outside material.
3.2.1 Ferromagnetism, Paramagnetism, and Diamagnetism
Ferromagnetism is “everyday” magnetism; for example, permanent magnets (such
as ubiquitous refrigerator magnets) or removable car bumper stickers are ferromag-
netic. A ferromagnetic substance becomes magnetized when exposed to a magnetic
field and retains this feature “permanently” after removal from the field. As a caveat,
magnetism is not permanent in the strict sense of the word because field strength
often wanes over time, and can be affected (i.e., field direction can be reversed) by
exposure to a subsequently-applied field; nevertheless, field strengths of ferromag-
nets can be remarkably stable over long periods of time. As a second nuance,
although the term “ferro” implicitly suggests that ferromagnets contain iron, several
other metals have ferromagnetic properties including most alloys of nickel and

--- Page 60 ---

3.2 M agnetism, Basic Definitions 53
cobalt as well as several rare earth metals (neodymium is a well known example). A
final feature, important for biological magnetosensing, is that these metals are not
inherently magnetic but must have higher degrees of organization. For example,
iron in solution or in prevalent biological contexts (e.g., when it is complexed with
hemoglobin in erythrocytes) is not ferromagnetic. Instead the metal atoms (in the
case of iron, usually as iron oxides) must be organized into distinct crystalline struc-
tures to be ferromagnetic; such structures occur abundantly in the form of lodestone
(iron ore) in the mineral world and, in specialized situations in the biological realm,
as magnetite.
Paramagnetic substances “become magnetic” while exposed to a magnetic field
but this effect rapidly decays upon loss of the field. Examples of paramagnetic sub-
stances include free electrons found in metals and unpaired electrons found in many
biological molecules. Indeed, in biology, many proteins are complexed with metals
that have unpaired electrons, leading to the development of the commonly-used
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy (Bertini et al. 2012).
Diamagnetism is a property of all materials that describes the formation of an
induced magnetic field in the direction opposite to an externally applied field; in
other words the induced field attempts to repel the applied field (note that this is
opposite to paramagnetism where the induced field is attracted to, and aligns with,
the external field). Molecules found in biological systems ranging from water to
bioorganic macromolecules are typically only very weakly diamagnetic and any
resulting diagmagnetism can be overshadowed by external fields or by surrounding
paramagnetic or ferromagnetic entities.
3.2.2 Field Types and Strengths
Life evolved in the presence of the Earth’s magnetic field (i.e., “geomagnetism”);
the geomagnetic field (GMF) fluctuates in direction and strength over time and
space and currently has a magnitude at the Earth’s surface that ranges from 25 to 65
microteslas (μT; or 0.25 to 0.65 gauss [1 T equals 10,000 guass]). This field is con-
sidered to be “weak” insofar as it cannot be detected by humans during their every-
day activities in meaningful or noticeable ways without specialized instruments. To
provide context for magnetic field strengths, the human brain emits a much weaker
magnetic field (~0.1–1 picoT) while cardiac pacemakers produce fields about an
order of magnitude stronger than GMFs (~500 μT); a refrigerator magnetic is yet
another order of magnitude stronger (~5 mT); a device custom-built to treat cultured
human cells (Fig. 3.1) provides another ~2 order jump in field strength (~0.25 T);
another order of magnitude increase in strength (to ~1 to 3 T) represents typical
stereo loudspeaker fields as well as MRI exposure; and finally, a 17 T field repre-
sents the strength needed to famously levitate a frog (see Chap. 1). For the purposes
of this Chapter’s discussion, magnetic fields in the range of geomagnetism are
termed “weak.” For higher strength fields, fields below 1 T are considered
to be “moderate” strength and those above 1 T are considered to be “strong”

Fig. 3.1 Device used to treat cells with “therapeutic” strength SMFs. (a) The device is shown
inside a standard-sized cell culture incubator with the position of permanent neodymium alloy
magnets (inside a layer of aluminum covering) shown in Panel (b), which also indicates an approx-
imate representation of the GMF (based on the positioning of the incubator in Baltimore, Maryland,
USA) with the thin gray arrows and the applied SMFs (colored lines). (c) A top view of the “inset”
(as indicated on Panel a) shows the dimensions and relative field strength at various positions on a
standard 24-well cell culture plate located in one of the two centered (from top to bottom) slots
indicated in the “front view” of the inset shown in Panel (d). Panel (d) also shows the position of
the neodymium magnets and how field strength (measured at “cell level”, indicated in dark red,
orange indicates cell culture media) varies based on the vertical distance from the magnets. When
used for biological studies, only the four centered (from top to bottom) positions were typically
used (the bottom plate remained empty) resulting in cells typically being exposed to SMF strengths
ranging from 0.23 to 0.28 T (Wang et al. 2009, 2010)
(most therapeutic magnetic treatments fall in the moderate strength category).
Finally, although many electromagnetic fields (EMFs) involve a time varying com-
ponent this chapter primarily focus on time invariant, i.e., “static” magnetic fields
(which, as mentioned, are called “SMFs”); other EMF modalities used for human
therapy are outlined briefly in Chap. 7). In the literature, it is sometimes assumed

--- Page 62 ---

3.3 Overview of Magnetoreception in Various Organisms 55
that EMFs with frequencies of less than 100 Hz have biological effects similar or
even identical to SMFs (Markov 2014), but unless otherwise noted, that convention
is not followed in this discussion (i.e., unless otherwise stated, SMFs that are men-
tioned have no time-varying component).
3.3 Overview of Magnetoreception in Various Organisms
The ability to sense magnetic fields – or “magnetoreception” – has evolved across
almost all phyla of mobile organisms starting with ancient magnetotactic bacteria
that exploit the GMF to move up or down in the water column and nematodes that
also use magnetic fields to move vertically (but on land). Other animals such as but-
terflies, birds, and even mammals use the Earth’s magnetic field for navigation dur-
ing long distance migrations. A sampling of such magnetosensing organisms is
provided below, along with brief mechanistic insights. This information is not
intended to be comprehensive (a more detailed description is provided in Chap. 5 of
this book) but is instead meant to provide an overview of known and postulated
molecular mechanisms found throughout nature as a prelude to a more detailed
description of the three “well known” modes of magnetic sensing (magnetite, chem-
ical, and inductive) in Sect. 3.4 of this chapter.
3.3.1 Bacteria
Magnetotactic bacteria were first described by Salvatore Bellini in a monograph
published in 1963 (Bellini 1963) with a seminal peer-reviewed report by Robert
Blakemore published 12 years later (Blakemore 1975) with a detailed review in the
Annual Review of Microbiology published in 1982 (Blakemore 1982). These bac-
teria contain “permanent” magnets in the form of nano-sized (e.g., of an average
size of ~420 Å) cuboidal to octahedral iron grains that allow them to orient them-
selves with the geomagnetic (0.25 to 0.65 gauss) or applied magnetic fields. Upon
orientation, which is entirely passive in nature (e.g., even dead magnetotactic bacte-
ria become aligned with an applied magnetic field), living bacteria actively swim
along the field in a predominantly northward direction for bacteria harvested from
the Northern Hemisphere and in a southward direction for bacteria from the
Southern Hemisphere (Blakemore 1982). After half a century, investigation of mag-
netotactic bacteria remains robust with ever-increasing understanding of the inte-
gration of the iron grains into higher order structures such as “magnetosomes;”
insights into the biosynthetic machinery for these structures; and insights into the
dynamic control of these microorganism’s iron-processing physiology in changing
environments (Araujo et al. 2016). Although not directly related to human health or
magnetic therapy in people, magnetotactic bacteria nicely illustrate how even very

--- Page 63 ---

56 3 Molecular Mechanisms for Electromagnetic Field Biosensing
“primitive” organisms have the ability to exploit magnetic sensing to enhance sur-
vival and gain an evolutionary advantage over competing species.
3.3.2 Invertebrates
As just described, even single celled organisms such as magnetotactic bacteria have
a remarkable ability to exploit magnetoreception-based sensing for directional
movement; we next turn to more complex creatures to illustrate how a diversity of
life forms – using added biochemical strategies – have the ability to sense and
respond to magnetic fields.
3.3.2.1 Nematodes
The soil-dwelling nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans is extremely well stud-
ied in a laboratory setting and constitutes a facile model for investigation of “sim-
ple” multicellular organisms; for example all of this creature’s neurons are mapped
allowing for exquisitely sensitive investigation of brain function (at least to the
extent that C. elegans have functioning brains) at the molecular and genetic levels.
To complement and extend laboratory study of these nematodes, a recent paper by
Vidal-Gadea and coauthors reported fascinating magnetoreception in “wild” C.
elegans where populations isolated from different sites across the globe migrated at
angles to an applied magnetic field that optimized vertical translation in their native
soil, with northern- and southern-hemisphere worms displaying opposite migratory
preferences (Vidal-Gadea et al. 2015). In these experiments, magnetotaxis was
traced to genes expressed in the AFD pair of neurons that previously had been
implicated in thermosensation (Mori 1999). The specific genes involved in mag-
netotaxis in these cells include two independent mutant alleles of ttx-1, important
for AFD differentiation; the triple mutant lacking guanylyl cyclases, gcy-23, gcy-8,
and gcy-18, which together are critical for AFD function; and two independent
mutant alleles of each tax-4 and tax-2 genes that encode subunits of a cGMP-gated
ion channel implicated in transduction of stimuli in sensory neurons (Vidal-Gadea
et al. 2015).
3.3.2.2 Mollusks and Crustaceans
It has been know for three decades that the marine mollusk Tritonia diomedea has
an ability for geomagnetic orientation (Lohmann and Willows 1987), that similar to
nematodes, has been traced to specific neurons. In a series of studies beginning in
the late 1980s, Lohmann and Willows first reported that perturbation of geomagnetic-
strength magnetic fields change electrical activity in a single neuron (left pedal 5,
LPd5) (Lohmann et al. 1991); subsequent experiments identified four such neurons

--- Page 64 ---

3.3 Overview of Magnetoreception in Various Organisms 57
including LPd5 but also RPd5, LPd6 and RPd6 (Wang et al. 2004). These neurons
fired an increased number of action potentials when the horizontal component of the
ambient magnetic field was rotated. This response disappeared when all nerves
emerging from the brain were cut, suggesting a peripheral locus for the geomag-
netic transducer (Popescu and Willows 1999) leading to speculation that magnetic
biosensors that affect brain function (in general) “could be in the big toe, or any-
where” (Hand 2016).
In addition to mollusks, crustaceans constitute another prominent category of sea
creatures that respond to GMFs as exemplified by the spiny lobster (Lohmann and
Ernst 2014). As Lohmann and Ersnt explain, spiny lobsters have a magnetic com-
pass of the polarity type, similar to salmon and mole rats, that determines north
using the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field (another type of magnetic
compass found in nature is the inclination compass used by birds and sea turtles that
defines “poleward” as the direction where the angle between the magnetic field vec-
tor and gravity vector is the smallest (Lohmann and Ernst 2014)). To date, similar to
mollusks where the geomagnetic transducer is thought to exist outside of the brain
per se and nematodes (where the actual molecular-level biosensor remains
unknown), magnetoreceptors in crustaceans have yet to be identified definitively.
One possibility is that magnetite nanoparticles ~50 nm in diameter similar to those
found in magnetotactic bacteria act as the receptors. Evidence in support of this idea
includes higher than background levels of magnetic material in shrimp and barna-
cles that respond to geomagnetism; significantly, these species experience disorien-
tation upon demagnetization of these putative magnetite-based receptors (Buskirk
and O’Brien 2013) and can also have their preferred orientation deflected by re-
magnetization of the putative magnetite particles in a different direction (Lohmann
and Ernst 2014).
Besides magnetite, a biosensing option in water-dwelling organisms is electro-
magnetic induction (as discussed in more detail in Sect. 3.4.3 below), which occurs
when electrically conductive material moves through a magnetic field in any direc-
tion not parallel to the field (seawater is particularly conducive for transmission of
electrical currents). As a result, positively and negatively charged particles move to
the opposite sides of the object resulting in a voltage that depends on the velocity of
the object relative to the magnetic field (Lohmann and Ernst 2014). Finally, as dis-
cussed in Sect. 3.4.2, chemical magnetoreceptors exist in many types of animals but
have yet to be investigated in crustaceans (Lohmann and Ernst 2014).
3.3.2.3 Insects
The crustaceans just mentioned are arthropods, a phylum shared with insects; con-
sequently it is not surprising that insects also provide numerous examples of mag-
netoreceptoin and magnetotaxis including ants (de Oliveira et al. 2010) and bees.
Magnetoreception has been particularly well-studied in bees – no doubt because of
their agricultural importance as pollinators; this role critically depends on their
direction-finding ability and their innate compass, which allows them to find and

--- Page 65 ---

58 3 Molecular Mechanisms for Electromagnetic Field Biosensing
“remember” the location of food sources over distances up to five kilometers away.
An early study showed that bees have magnetic remanance consistent with the pres-
ence of magnetite (Gould et al. 1978); subsequent electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR) imaging of honeybees showed magnetite was primarily located in the insects’
abdomens (El-Jaick et al. 2001).
Despite decades of study, the precise mechanism of magnetoreception in bees
remains controversial. For example, recent study of bumblebees showed that iron-
based granules exhibiting magnetic character were not only located in their bodies
(i.e., abdomens) as found in honeybees but were also abundant at peripheral sites on
their wings and heads, thereby providing new models for how magnetite-based
direction finding could work in these insects (Jandacka et al. 2015). Emerging evi-
dence suggests that honeybees may have a dual sensing system that includes photo-
chemical reactions (Válková and Vácha 2012). A recent study downplayed this
complementary mechanism, based on experiments that showed honeybee magneto-
reception worked in the total dark, where the requisite initiating photochemical
reactions could not take place (Liang et al. 2016) (the radical pairs mechanism dis-
cussed in detail in Sect. 3.4.2, below explains the requirement for light for “chemi-
cal” magnetoreception). Support for dual-sensor magnetoreception in insects is
provided by vertebrates – in particular several species of birds – that appear to rely
on both magnetite and chemical magnetoreception for direction finding and migra-
tion over very long distances. Another possibility is that bees have both types of
sensors that work independently with chemical magnetosensing acting as a “back
up” mechanism (Dovey et al. 2013).
3.3.3 Vertebrates
3.3.3.1 Overview
The discussion up to now covered several “ancient” organisms that often have
unique biological abilities that do not carry over to more advanced phyla such as
vertebrates (for example, although magnetite appears in many types of more
advanced animals, the specialized arrangement of the iron crystals into magneto-
somes observed in bacteria has not been found above the prokaryotic level). It is
clear, however, that magnetoreception is found in many higher organisms including
vertebrates and, at least in some cases, detection of the magnetic fields rely on non-
magnetite based biosensors. For example, several types of fish – exemplified by
sharks – have specialized electrical sensing organs that are thought to also provide
magnetoreception through induction, as discussed in Sect. 3.4.3. Other species,
such as salmon, use magnetic fields for navigation over the vast distances they travel
both in the open ocean and for returning to the precise site of their birth to procreate,
which requires the correct choice between multiple river junctions as they move
upstream. In addition, many amphibians and reptiles have the ability to detect and
magnetic fields (Chap. 5). While fascinating, these examples will not be described

--- Page 66 ---

3.3 Overview of Magnetoreception in Various Organisms 59
further here, instead we will briefly cover birds (Sect. 3.3.3.2), where chemical
magnetoreception (Sect. 3.4.2) has become well established and then to mammals
(Sect. 3.3.3.3) that share many biological similarities with humans and thus provide
a reasonable scientific foundation to explain how magnetic fields can influence bio-
logical responses and work therapeutically in people.
3.3.3.2 Birds
Magnetoreception has been described in many birds – and indeed may be ubiqui-
tous across the avian world – including remarkable examples such as the Arctic Tern
that literally navigates from one end of the globe to the other. Although traveling
shorter distances, the homing pigeon exemplifies precision direction finding ability
that uses magnetic cues; in particular, a pigeon’s homing ability in part is derived
from magnetite-based receptors in the beak. These magnetoreceptors, however,
only record magnetic intensity and as such, are just one component of a bird’s multi-
factorial navigation mapping ability (Wiltschko and Wiltschko 2013). Increasingly
compelling evidence suggests that birds, reminiscent of bees where a dual sensing
system for GMFs has been proposed, use both magnetite and photoreceptors. The
light sensing ability of birds has been linked to cryptochrome proteins, whose
underlying chemistry is described in more detail in Sect. 3.4.2 below. Briefly here,
these proteins have long been known to participate in circadian rhythms when
located in the nuclei of certain retinal cells. Recently Bolte and coworkers discov-
ered forms of cryptochrome (Cry1a and Cry1b) in the cytosol of retinal cells in
migratory birds (e.g., European robins and homing pigeons) that depend on both
light and magnetic fields for direction finding (Bolte et al. 2016). The unique cyto-
solic localization of these crytoptochromes suggests that they are not involved in
circadian rhythms; instead their non-nuclear localization implicates their involve-
ment in photosensing-based magnetoreception.
3.3.3.3 Mammals
The elucidation of magnetoreceception in mammals has lagged other types of
organisms, such as bacteria and birds for which much is now known even though
mysteries remain. Nevertheless a fairly recent of magnetic field sensing in mam-
mals (published in 2014 [(Begall et al. 2014)]), shows that many intriguing – albeit
often preliminary and so-far inconclusive – pieces of evidence are available that
together make the case that human’s closest evolutionary relatives do respond to
magnetic fields in several ways. In particular, magnetoreception studies have sug-
gested that mammals can utilize GMFs for homing and direction finding; the focus
on this “obvious” endpoint can be explained by researchers who were seeking to
reproduce magnetotactic abilities already widely documented across many phyla.
Briefly, these studies showed that cetaceans can migrate thousands of kilometers
based on magnetic cues; rodents displaced hundreds of meters (or more) from their

--- Page 67 ---

60 3 Molecular Mechanisms for Electromagnetic Field Biosensing
homes can return successfully based on what the best evidence suggests is magnetic
homing; bats preferentially build nests aligned to magnetic fields and have similar
roosting preferences; and finally cattle, sheep, and deer – and even dogs – preferen-
tially (for reasons otherwise unclear) align their bodies along N-S magnetic axes
(Begall et al. 2014).
Indications are emerging that mammals can exploit geomagnetism for reasons
beyond direction finding and homing. For example, the success of red foxes in hunt-
ing mice is correlated with the alignment of the direction of jumping attacks with
GMFs when the fox’s vision is obscured by snow or high vegetation (Červený et al.
2011). Relevant to the ultimate objective of this chapter and book – which is the
evaluation of magnetic field therapy in humans – mice (presumably when safe from
being hunted from red foxes) experience changes in stress-induced analgesia (the
inability to feel pain) dependent on SMF exposure (Betancur et al. 1994). Subsequent
studies showed that shielding of the ambient magnetic fields (to produce hypomag-
netic fields or “HMFs”) reduces stress-induced analgesia in these rodents (Choleris
et al. 2002; Prato et al. 2005). These and other similar studies have established that
exposure (or lack of exposure) to weak magnetic fields can affect mammalian biol-
ogy in biomedically-relevant ways. In particular, these studies provide a foundation
for the idea that magnetic therapy is viable in mammals even at low field strengths,
and as discussed below (and in Chap. 7 of this book), these effects can in theory be
complemented, augmented, and amplified by using stronger field strengths avail-
able in clinical settings using specialized treatment devices.
3.4 Types of Biological Magnetoreceptors
The overview of magnetoreception provided above in Sect. 3.3 highlighted two
major molecular-level mechanisms underlying magnetic field detection across sev-
eral classes of diverse organisms. The first, and most prevalent, is the exploitation of
magnetite across many types of life for direction finding and additional biological
responses (magnetite is discussed further in Sect. 3.4.1). Evidence is also consoli-
dating behind a second modality for magnetoreception – with the important caveat
that a full understanding of how any animal perceives magnetic fields has not yet
been attained (Lohmann and Ernst 2014) – is the radical pairs mechanism (RPM)
used in chemical magnetoreception. Biological iterations of the RPM widely use
crytochrome proteins that are putatively utlized by organisms ranging from bumble-
bees to birds as part of their magnetic compass and even to mice where pain sensing
was found more than 20 years ago to be modulated by both light and magnetic field
exposure (Betancur et al. 1994). Cryptochromes and other chemistry-based possi-
bilities for magnetoreception are discussed further in Sect. 3.4.2. Finally, a third
more specialized mode of magnetic field detection, which is electrical induction, is
covered in Sect. 3.4.3.

3.4 Types of Biological Magnetoreceptors 61
3.4.1 Magnetite
3.4.1.1 Structure and Biosynthesis in Prokaryotes
Magnetite can be considered to be the original biological magnetoreceptor. The
“original” designation is based both on evolutionary history with magnetite present
in early-evolving lifeforms (e.g., bacteria and unicellular algae) (Lefèvre and
Bazylinski 2013) and also because it was the first magnetic biosensor discovered
and characterized by modern science (it has been linked to behavioral responses in
living organisms for half a century or more (Bellini 1963; Blakemore 1975)).
Magnetite is common in the abiotic mineral world, comprising a major source of
iron ore; chemically, magnetite is cystalline iron oxide (Fe O) that is ferromagnetic
3 4
when in crystal form and therefore becomes a permanent magnet itself after expo-
sure to an applied magnetic field. In bacteria, individual magnetite particle sizes can
range from 35 to 120 nm with a particle size distribution much narrower than pos-
sible using chemical synthetic methods (Kahani and Yagini 2014); the size range of
prokaryote-made magnetite is consistent with single-domain crystals that can be as
small as 20 nm or as large as 100 nm (Mirabello et al. 2016). In magnetotactic bac-
teria, individual magnetite crystals are arranged into “magnetosomes,” which are
aggregates (usually linear chains) of ~20 magnetite crystals aligned along the long
axis of the cell. Each magnetite crystal is surrounded by a membrane and is con-
nected to the cell wall through cytoskeletal filaments (Mirabello et al. 2016).
Magnetosome biosynthesis in prokaryotes, which involves the formation of these
unique mineralized organelles, is increasingly being unraveled and is now known to
require many genes that initiate nucleation and participate in the growth of the crys-
tals (Arakaki et al. 2008; Lower and Bazylinski 2013; Mirabello et al. 2016; Murat
et al. 2010).
3.4.1.2 Distribution and Function in Higher Organisms
Including Humans
Magnetite has been discovered and studied across many species; it has now been
detected in crustaceans, insects, birds, salmon, sea turtles, and other animals (even
mammals such as cattle) that can orient themselves with respect to the Earth’s mag-
netic field. Although controversial, magnetite has been reported to exist in the
human brain (Kirschvink et al. 1992) as well as in the heart, spleen and liver
(Schultheiss-Grassi et al. 1999). Magnetite isolated from higher animals typically
exists as single-domain crystals similar to those found as chains in magnetosomes
in magnetotactic bacteria (Johnsen and Lohmann 2008). The origin and source of
magnetite in higher organisms such as people remains unclear, however, because
counterparts to biosynthetic genes in bacteria (Mms5, Mms6, Mms7(MamD),
Mms13(MamC), MamF, ManG, and MmsF (Mirabello et al. 2016)) do not seem to

--- Page 69 ---

62 3 Molecular Mechanisms for Electromagnetic Field Biosensing
be present and spontaneous chemical crystallization of magnetite results in larger
size distributions than found in nature (Kahani and Yagini 2014).
Mechanistically, there are several ways that magnetite crystals have been postu-
lated to transduce geomagnetic field information to the nervous system (or other
organ systems) by Lohman and Ernst (Lohmann and Ernst 2014). These mecha-
nisms are guided by lessons learned from magnetosomes bacteria, where each mag-
netite crystal is surrounded by a membrane and this larger structure is connected to
the cell wall through cytoskeletal filaments providing a biochemical mechanism for
force transduction (Mirabello et al. 2016). In particular, when the crystalline mag-
netite nanoparticles attempt to rotate to align with the GMF or other external field,
torque would be transmitted from the magnetosome via the cytoskeleton. In higher
organisms, if a similar system were in place, force could be transduced through a
similar mechanism to secondary receptors (such as stretch receptors, hair cells, or
mechanoreceptors); another possibility is that the rotation of intracellular magnetite
crystals might directly (or indirectly) open ion channels (Cadiou and McNaughton
2010).
Indirect evidence for physical connections between magnetite and the cytoskel-
eton comes from the aforementioned studies where shrimp and barnacles, that expe-
rience disorientation upon demagnetization of these putative magnetite-based
receptors (Buskirk and O’Brien 2013), can have their preferred orientation deflected
by re-magnetization of the putative magnetite particles in a different direction
(Lohmann and Ernst 2014). If magnetite crystals could freely rotate, they would
quickly adopt random orientations inconsistent with these effects, which require all
(or at least some) of the magnetite in the organism’s body remain aligned in a cer-
tain way. Accordingly, magnetite presumably must be tethered to larger biomacro-
molecules, such as the cytoskeleton (which plays a dual role in both immobilizing
the magnetite crystals and transducing force when the nanoparticles attempt to
rotate to maintain alignment with the GMF or other magnetic field). Figure 3.2 con-
ceptually illustrates the tethering of magnetite to the cytoskeleton and force trans-
duction to membrane components while Cadiou and McNaughton present a detailed
description of how this type of force transduction hypothetically functions in
eukaryotic cells (Cadiou and McNaughton 2010).
3.4.2 Chemical Magnetosensing
3.4.2.1 Background: The Chemical Basis of the Radical Pair
Mechanism (RPM)
Chemical reactions that proceed through radical intermediates can be influenced by
magnetic field effects (MFEs) that alter reaction rate, yield, or product distribution
(Rodgers 2009); the “radical pair mechanism” (RPM) underlies these effects. An
RPM-influenced reaction begins when a ground-state precursor species (e.g., “A
and B”) are excited to produce two singlet radicals i.e., a spin-correlated radical pair

--- Page 70 ---

3.4 Types of Biological Magnetoreceptors 63
Fig. 3.2 Conceptualization of magnetite-based force transduction. (Top) An ion channel in the
“open” conformation is shown along with connections to an intracellular magnetite particle via
unstretched filaments; under these conditions the magnetic field of the magnetite is aligned with an
externally-applied field. (Bottom) Upon misalignment of the magnetite and the external field, the
magnetite turns in an attempt to re-align with the external field resulting in the generation of torque
that can stretch the filaments and in the process, transduce force to membrane elements (in this
depiction, the ion channel becomes distorted and subsequently experiences changes in activity)
(RP); the singlet RP electrons can undergo a spin-selective reaction to produce the
singlet product (Fig. 3.3). However if coherent evolution of the spin state converts
singlet RPs to triplet RPs on a similar (or faster) time scales as singlet product for-
mation, the triplet product can be formed resulting in either different reaction kinet-
ics or product composition for the chemical reaction.
The role of magnetism comes into play when S → T (singlet to triplet) conver-
sion and the reverse T → S conversion of the spin-correlated RP are driven by mag-
netic interactions. Remarkably, even a weak applied magnetic field that has a much
smaller effect on the reactants than factors such as thermal motion at physiological
temperature can profoundly influence product formation in an RPM reaction. A

Fig. 3.3 Diagram outlining the radical pair mechanism (RPM). A spin-coupled radical pair is
generated (by photoactivation in magnetoreception) resulting in a donor molecule (D) transferring
an electron to an acceptor molecule (A). An external magnetic field affects interconversion between
singlet (S) and triplet states (T) of the radical pair; typically the presence of an applied field
increases the transient abundance of the triplet state resulting in more rapid production of triplet
products (i.e., k compared to k increases upon application of an external force, or in the case of
2 1
GMF sensing, appropriate alignment of the field with the reacting spin-coupled radical pair)
(Adapted from Ritz et al. (2000), Rodgers (2009), and Wikipedia)
simplifying analogy provided by Rodgers to describe the influence of an external
magnetic field is to consider a train approaching a railway switch (Rodgers 2009).
The train is being propelled by a locomotive, which requires considerable energy,
but the final destination (i.e., the composition of the reaction products) and time it
takes to reach it (i.e., the reaction kinetics) completely depend on the expenditure of
a small amount of energy (e.g., an amount that can be provided by a single person
in a few seconds of effort) to change a junction switch in the track from one route to
another destination. This relatively tiny force is equivalent to the role that magnetic
fields – even weak GMFs – can play in determining the outcome of RPM
reactions.
3.4.2.2 The RPM in Magnetic Field Biosensing
Based on the above explanation, RPM reactions provide a second biological trans-
ducer for weak SMFs (after magnetite) such as GMFs. The proposed mechanism
requires the production of initiating free radical intermediates; in purely chemical
systems appropriate radical-inducing catalysts could be introduced into the system
for this purpose. In biological systems where such catalysts do not play a role, the
production of the initiating radical pair (RP) is generally believed to require the
absorption of a photon (i.e., from visible light). Accordingly, the receptors involved
in such sensing need to be located on, or within a few hundreds of microns, of the
surface of an organism where ambient light could penetrate. Most logically, these

--- Page 72 ---

3.4 Types of Biological Magnetoreceptors 65
receptors would be located in the eye, which is already optimized for photosensing;
based on this reasoning, leading candidates for magnetoreception are cryptochrome
proteins. Ritz and coauthors outlined how cryptochromes could function magneto-
reception in the year 2000 (Ritz et al. 2000); this group described how, upon expo-
sure to blue light, these proteins transfer an electron to flavin adenine dinucleotide
(FAD) resulting in both the protein and the flavonoid having unpaired electrons –
i.e., the “radical pair” required for an RPM reaction. It should be noted that the exact
RPM reactants remain ambiguous; it is generally thought that in addition to the
flavin, the other radical pair is one of three tryptophan residues on the cryptochrome
protein although it has been speculated recently that the other reactant might be
ascorbic acid rather than one of the suspected tryptophans (Lee et al. 2014).
Nevertheless, an RPM reaction “activates” cryptochome proteins for chemical mag-
netosensing, often in conjunction with magnetite-based mechanisms as discussed
above.
Cryptochrome reactions depend on continuous photoexcitation (Kattnig et al.
2016), explaining the requirement for both light and the presence of a magnetic
field – i.e., the “dual sensing” mechanisms mentioned above for bees, birds, and
mice. Because the spins of the two unpaired electrons are correlated with each other
and subject to the surrounding magnetic field (e.g., the relative orientation with the
geomagnetic or to an induced field) in an RPM reaction, the presence, absence, rela-
tive strength, and orientation of the magnetic field affects the length of time crypto-
chrome remains activated (Ritz et al. 2000). In turn, activation of cryptochrome
affects the light-sensitivity of retinal neurons, with the overall result that a bird (or
a bee) can see the color phase shift caused by the magnetic field (Ritz et al. 2000).
In practice, the dependence of dual sensing mechanisms on continuous photoexcita-
tion can be used empirically to deconvolute magnetosensing behavior; for example
bees are known to have the biochemical machinery for RPM magnetoreception but
their ability to utilize their magnetic compass in the total dark indicates that mag-
netic direction finding ability can function solely via a magnetite mechanism (Liang
et al. 2016).
3.4.3 Electromagnetic Induction
3.4.3.1 Biological Precedent for Induction: The Ampullae of Lorenzini
Sharks, stingrays and certain cartilaginous fish have electroreceptive organs known
as ampullae of Lorenzini that can detect changes to electric potential; these special-
ized structures allow these sea creatures detect direct (DC) electric currents in water
and help sense the weak electric fields of prey and predators (Murray 1960). The
ampullae of Lorenzini also allow sharks (and other animals with these physiological
structures) to detect even very weak magnetic fields (Meyer et al. 2005). This ability

--- Page 73 ---

66 3 Molecular Mechanisms for Electromagnetic Field Biosensing
results from the phenomenon where the movement of electrically conductive mate-
rial through a magnetic field in any direction other than parallel to the field lines
results in the migration of positively and negatively charged particles migrate to
opposite sides of the object (Roth 2012). As a result, a voltage is generated that
depends on the velocity of the object’s motion relative to the magnetic field. From a
physics perspective, this phenomenon is known as the “Hall effect” that states that
a magnetic field exerts force on a moving ionic current and as a result, a magnetic
field perpendicular to the flow of an electric current will exert force to deflect and
separate the charged ions. Presumably, specialized biological systems are then able
to detect, and respond to, this mismatch in electrical charge potential as the host
organism moves through misaligned SMFs.
3.4.3.2 The “Hall Effect” – Relevance Beyond Specialized
Electroreceptive Organs?
The Hall effect has been – at least on the internet – used to explain the effects of
magnetic fields in biological settings in some clearly misguided ways. For example,
one claim is that electrons (being regarded as “charged particles”) orbiting the
nucleus of an atom (i.e., they are presumed to be moving in space) are propelled to
higher velocities, thereby enhancing chemical reactivity. (In reality, applied mag-
netic fields only influence chemical reactivity through electron spin effects via the
specialized RPM reactions described above in Sect. 3.4.2). Another common mis-
conception is that the Hall effect can be used to explain changes to blood flow
observed upon magnetic field exposure. While it is true that blood does contain
copious amounts of charged (e.g., sodium and chloride ions) and paramagnetic
(e.g., hemoglobin in certain oxidation states) entities, the physical forces generated
by the Hall effect are dwarfed (they are generally orders of magnitude smaller) than
kinetic energy associated with blood flow (which is generated through the mechani-
cal action of the heart) not to mention thermal motion of biomolecules at body
temperature. As a result, the idea that electromagnetic induction plays a role (out-
side of specialized ampullae of Lorenzini) in transducing magnetic field exposure
into biological response is often met with disbelief.
3.5 Mechanisms for SMF Effects on Human Biology
Now that we have outlined biosensors found in the natural biological world for
magnetoreception, we will revisit each of them in the context of human biology and
provide a synopsis whether they plausibly play a role in magnetotherapy. As will be
described in Sect. 3.5.1, the established magnetosensors do not provide a satisfying
explanation for responses observed in humans, spurring speculation in Sect. 3.5.2
about “other” possibilities.

--- Page 74 ---

3.5 Mechanisms for SMF Effects on Human Biology 67
3.5.1 “Established” Biosensors/Magnetoreceptors
3.5.1.1 Magnetite
Over the past 30 years there have been periodic reports of magnetic iron (i.e., mag-
netite) in the human body with some of these studies being debunked because of
possible contamination (Hand 2016); for context many of these studies came from
the same era when aluminum “contamination” from cooking utensils and containers
was (in retrospect implausibly) linked to plaques associated with Alzheimer’s dis-
ease (Savory et al. 1996). Other reports of magnetite in humans, however, have
remained plausible. One such study was published in the Proceedings of the National
Academy (USA) that reported detailed parameters about magnetite-like iron assem-
blages in the human brain (Kirschvink et al. 1992). These crystal structures resem-
bled magnetite from magnetotactic bacteria and fish and were present at minimum
levels of five million single-domain crystals per gram for most types of brain tis-
sues. Certain regions of the brain (e.g., pia- and dura-derived samples) had ~20-fold
higher levels; further, the magnetite occurred in clumps of 50–100 crystals. The
magnetite nanoparticles distributed (or, based on the numbers outlined in the next
section, a better description might be “sparsely scattered”) through neuronal and
astroglial membranes have been proposed to play roles in perception, transduction
and storage of information that arrives to the neocortex (Banaclocha et al. 2010).
To provide context for these findings, one gram of brain tissue has roughly one
billion cells. Accordingly, if the magnetite clumps were intracellular, only about one
in 500 to one in 20,000 cells – depending on the exact size of the clumps and which
part of the brain was under analysis – could contain a magnetite clump. If the clumps
were extracellular (which is not consistent with the proposed role of magnetitie-
based force/signal transduction in eukaryotic cells, as outlined in Fig. 3.2 and by
Cadiou and McNaughton (Cadiou and McNaughton 2010)), additional cells could
be directly impacted by, or interact with, the magnetite. Either way based on the
reported amount of magnetite, only a relatively fraction of brain cells could be
involved in magnetoreception through a magnetite-based mechanism.
Another comparison is that honeybees have approximately 108 magnetite crys-
tals in their bodies (Kirschvink and Gould 1981); based on a mass of ~100 mg a bee
has ~109 (one billion) copies of magnetite per gram or about 200-fold more on a
mass basis. While it is at least theoretically plausible that only a minor subset of
neural cells might be involved in magnotosening in humans, the search for these
cells constitutes a veritable “needle in the haystack” scenario and in the 25 years
since this PNAS report was published (Kirschvink et al. 1992), magnetoreception
via magnetite in the human brain remains unproven. Showing remarkable persis-
tence, however, the lead author of the PNAS study, Joe Kirschvink, has continued to
pursue the possibility of magnetic sensing in the human brain and was recently
featured in a Science (the magazine) news article describing how he and his col-
leagues are embarking on the next generation of studies to pursue the elusive goal

of obtaining “definitive” proof for magnetotherapy or other magnetic field effects in
humans (Hand 2016).
3.5.1.2 Chemical Magnetoreception via Cryptochromes
As just mentioned, efforts to confirm that magnetoreception exists in humans con-
tinue with exciting new initiatives being planned (Hand 2016). It should be noted
that in addition to the decades old hypothesis that the human brain (and other tissue)
contains magnetite, humans may have a dual sensing system similar to bees, birds,
and mice based on cryptochromes. Two complementary lines of evidence support
this idea. First, geomagnetic fields can influence the light sensitivity of the human
visual system (Thoss et al. 2000; Thoss et al. 2002), evoking cryptochrome-based
systems found in other species. Second, a biochemical foundation for this hypoth-
esis is falling into place. In particular, humans express two cryptochromes (hCRY1
and hCRY2) in their eyes showing that – at least in theory – have the biochemical
machinery for chemical magnetoreception (up to now, these proteins have primarily
been linked to circadian rhythms). Foley and coworkers performed a critical experi-
ment in support of this hypothesis by taking a transgenic cross-species approach to
show that hCRY2, which is heavily expressed in the retina, can function as a mag-
netic field sensor in the magnetoreception system of Drosophila in a light- dependent
manner (Foley et al. 2011). Although this result showed that hCRY2 has the molec-
ular capability to function as a light-sensitive magnetosensor, it must be emphasized
that even though hCRY proteins can function in magnetosensing roles as-of-yet
there is no firm evidence that they actually perform this way in humans or even in
other mammals such as dogs and apes that also exhibit certain GMF-sensing abili-
ties and (perhaps entirely coincidentally) express cryptochromes in the retina
(Nießner et al. 2016).
3.5.1.3 Induction: Revisiting the Effects of SMFs on Red Blood Cells
The idea that magnetic fields can influence blood flow and cardiovascular circula-
tion is pervasive. As mentioned earlier, an often mentioned but fallacious scientific
basis for this premise is that an applied magnetic field has inductive effects on iron-
laden red blood cells (RBCs) that influence the overall circulation of the blood. On
one hand, this idea is reasonable considering that RBCs typically constitute 40% or
more of the volume of blood and if magnetic field-associated induction really was
in play, the overall circulation of the blood easily could be affected but any inductive
force (or, the “Hall effect”) is too weak to measurably affect blood constituents.
Secondly, there is considerable confusion and misinformation that iron in RBCs is
“magnetic.” Clearly it is not ferromagnetic because it is not organized in crystalline
“magnetite” form; this iron, however, can be paramagnetic, which has long been
recognized to have at least diagnostic value, but not without many nuances and
caveats. For example, a paper from 1961 titled “Problems in the Measurement of

--- Page 76 ---

3.5 Mechanisms for SMF Effects on Human Biology 69
Blood Flow by Magnetic Induction” (Wyatt 1961) reported technical issues that
bedeviled (at that time) already 20 year old efforts to exploit the electromagnetic
fields generated by movement of paramagnetic iron found in RBCs to measure
blood circulation.
In the intervening years, the study of iron in RBCs under the influence of magnetic
fields has become increasingly sophisticated, for example a 2003 publication by
Zborowski and coauthors (Zborowski et al. 2003) outlined the magnetophoretic mobil-
ity of different populations of deoxy and oxygenated erythrocytes (i.e., RBCs). This
study showed that with the development of a new technology, cell tracking velocime-
try, it was possible to measure the migration velocity of deoxygenated and metHb-
containing erythrocytes exposed to a magnetic field of 1.4 T (i.e., a MRI-s trength field).
In this study erythrocytes with 100% deoxygenated hemoglobin had a magnetopho-
retic mobility of 3.86 × 10−6 mm3 s/kg compared to 3.66 × 10−6 mm3 s/kg for erythro-
cytes containing 100% metHb; in other words, both of these forms of hemoglobin
displayed paramagnetic properties. By comparison, oxygenated erythrocytes had mag-
netophoretic mobilities ranging from −0.2 × 10−6 mm3 s/kg to +0.30 × 10−6 mm3 s/kg,
indicating that these cells were primarily diamagnetic (Zborowski et al. 2003). The
detection and analysis of these properties have matured since 2003, allowing dielectro-
phoretic and magnetophoretic methods to now be used for diagnosis of medical condi-
tions such as malaria parasite-infected red blood cells (Kasetsirikul et al. 2016).
Although RBCs can now be studied and indeed, be used for diagnostic medical
tests, by exploiting their magnetic properties it is less clear that externally applied
magnetic fields have legitimate therapeutic effects on blood circulation, as is often
claimed by vendors of “magnetic therapy” products (e.g., see Chap. 7). In particular,
the impact of applied magnetic fields on unpaired electrons in contexts other than
RPM reactions (as discussed above) is negligible under weak (i.e., geomagnetic
strength) fields and even strong (i.e., 1.3 to 3 T MRI-strength fields) have negligible
“chemical” effects. The lack of any such clear effect is evidenced in rather lax regu-
latory oversight by agencies including the United States FDA, which allows “well-
ness” magnetic field devices to be marketed to “treat” almost any type of ailment
because safety is not an issue (Anonymous 2015). As a caveat, the word “treat” in
the previous sentence is not completely accurate in a medical sense because the
FDA specifically prohibits claims of therapeutic efficacy against any particular dis-
ease condition for magnetic field generating devices.
3.5.2 “Other” Human Biosensors
3.5.2.1 Human Cells Appear to Have Additional Magnetosensing
Capacity
Evidence exists that humans can respond to magnetic fields; for example geomag-
netic fields influence the geomagnetic field on the sensitivity of our eyes (Thoss and
Bartsch 2007). This evidence remains controversial because (apart from unscientific

--- Page 77 ---

70 3 Molecular Mechanisms for Electromagnetic Field Biosensing
internet claims) a lack of clear evidence exists to explain how the three “canonical”
modes of magnetoreception (magnetite, chemical magnetosensing, and induction)
function in humans. In particular, even the first two modes required for visual geo-
magnetic perception in other species remain largely mysterious in humans. In part,
progress is slow because many experiments performed with lower species (e.g.,
dissection of brains in living nematodes to uncover specific neurons involved in
magnetorecption) cannot be performed in humans. In a way, ethical (commonsense,
really) considerations that prevent such experimentation in humans have been a
blessing in disguise, forcing researchers to use cell lines a surrogates for in vivo
testing. These studies have led to the discovery of responses to magnetic fields at the
cell level that do not involve any of the three “established” modes of magnetorecep-
tion. For example, immobilized cells maintained in the dark in incubators with
unchanging SMFs are not expected to exhibit chemical magnetosensensing (because
they’re kept in the dark) or induction (because they do not move); similarly, there is
no plausible mechanism for the presence of magnetite in these cells. To briefly illus-
trate this point, we next mention both an outside example based on HMF exposure
(Sect. 3.5.2.1) and work from this author’s lab using moderate strength SMFs (Sect.
3.5.2.2).
3.5.2.2 HMF Effects on Cell Behavior Are Mediated by the Cytoskeleton
Recently, Mo and coauthors found that HMFs repress expressions of genes associ-
ated with cell migration and cytoskeleton assembly in human neuroblastoma cells
grown in cell culture conditions that were not plausibly subject to any of the mag-
netite, chemical magnetoreception, or induction mechanisms (Mo et al. 2016).
Going beyond analysis of gene expression, they showed that HMF modulated
“whole cell” behaviors in SH-SY5Y cells including control of cell morphology,
adhesion and motility and traced these changes to the actin cytoskeleton. This study
suggested that the elimination of geomagnetic field affects the assembly of the
motility-related actin cytoskeleton, and implicates F-actin as a target of HMF expo-
sure and positions it as a potential novel mediator of GMF sensation (Mo et al.
2016).
3.5.2.3 SMF Effects on Lipid Membranes and Downstream Signaling
The author’s laboratory has published two studies that implicate biological mem-
branes as the “biosensor” for magnetic fields in the apparent absence of canoni-
cal chemical (i.e., crytochrome-mediated) mechanisms. These studies were
based on literature reports that SMFs alter the biophysical properties of lipids
(Braganza et al. 1984) and by extension, higher order structures such as lipid
bilayers (De Nicola et al. 2006; Nuccitelli et al. 2006; Rosen 2003b). Based on these
studies, we postulated that biological membranes were the most reasonable “bio-
sensor” for magnetoreception in cell culture investigations where magnetite was

--- Page 78 ---

3.5 Mechanisms for SMF Effects on Human Biology 71
absence and the cells involved had no obvious light-sensing ability. Further,
based on the threshold of ~0.2 T reportedly required for SMFs to have an impact
on biological membranes (Braganza et al. 1984), we undertook two studies where
cells were treated with 0.23–0.28 T SMFs (the variation is due to different place-
ment of tissue culture plates in the incubator device, see Fig. 3.1).
In one study, in part spurred by clinical efforts to use ~0.3 T SMFs to treat
Parkinson’s disease ((PD), as discussed in more detail in Chap. 7), we monitored the
impact of similar magnetic fields on the adenosine A receptor (A R) in the PC12
2A 2A
rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cell line that displays metabolic features of PD. We
found that SMF reproduced several responses elicited by ZM241385, a selective
A R antagonist, including altered calcium flux, increased ATP levels, reduced
2A
cAMP levels, reduced nitric oxide production, reduced p44/42 MAPK phosphoryla-
tion, inhibited proliferation, and reduced iron uptake (Wang et al. 2010) (as shown
in more detail in Chap. 4). Biological responses to ZM241385 result from direct
binding to A R. By contrast, SMF – not being a conventional small molecule phar-
2A
macological agent – must elicit cellular responses through a fundamentally different
mode of action. A plausible mechanism, outlined in cartoon form in Fig. 3.4, is that
~0.25 SMF exposure directly alters the biophysical properties of lipid bilayers,
which in turn rapidly modulates ion channel activity (Rosen 2003a) and thereby
perturbs the intra-and extracellular levels of Ca2+ levels (Wang et al. 2010; Wang
et al. 2009).
3.5.2.4 Lipid Membrane-Based Mechanisms Can (Speculatively) Account
for Biphasic Kinetic Responses to Constant Magnetic Field
Exposure
In a separate study, human embryoid body-derived (hEBD) LVEC cells were treated
with the ~0.25 T fields for time periods of 15, 30, and 60 min, 2, 4 and 8 h, and
finally up to 7 days (Wang et al. 2009). Software analysis of gene expression
obtained by Affymetrix mRNA profiling of these cells showed that nine signaling
networks responded to SMF; of these, detailed biochemical validation was per-
formed for the network linked to the inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6). We
found a biphasic response to SMF exposure (Fig. 3.5) where short-term (<4 h) acti-
vation of IL-6 mRNA expression occurred with coordinated up-regulation of toll-
like receptor-4 (TLR4) and ST3GAL5, phosphorylation of p38, and calcium efflux.
Interestingly, the initial multifaceted up-regulation of IL-6 mRNA was already
being attenuated by 24 h but actual production of secreted IL-6 did not peak until
day 2 after which it dropped to sub-steady levels by day 4.
A biochemical mechanism – outlined in Fig. 3.6 – for the biphasic kinetic
response that puzzlingly occurs in the constant presence of a steady SMF, can be
postulated based on the increased expression of NEU3 and the decreased expression
ST3GAL5 at early time points. These enzymes work together to reduce levels of
cell surface-displayed sialic acid including that found on ganglioside GM3.
Specifically, NEU3 is a sialidase that removes the sialic acid from GM3, thereby

--- Page 79 ---

72 3 Molecular Mechanisms for Electromagnetic Field Biosensing
Fig. 3.4 Proposed mechanism for direct effects of SMF on biological membranes. (a) Based
on literature reports of SMF effects on lipids (Braganza et al. 1984), we propose that field strengths
of >0.2 T impose superdiagmagnetic organization on lipid bilayers. (b) Extending this concept to
biological membranes (i.e., lipid bilayers with embedded proteins such as the cartoon of an ion
channel as shown), we found that calcium ion flux rapidly responds to ~0.25 T fields (Wang et al.
2010; Wang et al. 2009). This response can be explained by allosteric regulation of ion channel
activity by the relative membrane organization and biophysical properties in presence and absence
of the external SMF. This response is conceptually similar to a variation of the magnetite-based
mechanism shown in Fig. 3.2 where ion channel activity is not modulated by direct action on the
channel (as shown in that figure) but instead results from magnetite’s action on cis elements in a
membrane that – upon perturbing membrane structure or organization – have an effect on proxi-
mally located ion channels (This mechanism is described in detail elsewhere (Cadiou and
McNaughton 2010))
generating LacCer; at the same time loss of the biosynthetic enzyme ST3GAL5
prevent regeneration of GM3 (as well as other gangliosides such as GM1). The net
effect of this functionally-coordinated response is diminution of cell surface levels
of GM3, which we previously showed can affect cell surface signaling (Wang et al.
2006) and others have shown affect that gangliosides modulate calcium ion activity
(Carlson et al. 1994). Accordingly, we speculate that SMF exposure immediately
affects calcium ion channel activity through changes to the bulk biophysical proper-
ties of the surrounding membranes. This sets in motion a series of events that ulti-
mately counteract the impact of SMF. In other words, the initial stimuli presented

Fig. 3.6 Proposed mechanism for biphasic response to constant SMF exposure. (a) This pro-
posal builds on the mechanism shown in Fig. 3.4 with the added provision that SMF exposure
alone cannot fully convert low (or inactive) ion channels to a highly active form. Instead, the added
contribution of ganglioside GM3 is required; for context GM3 is a prominent constituent of lipid
rafts that surround membrane proteins and modulate their activity (this concept is explained in
detail in Hakomori’s “glycosynapse” publications (Hakomori 2002; Hakomori 2004a; Hakomori
2004b; Mitsuzuka et al. 2005; Toledo et al. 2004)). As a consequence, over the initial period of
SMF treatment (e.g., Days 0 to 3), SMF exposure and GM3’s impact combine to convert ion chan-
nels from a low to high activity state. During this time, however (as shown in Fig. 3.5), changes to
the expression of NEU3 and ST3GAL5 lead to a later onset reduction in GM3 abundance (as
shown in Panel b); in particular, GM3 becomes depleted after 2–3 days of SMF exposure when the
newly made NEU3 becomes active. As proposed in the far right section of Panel a, SMF alone (i.e.,
in the absence of GM3) is not sufficient to maintain lipid conformation or biophysical properties
to support “highly active” ion channel flux. (b) Biochemical details of NEU3 (a sialidase that
removes sialic acid from gangliosided) and ST3GAL5 (the sialyltransferase that converts LacCer
to GM3) are shown. The increase activity NEU3 converts GM3 to LacCer, which cannot be replen-
ished at normal rates because of the concomitant decrease in ST3GAL3
by SMF exposure is counteracted by longer-term (also SMF-induced) loss of GM3
(i.e., GM3 ultimately proves to be a stronger mediator of the responses studied than
SMF), which ultimately attenuates and in fact reverses IL-6 production over longer
exposure periods.
3.5.2.5 Lipid Membranes as a Magnetic Field Biosensor – Revisiting
Earlier Evidence
In addition to the speculative mechanism just presented, we briefly revisit magnetic
sensing in nematodes (Sect. 3.3.2.1), where specific neurons have been identified to
be responsive to the GMF. Early studies, consistent with findings in mollusks and

crustaceans Sect. 3.3.2.2), suggested that the actual biosensor was peripheral to the
neurons found to respond to magnetic fields. A more recent study, however, pro-
vides convincing evidence that the neurons themselves have magnetic sensing abil-
ity of activated calcium flux and activation in the absence of synaptic input
(Vidal-Gadea et al. 2015). This information is consistent with our cell-based find-
ings where SMF exposure of human neural-like cells appeared to directly interact
with membranes to trigger down-stream response. A counterpoint to this hypothe-
sis, however, is that the nematode study monitored GMF-strength magnetic fields,
which are much weaker than the ~0.2 T fields previously described as necessary for
direct “magnetic field sensing” by changes to the biophysical properties of mem-
branes; indeed, although not described in the recent (year 2015) study, nematodes
have been reported to contain biogenetic magnetite (Cranfield et al. 2004). To con-
clude, membranes – in and of themselves – may provide added modes of magnetic
field biosensing not detected up to now; like many aspects of “magnetobiology”
confirmation of this possibility provides exciting future research opportunities.
3.6 Concluding Comments
This chapter revisits, albeit briefly, magnetic field biosensing abilities found across
many diverse organisms and attempts to apply the information that has been com-
piled over the past half century or so to prospects for “magnetotherapy” in humans
(this concept is extended in Chap. 7). As covered above, “Nature” has evolved two
well-established modes of magnetoreception (magnetite and cryptochrome RPM
mechanisms) and the more specialized inductive mechanism exemplified by certain
fish that have “ampullae of Lorenzini” sensing organs. As summarized in Sect. 3.5,
these mechanisms do not provide a fully compelling explanation for effects of mag-
netic field exposure in human cells, resulting in speculative models (in part based on
this author’s previous research) where moderate strength SMFs directly modulate
the biophysical properties of biological membranes with profound consequences on
downstream signaling pathways, gene expression, and ultimately cell fate.

Chapter 4
Impact of Static Magnetic Fields (SMFs)
on Cells
Abstract This chapter contains two parts. The first one is about parameters that
influence the cellular effects of static magnetic fields (SMFs), including magnetic
field intensity, cell types, cell densities as well as other cellular factors. The second
part is about the various commonly seen cellular effects of SMFs, including cell
orientation, proliferation, microtubule and cell division, actin, viability, attachment/
adhesion, morphology, migration, membrane, cell cycle, chromosome and DNA,
reactive oxygen species (ROS), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as well as calcium.
The focus of this chapter is on current evidence of SMFs on human cells and some
animal cells, and especially on the potential factors that contributed to the different
observations in individually reported studies.

4.1 Introduction
Just like temperature and pressure, magnetic field is an important physical parame-
ter that could have a general impact on multiple objects. The effect of magnetic field
on object is mainly dependent on the magnetic susceptibility of the object, the mag-
netic field intensity and gradient. As discussed in Chap. 3, cells are filled with vari-
ous cellular contents and biomolecules that could respond to the magnetic field,
such as cell membrane, mitochondria, DNA and some proteins. For example, it has
been shown that the peptide bonds united into organized structures, such as α-helix,
which confers proteins diamagnetic anisotropy (Pauling 1979) (Fig. 4.1a–c).
Organized polymers, such as microtubules that are composed of well organized
tubulin (Fig. 4.1d), are also demonstrated to have strong diamagnetic anisotropy and
could be aligned in the presence of magnetic fields (Vassilev et al. 1982; Bras et al.
1998, 2014). Both of them have been discussed in a recent review (Fig. 4.1)
(Albuquerque et al. 2016). Obviously, the effects of magnetic fields on biological
samples such as a human cell are not restricted to just a few components. In a recent
work by Zablotskii et al., the theoretical calculation was provided to explain the
effect of high gradient magnetic fields (HGMFs), which belong to SMFs because

the field intensity does not change over time but are inhomogeneous in space, on
biological samples (Fig. 4.2) (Zablotskii et al. 2016). Since different cellular com-
ponents have differential magnetic susceptibility, the exact cellular effects of a given
SMF on a specific cell need to be examined specifically.
Multiple cellular components and molecules can be affected by SMFs, which
was already discussed in Chap. 3. In fact, it has been found that even the dissolved
oxygen in water could be modulated by high SMFs (Ueno and Harada 1982; Ueno
et al. 1994, 1995). The effects of SMFs on cells have been reviewed and discussed
previously (Adair 2000; Dini and Abbro 2005; Miyakoshi 2005; Miyakoshi 2006;
Ueno 2012), which covered most related literature up to 2012. The recent review by
Albuquerque et al. covered many progresses that people made in the past decades
about the influence of SMFs on cells (Albuquerque et al. 2016). Here in this chapter,
the focus is considerably different. I will try to provide an overview for the current
evidence of SMFs on human cells and some animal cells, and especially will focus
on the differential cellular effects reported in previous studies as well as their
potential causes. Plants, bacteria and other organisms will not be discussed in this
chapter, but in Chap. 5.

4.2 Parameters That Influence the Cellular Effects of SMFs
In Chap. 1, we briefly mentioned that cellular effects of SMFs are dependent on
multiple factors, which directly affect the experimental outcomes. Therefore it is
not surprising that although there are numerous in vitro and in vivo experiments
reporting the effects of magnetic field on biological systems, experimental coher-
ence among them is still lacking. However, the seemingly inconsistent observations
are mostly due to the different magnetic field parameters and experimental vari-
ables, such as magnetic field treatment time and magnetic field intensity, etc. It is
obvious that different types of magnetic fields (static or dynamic, pulsed or noise),
as well as magnetic fields with various intensities (weak, moderate or strong) or
frequencies (extremely low frequency, low frequency or radiofrequency) can all
lead to diverse and sometimes completely opposite results (Jia et al. 2007; Simko
2007; Sun et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2015). In addition, there are also many cellular
factors and experimental setup parameters that can have a direct influence on the
experimental outcomes, which will be discussed in detail below.

4.2.1 Magnetic Field Intensity-Dependent Cellular Effects
of SMFs
The magnetic fields with different intensities could generate differential cellular effects
and multiple studies showed that magnetic fields with higher intensities could generate
stronger phenotypes. For example, erythrocytes (red blood cells, RBCs) could be
aligned by SMFs with their disk planes parallel to the magnetic field direction and the
orientation degree was dependent on SMF intensity (Higashi et al. 1993). Specifically,
1 T SMF had only detectable alignment effect on erythrocytes while 4 T high SMF
induced almost 100% alignment (Higashi et al. 1993). Moreover, Prina-Mello et al.
reported that the p-JNK level was increased in rat cortical neuron cells after exposure
to 2 T and 5 T SMFs but not the weaker SMFs of 0.1–1 T (Prina-Mello et al. 2006). In
addition, our lab recently showed that the human nasopharyngeal cancer CNE-2Z cell
and human colon cancer HCT116 cell proliferation could be inhibited by SMFs in a
magnetic field intensity dependent manner (Zhang et al. 2016) (Fig. 4.3). Specifically,
1 T SMF exposure for 3 days reduced CNE-2Z and HCT116 cell number by ~15% and
9 T SMF for 3 days reduced their cell number by over 30%. In contrast, 0.05 T SMF
did not have significant effects on these two cells (Zhang et al. 2016) (Fig. 4.3).

4.2 P arameters That Influence the Cellular Effects of SMFs 85
Although in many cases, higher magnetic field intensities can generate stronger
effects than in lower field intensities, there are also evidences showing that different
magnetic field intensities could cause completely different effects. For example, In
2006 Prina-Mello et al. showed that p-ERK was increased when rat cortical neuron
cells were exposed to 0.75 T SMF but not 0.1 T, 0.5 T, 1 T, 2 T, or 5 T SMFs (Prina-
Mello et al. 2006). In fact, 2 T SMF could reduce p-ERK level, which was opposite
to the effect of 0.75 T (Prina-Mello et al. 2006). Ghibelli et al. also showed that
although 6 mT SMF had an anti-apoptotic activity, 1 T SMF had a potentiating
effect on small molecule induced apoptotic effects (Ghibelli et al. 2006). In 2014,
the Shang group compared the effect of hypomagnetic field of 500 nt, moderate
SMF of 0.2 T and high SMF of 16 T for their effects on mineral elements in
MC3T3-E1 cells (Zhang et al. 2014b). They found that both hypo and moderate
magnetic fields reduced osteoblast differentiation but the 16 T high magnetic field
increased osteoblast differentiation. In addition, hypomagnetic field did not affect
mineral elements levels but moderate magnetic field increased iron content and high
magnetic field increased all mineral elements except copper (Zhang et al. 2014b).
Therefore different magnetic field intensity could induce completely different
effects at various biological systems. As Ghibelli et al. mentioned in their paper, the
lack of a direct intensity-response curve may explain the existence of so many con-
tradictory reports in the literature (Ghibelli et al. 2006). The exact effects of a given
magnetic field on a specific cellular effect need to be examined case by case. More
examples of SMF intensity induced cellular effects can be found in Chap. 1.
4.2.2 Cell Type-Dependent Cellular Effects of SMFs
Besides the various parameters of the magnetic fields, different cells in individual
studies often have distinct genetic background, which makes them respond to the
magnetic fields differentially. For example, as early as in 1992, Short et al. showed
that a 4.7 T SMF could alter the ability of human malignant melanoma cells attach-
ment onto the tissue culture plate, but had no effect on normal human fibroblasts
(Short et al. 1992). In 1999 and 2003, Pacini et al. found that a 0.2 T SMF induced
obvious morphology change in human neuronal FNC-B4 cell and human skin fibro-
blast cells but did not affect mouse leukemia or human breast carcinoma cells
(Pacini et al. 1999a, 2003). In 2004, Ogiue-Ikeda and Ueno compared three differ-
ent cell lines for their orientation changes under an 8 T SMF for 60 h exposure. They
found that while the smooth muscle A7r5 cells and human glioma GI-1 cells could
be aligned along the field direction of the 8 T SMF, the human kidney HFK293 cells
were not aligned (Ogiue-Ikeda and Ueno 2004). In 2010, the high magnetic field of
16 T did not cause obvious changes in unicellular yeast (Anton-Leberre et al. 2010)
but could induce frog egg division alteration (Denegre et al. 1998). In 2011, Sullivan
et al. showed that moderate intensity (35–120 mT) SMF could affect attachment and
growth of human fibroblast cells as well as growth of human melanoma cells,
but not attachment or growth of adult adipose stem cells (Sullivan et al. 2011).

4.2 P arameters That Influence the Cellular Effects of SMFs 87
In 2013, Vergallo et al. show that inhomogeneous SMF (476 mT) exposure caused
toxic effects on lymphocytes but not on macrophages (Vergallo et al. 2013). These
studies all show that different cell types respond to SMFs differently.
The different cellular effects of SMFs on various cell types may because these
cells were originated from different tissues. Since different tissues have totally dis-
tinct biological functions and genetic background, it is not surprising that they have
different responses to SMF exposure. However, evidences show that even for cells
from the same tissue, their response to the same SMF can be very different. For
example, the Shang group has made series of progresses about the impact of SMFs
on different types of bone cells. For example, they not only found that the differen-
tiation and mineral elements can be differentially affected by low, moderate and
high SMFs (Zhang et al. 2014b) but also found that different types of bone cells
have obviously different cellular responses. The Shang group compared the effects
of 500 nt, 0.2 T and 16 T SMFs on osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells (Zhang et al. 2014b)
and osteoclast differentiation from pre-osteoclast Raw264.7 cells (Zhang et al.
2017a). They found that both hypo and moderate SMFs reduced osteoblast differen-
tiation but promoted osteoclast differentiation, formation and resorption. In con-
trast, 16 T high SMF increased osteoblast differentiation and inhibited osteoclast
differentiation. Therefore the osteoblast and osteoclast cells responded totally oppo-
site to these SMFs. Their studies revealed some parameters that could be used as a
physical therapy for various bone disorders. They also summarized the effects of
SMFs on bone in a very informative review (Zhang et al. 2014a).
It is interesting that many studies indicate that SMFs could have inhibitory
effects on cancer cells but not non-cancer cells. For example, Aldinucci et al. found
that 4.75 T SMF significantly inhibited Jurkat leukemia cell proliferation but did not
affect normal lymphomonocytes (Aldinucci et al. 2003b). Rayman et al. show that
growth of a few cancer cell lines can be inhibited by 7 T SMF (Raylman et al. 1996),
but a few other studies showed that even 10–13 T strong SMFs did not induce obvi-
ous changes in non-cancer cells such as CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells or
human fibroblast cells (Nakahara et al. 2002; Zhao et al. 2010). These results indi-
cate that cell type is a very important factor that contributes to the differential
responses of cells to SMFs. Recently we found that epidermal growth factor recep-
tor (EGFR) and its downstream pathway play key roles in the SMF-induced cell
proliferation inhibition. Our results showed that although CHO cells did not respond
to moderate (1 T) or strong (9 T) SMFs, the transfected EGFR, but not the kinase-
dead mutant of EGFR, could convert the SMF-insensitive CHO cells into SMF-
sensitive cells and their cell growth could be inhibited by moderate and strong SMFs
(Fig. 4.4). Detailed mechanisms will be discussed in Chap. 6, which focuses on the
potential application of SMFs in cancer treatment.

88 4 Impact of Static Magnetic Fields (SMFs) on Cells
Most individual studies so far have only investigated one or very few types of
cells, which is not sufficient enough for people to comprehensively understand the
effects of the magnetic fields on cells. Therefore, comparing different cell types
side-by-side for their responses to the magnetic fields is strongly needed. In our
recent work, we compared 15 different kinds of cells, including human cells and
some rodent cells for their responses to 1 T SMF. Our results confirmed that SMFs
could induce completely opposite effects in different cell types (Zhang et al. 2017b).
However, since the biological systems are very complicated, the knowledge we
have is still very limited. More studies are definitely needed for people to get a more
complete understanding for the effects of SMFs on different types of cells.
4.2.3 Cell Density-Dependent Cellular Effects of SMFs
We recently found that the cell density also played very important roles in SMF-
induced cellular effects. We originally found this by accident, when we were investi-
gating the effects of 1 T SMF on human CNE-2Z nasopharyngeal cancer cell
proliferation. We got diverse results when we plated the cells at different cell densities
(Zhang et al. 2015). To verify this observation, we seeded CNE-2Z cells at 4 different
cell densities and examined them side-by-side. We found that at lower cell density, 1
T SMF treatment for 2 days did not inhibit CNE-2Z cell proliferation and there was
even a tendency of increased cell number after SMF treatment. However, when the
cells were seeded at higher densities, it was interesting that 1 T SMF could consis-
tently inhibit CNE-2Z cell proliferation (Zhang et al. 2017b). These results demon-
strate that cell density can directly influence the effect of 1 T SMF on CNE-2Z cells.
We suspected that the cell density-induced variations must at least partly contribute
to the lack of consistencies in the literature. Most researchers in the field of biological
studies of magnetic fields, including us, did not really pay enough attention to the cell
density, or at least did not realize that the cell density could cause dramatic variations
in the experimental outcomes. However, it has been shown that cell density could
directly cause variations in cell growth rate, protein expression, as well as alterations
in some signaling pathways (Macieira 1967; Holley et al. 1977; Mcclain and Edelman
1980; Takahashi et al. 1996; Caceres-Cortes et al. 1999, 2001; Baba et al. 2001; Swat
et al. 2009). Then we chose 6 other human cancer cell lines, including colon cancer
HCT116, skin cancer A431, lung cancer A549, breast cancer MCF7, prostate cancer
PC3 and bladder cancer EJ1 cells. We found that for most of these solid cancer cell
lines, their cell number could be reduced by 1 T SMF when they were seeded at higher
densities, but not at lower densities (Fig. 4.5). This indicates that cell density could
generally influence the impact of SMFs on human cancer cell lines.
Then we further tested a few other non-cancer cell lines and found that cell den-
sity could directly influence the effects of SMFs on their proliferation as well. In
addition, the pattern is different in different kinds of cells (Zhang et al. 2017b).
Although the mechanism is still not completely understood, our data revealed that
EGFR and its downstream pathways might contribute to the cell type- and cell

density-i nduced variations (Zhang et al. 2017b). However, since cell density can
have multiple effects on cells, such as calcium level (Carson et al. 1990) and signal-
ing pathways, other factors are likely to be involved. For example, in 2004, Ogiue-
Ikeda and Ueno found that A7r5 cells (smooth muscle cells, spindle shaped) and
GI-1 cells (human glioma cells, spindle shaped) could orient in an 8 T SMF. However,
it was interesting that the orientation did not occur when the cells were under the
confluent condition at the start point of the magnetic field exposure, when the cell
density was too high. They concluded that the magnetic field affected the cell
division process, and only the proliferating cells at high density were oriented under
the magnetic field (Ogiue-Ikeda and Ueno 2004). Apparently, further analysis is
needed to unravel the complete mechanisms of cell density-dependent variations in
SMF- induced cellular effects. However, before we have a clear understanding of the
molecular mechanisms, people should always pay extra attention to the cell density
in their own studies, as well as in literature reading.

4.2.4 Cell Status Influences the Cellular Effects of SMFs
Besides the cell type and density, cell status can also affect the cellular effects of
SMFs. For example, in RBCs, the hemoglobin conditions can directly affect the
magnetic properties of the whole cell. In normal RBCs, the hemoglobin is oxygen-
ated and the cell is diamagnetic. In fact, they are slightly more diamagnetic than
water because of the diamagnetic contribution of globin. However, when the cells
were treated with isotonic sodium dithionite to make the haemoglobin in deoxygen-
ated reduced state or treated with sodium nitrite to oxidize the haemoglobin (methe-
moglobin), the RBCs would become paramagnetic. Back in 1975, Melville et al.
directly separated RBCs from whole blood using a 1.75 T SMF (Melville et al.
1975). In 1978 Owen used a 3.3 T SMF with high gradient to seperate RBCs (Owen
1978). The paramagnetic methemoglobin containing RBCs could be separated from
diamagnetic untreated RBCs as well as diamagnetic leukocytes (white blood cells,
WBCs) (Owen 1978). In fact, “magnetophoresis” has been applied in RBC, called
RBC magnetophoresis, which uses an applied magnetic field to characterize and
separate the cells based on the intrinsic and extrinsic magnetic properties of biologi-
cal macromolecules in these cells (Zborowski et al. 2003; Moore et al. 2013). In
2013, Moore et al. designed an open gradient magnetic RBC sorter and tested on
label-free cell mixtures (Moore et al. 2013). They showed that in the open gradient
magnetic RBC sorter, the oxygenated RBCs were pushed away from the magnet
and the deoxygenated RBCs were attracted to the magnet. Moreover, the effect for
the oxygenated RBC’s was very weak and comparable to that of other non-RBC
cells in the blood, which do not contain hemoglobin and could be considered as
non-magnetic. They proposed that the quantitative measurements of RBC mobility
in cell suspension were the basis for engineering design, analysis and fabrication of
a laboratory prototype magnetic RBC sorter built from commercially available,
block permanent magnets to serve as a test bed for magnetic RBC separation experi-
ments (Moore et al. 2013).
Another well studied example of cells with different magnetic property is
malaria-infected RBCs. Researchers have utilized malaria byproduct, hemozoin, to
study and seperate malaria-infected RBCs in a magnetic field gradient (Paul et al.
1981; Moore et al. 2006; Hackett et al. 2009; Kasetsirikul et al. 2016). During intra-
erythrocytic maturation, malaria trophozoites could digest up to 80% of cellular
hemoglobin, which accumulates toxic heme. To prevent haem iron from participat-
ing in cell-damaging reactions, the parasite polymerizes beta-hematin dimers to
synthesize insoluble hemozoin crystals. In the process, the heme is converted to a
high-spin ferriheme, whose magnetic properties were studied a long time ago
(Pauling and Coryell 1936). In fact, in 2006, Moore et al. used magnetophoretic cell
motion analysis to provide direct evidence for a graduated increase of live cell mag-
netic susceptibility with developing blood-stage parasites, which is compatible with
hemozoin increase (Moore et al. 2006). In 2009, Hackett et al. experimentally deter-
mined the source of the cellular magnetic susceptibility during parasite growth
(Fig. 4.6). They found that the parasites converted approximately 60% of host cell
haemoglobin to haemozoin and this product was the primary source of the increase

in cell magnetic susceptibility. While the magnetic susceptibility of uninfected cells
was similar to water, the magnetically enriched parasitised cells have higher mag-
netic susceptibility (Hackett et al. 2009). Therefore the magnetic fields with gradi-
ent could be used in malaria diagnosis and malaria-infected RBC separation (Paul
et al. 1981; Kasetsirikul et al. 2016).
Magnetic fractionation of erythrocytes infected with malaria has also been used
in enrichment of infected cells from parasite cultures and separation of infected
cells from uninfected cells in biological and epidemiological research, as well as
clinical diagnosis. In 2010, Karl et al. used high gradient magnetic fractionation
columns to quantitatively characterize the magnetic fractionation process. They
found that the infected cells had approximately 350 times higher magnetic binding
affinity to the column matrix compared to the uninfected cells (Karl et al. 2010). In
addition, the distribution of captured parasite developmental stages shifted to mature
stages as the number of infected cells in the initial samples and flow rate increased
(Karl et al. 2010). Furthermore, in 2013, Nam et al. used permanent magnets and
ferromagnetic wire to make a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic channel
integrated with a ferromagnetic wire fixed on a glass slide to separate infected RBCs
in various developmental stages (Fig. 4.7). Late-stage infected RBCs were sepa-
rated with a recovery rate of around 98.3%. Early-stage infected RBCs had been
difficult to separate due to their low paramagnetic characteristics but can also be
successfully separated with a recovery rate of 73%. Therefore it could provide a
potential tool for malarial-related studies (Nam et al. 2013).
Besides the cell status mentioned above, the cell lifespan or cell age can also
influence SMF-induced cellular effects. In 2011, Sullivan et al. found that various
points during the lifespan of fetal human lung fibroblast WI-38 cells affected the

cellular responses to moderate intensity SMF (Sullivan et al. 2011). SMF exposure
decreased cell attachment by less than 10% in younger cultures (population dou-
bling level 29) but can decrease cell attachment by more than 60% in older cultures
(population doubling level 53). In 2004, Ogiue-Ikeda and Ueno found that the
smooth muscle A7r5 cells could be aligned along an 8 T magnetic field direction
only when the cells were actively proliferating at a higher density (Ogiue-Ikeda and
Ueno 2004). In addition, In 2014 Surma et al. also found that fully differentiated
myotubes at late stages of development were less sensitive to weak SMF and myo-
tubes at the stage when electromechanical coupling was forming dramatically
reduced the contraction frequency during the first minute’s weak SMF exposure
(Surma et al. 2014). These results demonstrate that even for the same cell type and
same SMF exposure, the cellular effects could be influenced by their status, such as
lifespan. The Underlying mechanisms are still unknown and need to be further
investigated.
The above mentioned parameters, including magnetic field strength, cell types,
cell density and cell status, are just a few examples that directly influence the cel-
lular effects of SMFs. It is very likely that other aspects of cell status also contribute
to the differential effects of SMF on cells. There are multiple other factors that
complicate the situation, such as magnetic field exposure time, magnetic field direc-
tion, field gradient, etc. Interested readers can look into our Chap. 1 for more infor-
mation. In the meantime, we recommend researcher in this field to provide as

4.3 Cellular Effects of SMFs 93
detailed information as possible about their experimental setup as well as the bio-
logical samples, which will help us to understand better of the cellular effects of
SMFs. Further investigations at both cellular and molecular levels are needed to get
a comprehensive understanding.
4.3 Cellular Effects of SMFs
SMFs could induce multiple cellular effects depending on the magnetic field itself
as well as the cells examined. Here I will mainly discuss some cellular effects that
have been reported by multiple independent studies, such as SMF-induced changes
in cell orientation, proliferation, microtubule and cell division, actin, viability,
attachment/adhesion, morphology, migration, cell membrane, cell cycle, chromo-
some and DNA, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium. Our focus
here is mainly on human cells.
4.3.1 Cell Orientation
The orientation changes of biomolecules and cells are one of the most studied
aspects of SMF bioeffects. When diamagnetic objects are exposed to strong SMFs,
they align either parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field direction due to the
anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility of the objects.
There are multiple examples for cells align themselves in parallel to the magnetic
field direction. Among them, the best studied example was erythrocytes (red blood
cells, RBCs). The first reported RBC orientation change induced by SMF was in
1965 by Murayama, who found that sickled RBCs were oriented perpendicular to a
0.35 T SMF (Murayama 1965). It is interesting that in 1993, a work carried out by
Higashi et al. showed that normal RBCs were also aligned by an 8 T SMF but the
orientation direction was different from what Muyama have observed (Higashi et al.
1993). Their results showed that normal RBCs oriented with their disk planes paral-
lel to the field direction (Fig. 4.8). In 1995, they reported that the cell membrane
components, including the transmembrane proteins and lipid bilayers were the major
reasons for RBC alignment in 8 T SMF (Higashi et al. 1995). In addition, they found
that the paramagnetism of membrane-bound hemoglobin contributes significantly to
this orientation (Takeuchi et al. 1995; Higashi et al. 1996). These results clearly dem-
onstrate that cells can be oriented by strong SMFs and the effects depend on the
molecular components of the cell. Besides RBCs, more components in the blood
stream have also been studied, such as platelets (Yamagishi et al. 1992; Higashi et al.
1997) and fibrinogen (Torbet et al. 1981; Yamagishi et al. 1990; Iwasaka et al. 1994).
Moreover, some other cells like osteoblast cells, smooth muscle cells and
Schwann cells could also be aligned in parallel to the direction of the strong mag-
netic fields when they are exposed for a prolonged period. In 2000 and 2002, Kotani

Fig. 4.8 Red blood cells were aligned by an 8 T SMF. Right: Red blood cells in control condi-
tion, with no SMF. Left: Red blood cells in an 8 T SMF. The field direction was normal to the paper
(Illustration was drawn based on results from ref. (Higashi et al. 1993))
et al. found that osteoblast cells were oriented in parallel to the field direction by an
8 T SMF and the bone formation was significantly stimulated to grow along the
direction of the magnetic field (Kotani et al. 2000, 2002). In 2001, Umeno et al.
found that smooth muscle cell culture was aligned along the magnetic field direction
after they were exposed to an 8 T SMF for 3 days (Umeno et al. 2001). In 2003,
Iwasaka et al. found that the 14 T SMF aligned smooth muscle cell assemblies and
the cell colonies were extended along the field direction (Iwasaka et al. 2003). In
2003, Eguchi et al. found that Schwann cells were also oriented in parallel to the 8
T SMF after 60 h exposure (Eguchi et al. 2003). They used linearly polarized light
and observed changes in the intracellular macromolecule behaviour in 8 T and 14 T
SMFs (Iwasaka and Ueno 2003a, b). In 2005, they also examined the actin cytoskel-
eton in Schwann cells and found that actin fibers were oriented in the direction of 8
T SMF (Eguchi and Ueno 2005). More interestingly, the Schwann cells did not ori-
ent in the 8 T SMF when an inhibitor of small GTPase (guanosine triphosphatase)
Rho-associated kinase was added, which indicated that the SMF-induced Schwann
cell orientation was dependent on Rho regulated actin fibers (Eguchi and Ueno
2005). In 2007, Coletti et al. found that 80 mT SMF induced myogenic cell line L6
cells to align in parallel bundles, an orientation conserved throughout differentia-
tion. They proposed that SMF-enhanced parallel orientation of myotubes was rele-
vant to tissue engineering of a highly organized tissue such as skeletal muscle
(Coletti et al. 2007).

4.3 Cellular Effects of SMFs 95
In the meantime, there are also multiple examples showing that cells could align in
perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic fields, such as the bull sperm. The ori-
entation of bull sperm was examined by a few studies, which actually showed stronger
alignment effects than RBCs and platelets. The bull sperm cell has a fat head that
mainly contains diamagnetic cell membrane and DNA. It also has a long tail with
microtubules inside. In 2001, Emura et al. found that the orientation of bull sperm
cells could be affected by SMFs in an intensity-dependent manner (Emura et al. 2001).
They found that the bull sperm could reach 100% alignment perpendicular to the
direction of the magnetic field at just below 1 T (Emura et al. 2001). In 2003, Emura
et al. showed that the whole bull sperm and the sperm heads were orientated perpen-
dicular to 1.7 T SMF while the paramecium cilia were aligned in parallel to 8 T SMF
(Emura et al. 2003). It was interesting that the sperm tail is theoretically predicted to
be in parallel with the field direction due to the diamagnetic anisotropy of microtu-
bules, which will be discussed later. But why the whole sperm is aligned in perpen-
dicular to the field direction is still unclear. It is possible that the sperm head has a
stronger diamagnetic anisotropy, which dominates the whole sperm.
Another example of cell orientation in perpendicular to the direction of the mag-
netic field is neurite outgrowth. In 2008, Kim et al. showed that the application of
0.12 T SMF for 3–5 days could be used to modulate the orientation and direction of
neurite formation in cultured human neuronal SH-SY5Y cells and PC12 cells (Kim
et al. 2008). It is interesting that they found the neurites perpendicular to the SMF
had long, thin and straight appearance while the neurites in parallel to the SMF direc-
tion had “thickeded or beaded” dystrophic appearance. More importantly, they not
only found the neurites tended to orient perpendicular to the direction of SMF, the
direction can also be changed after the SMF direction has changed (Kim et al. 2008).
From evidences mentioned above, we can conclude that SMF-induced cell orien-
tation is cell type-dependent. Actually, as we have mentioned earlier, Ogiue-Ikeda
and Ueno compared three different cell lines, including the smooth muscle A7r5
cells, human glioma GI-1 cells and human kidney HFK293 cells for their orienta-
tion changes under 8 T for 60 h exposure. They found that while the smooth muscle
A7r5 cells and the human glioma GI-1 cells aligned along the field direction, the
human kidney HEK293 cells were not aligned (Ogiue-Ikeda and Ueno 2004). They
proposed that this was probably due to their different cell shapes because both A7r5
and GI-1 cells were spindle shaped while HEK293 cells were polygonal shaped. In
addition, the orientation of adherent cells such as osteoblasts, smooth muscle cells
and Schwann cells in strong SMFs usually took a few days while floating cells such
as RBCs exhibited a diamagnetic torque rotation in only a few seconds under mag-
netic fields of the same intensity. This also implies that when our human bodies are
exposed to externally applied magnetic fields, the free circulating blood cells would
be affected more readily compared to other types of cells.
Table 4.1 summarizes some reported studies about the orientation of cells in SMFs
(Table 4.1). It is apparent that other than cell types, the SMF-induced cell orientation
change is largely dependent on the magnetic field intensity. The reported cell orienta-
tion changes were all achieved in SMFs of at least 80 mT, and actually most of them
were done in strong magnets, such as in 8 T SMF. Therefore it is not surprising

SMF does not affect cell orientation
when Gioia et al. investigated the effect of chronic exposure to a 2 mT SMF on in vitro
cultured swine granulosa cells (GCs) and did not observe cell orientation changes
(Gioia et al. 2013). In addition, the cell type is an important factor because most cells
do not have strong structure characteristics like sperm cell, nor RBCs.
Besides the orientation change of cells themselves in magnetic fields, cells can
also be oriented by moderate and strong SMFs when they are embedded in collagen,
a macromolecule that has strong diamagnetic anisotropy (Torbet and Ronziere 1984).

--- Page 103 ---

4.3 Cellular Effects of SMFs 97
In 1993, Guido and Tranquillo found that human foreskin fibroblasts embedded in
collagen gel were oriented by 4.0 and 4.7 T SMFs (Guido and Tranquillo 1993).
Human glioblastoma A172 cells embedded in collagen gels, but not A172 cells alone,
oriented perpendicular to the field direction of 10 T SMF (Hirose et al. 2003).
Therefore the orientation for cells embedded in collagen is largely due to the diamag-
netic anisotropy of collagen fibers, which orient in perpendicular direction of
SMF. Another example was provided in 2000 by Kotani et al., who found that osteo-
blast cells themselves were oriented in parallel to the field direction by an 8 T SMF,
but the mixture of osteoblast cells and collagen oriented perpendicular to the mag-
netic fields (Kotani et al. 2000). This is interesting and promising because the stimu-
lation of bone formation to an intended direction using a combination of strong SMF
and potent osteogenic agents could possibly lead to a clinically viable treatment of
bone fractures and defects. In addition, in 2003, Eguchi et al. found that Schwann
cells themselves oriented in parallel to the 8 T SMF after 60 h exposure but when
they were embedded in collagen, they were aligned in perpendicular to the field
direction (Eguchi et al. 2003). These data all showed that the collagen has a strong
alignment effect on cells embedded in SMFs.
The shapes of most mammalian somatic cells are close to symmetric and are also
surrounded by and attached to their extracellular matrix and neighboring cells.
Therefore they are less likely to have strong alignment effects in SMFs like sperm
cells or RBCs in weak to moderate intensity SMFs. However, the SMF-induced
orientation effects can potentially affect their cell division and subsequently affect
the tissue development. In addition, it was very promising that Kotani et al. found
that an 8 T SMF could cause osteoblasts to orient in parallel to the magnetic field
and stimulate bone formation along the field direction. This implies that people may
be able to apply SMFs in clinical treatment such as bone disorders. In fact, the ori-
entation effects of RBCs might also provide some insights to help understanding the
working mechanism of some magnetic therapy products. Continued efforts are
encouraged to investigate more on blood cells, muscles, neurons, bones and sperms,
as well as their potential medical applications in the future.
4.3.2 Cell Proliferation/Growth
Multiple evidences showed that SMFs could inhibit cell proliferation. For example,
1976, Malinin et al. exposed mouse fibroblast L-929 cells and human embryonic
lung fibroblast WI-38 cells to 0.5 T SMF for 4–8 h after they were frozen in liquid
nitrogen and found that the subsequent cell growth was significantly inhibited
(Malinin et al. 1976). In 1999 Pacini et al. examined the effects of 0.2 T SMF in
human breast cancer cells and found that 0.2 T not only reduced cell proliferation
but also enhanced the vitamin D anti-proliferative effect (Pacini et al. 1999a). In
2003, Pacini et al. examined human skin fibroblasts for their effects in 0.2 T SMF
generated by a magnetic resonance tomography and found that the cell proliferation
was reduced (Pacini et al. 2003). In 2008, Hsieh et al. found that 3 T SMF inhibited

--- Page 104 ---

98 4 Impact of Static Magnetic Fields (SMFs) on Cells
human chondrocytes growth in vitro and affected recovery of damaged knee carti-
lage in vivo in the pig model. They also mentioned that these results may be specific
to the parameters used in this study and may not apply to other situations, field
strengths, forms of cartilage injury, or animal species (Hsieh et al. 2008). In 2012,
Li et al. found that the proliferation of human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells
(hUASMCs) was significantly decreased after 5 mT SMF exposure for 48 h com-
pared with the non-treated group (Li et al. 2012). In 2013, Mo et al. showed that
magnetic shielding increased human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell proliferation
(Mo et al. 2013), which indicated that the geomagnetic field may have an inhibitory
effect on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell proliferation. In 2013, Gioia et al. investi-
gated the effect of a 2 mT SMF on swine granulosa cells (GCs) and found that the
doubling time was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in exposed samples after 72 h of
culture (Gioia et al. 2013). In 2016, Wang et al. exposed adipose-derived stem cells
(ASCs) to 0.5 T SMF for 7 days and found that the cell proliferation was inhibited
(Wang et al. 2016). Recently we found that 1 T and 9 T SMFs could inhibit the
proliferation of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma CNE-2Z and colon cancer
HCT116 cells (Zhang et al. 2015, 2016).
There are also some studies showing that SMFs could promote proliferation of
some cell types, such as bone marrow cells, stem cells as well as endothelia cells.
For example, Martino et al. found that 60 and 120 μT SMFs increased the cell pro-
liferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cell (Martino et al. 2010). In 2013,
Chuo et al. found that a 0.2 T SMF increased the proliferation of bone marrow stem
cells (Chuo et al. 2013). In 2007, Stolfa et al. used MTT assay to study the effect of
0.6 T SMF on human chondrocytes and found that the MTT reading was increased
by 0.6 T SMF (Stolfa et al. 2007), which was probably due to the increased cell
proliferation and/or cell viability or metabolic activity. In 2016, Lew et al. showed
that 0.4 T SMF enhanced dental pulp stem cell proliferation (Lew et al. 2016).
Recently, Maredziak et al. found that 0.5 T SMF increased the proliferation rate of
human adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal stem cells (hASCs) via activation of
the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway (Maredziak et al.
2017).
However, there are also some studies shown that cell proliferation was not
affected by SMFs. For example, in 1992 Short et al. found that 4.7 T SMF treatment
did not affect cell number of either human malignant melanoma cells or the normal
human cells (Short et al. 1992). In 2005, Gao et al. found that even 14.1 T SMF
(provided by an NMR spectrometer) exposure for 12 h did not affect cell growth of
bacterial strain Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 (Gao et al. 2005). In 2007, Coletti
et al. found that 80 mT SMF did not affect myotube cell proliferation (Coletti et al.
2007). In 2010, Hsu and Chang found that 0.29 T SMF did not affect the cell prolif-
eration of dental pulp cells (Hsu and Chang 2010). In 2015, Reddig et al. found that
exposure of unstimulated mononuclear blood cells to 7 T SMF alone or in combina-
tion with varying gradient magnetic fields and pulsed radiofrequency fields did not
affect cell proliferation (Reddig et al. 2015). Recently, Iachininoto et al. investigated
the effects of 1.5 T and 3 T gradient SMFs for their effects on hematopoietic stem
cells and found that the cell proliferation was not affected (Iachininoto et al. 2016).

--- Page 105 ---

4.3 Cellular Effects of SMFs 99
Therefore, not surprisingly, the effect of SMFs on cell proliferation is also cell
type dependent. Table 4.2 summarizes some reported studies about the SMF-
induced cell proliferation/growth changes (Table 4.2). For example, in 2003
Aldinucci et al. tested the effects of combining a 4.75 T SMF and a pulsed EMF of
0.7 mT generated by an NMR apparatus (NMRF). They found that the 4.75 SMF
did not affect cell proliferation in both normal and PHA activated peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC), but significantly reduced proliferation in Jurkat leuke-
mia cells (Aldinucci et al. 2003b). We found that 1–9 T SMFs inhibited CNE-2Z
and HCT116 cancer cells but not the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (Zhang
et al. 2016). In addition, we found that the EGFR/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway,
which was upregulated in many cancers, was involved in SMF-induced cancer cell
proliferation inhibition (Zhang et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2016). In addition, as we
have mentioned before, SMF-induced effects on cell proliferation was not only cell
type-dependent, but also dependent on magnetic field intensity as well as cell den-
sity. More investigations are needed to unravel additional mechanisms and specific
effects of a given SMF on a specific cell type.
4.3.3 Microtubule and Cell Division
Purified microtubules have been known for a long time to be a target of SMFs as
well as electric fields, which align along the magnetic field and electric field direc-
tion (Fig. 4.9a) due to diamagnetic anisotropy of tubulin dimers (Vassilev et al.
1982; Bras et al. 1998, 2014; Minoura and Muto 2006; Wang et al. 2008). It was
also shown that tubulin assembly in vitro was disordered by a 10–100 nT hypogeo-
magnetic field (Wang et al. 2008). These studies demonstrated that microtubules
could be affected by SMFs in vitro, but the effects of SMFs on microtubules in cells
were less reported. In 2005 Valiron et al. showed that the microtubule and actin
cytoskeleton could be affected by 7–17 T high SMFs in some cell types during
interphase (Valiron et al. 2005). In 2013, Gioia observed actin and alpha-tubulin
cytoskeleton modifications in swine granulosa cells after 3 days exposure to a 2 mT
SMF (Gioia et al. 2013). However, this effect seems to be cell type- and/or exposure
time-dependent because our group did not observe obvious microtubule abnormali-
ties in CNE-2Z or RPE1 interphase cells when we exposed them to 1 T SMF for 3
days or 27 T ultra-strong SMF for 4 h (data not shown).
Microtubule is a key component for mitotic spindle, which is mainly composed
of microtubules and chromosomes and are the fundamental machinery for cell divi-
sion. However, information about the mitotic spindles in SMFs was not provided in
above mentioned studies. In contrast, PMFs and electric fields have been shown to
be able to affect mitotic spindle and cell division. For example, in 1999 Zhao et al.
found that a small physiological electric field could orient cultured human corneal
epithelial cells through affecting cell division (Zhao et al. 1999). In 2011, Schrader
et al. observed spindle disturbances in human-hamster hybrid A(L) cells induced

4.3 Cellular Effects of SMFs 101

abnormal mitotic spindles (left) and mitotic index (right) induced by 1 T SMF treatment for 7 days.
Data represent the mean ± SD. *P < 0.05 (Figure was reprinted with permission from ref. (Luo
et al. 2016). Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V)
(Schrader et al. 2011). However, for PMFs, people need to distinguish the effects
caused by the magnetic fields per se or the thermal effect. In 2011, Ballardin et al.
found that 2.45 GHz microwaves could disrupt spindle assembly (inducing multipo-
lar spindles) in Chinese hamster V-79 cells, which was not due to the thermal effects
(Ballardin et al. 2011). In contrast, in 2013, Samsonov and Popov found that expo-
sure to 94 GHz radiation increased the rate of microtubule assembly and that effect
was actually caused by the thermal effect (Samsonov and Popov 2013). The thermal
effect in Samsonov and Popov’s study is likely due to the high frequency compared
to Ballardin et al.’s study. Moreover, there is a well known electromagnetic approach
called tumor treating fields (TTF, TTFields) that uses low-intensity (1–3 V/cm) and
intermediate-frequency (100–300 kHz) alternating electric fields to treat cancers
such as glioblastoma. The mechanism has been proved to be mainly through dis-
turbing mitotic spindle formation (Kirson et al. 2004; Pless and Weinberg 2011;
Davies et al. 2013). TTFields destroy cells within the process of mitosis via apopto-
sis and have no effect on non-dividing cells (Pless and Weinberg 2011). In fact, the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved this technology for use in glio-
blastoma (Davis 2013), which was also discussed in Chap. 2.

--- Page 108 ---

102
We recently found that mitotic spindles could be affected by SMFs (Fig. 4.9b) (Luo
et al. 2016). Our results show that 1 T SMF treatment for 7 days could increase the
abnormal mitotic spindles (Fig. 4.9b, c) and mitotic index (% of cells in mitosis) in
HeLa cells (Fig. 4.9c), which is likely due to the effect of SMF on microtubules. In
addition, this phenotype is also time-dependent because when cells were treated for
shorter time, the effects were not obvious. Although 1 T SMF did not affect the overall
cell cycle distribution, it could delay the mitotic exit using synchronization experiment
(Luo et al. 2016), which will be discussed in the cell cycle section later in this chapter.
Since purified microtubules can be aligned by SMFs, we predict that the spindle
orientation could also be affected, which is a critical determining factor for cell divi-
sion orientation. In fact, back in 1998, Denegre et al. found that 16.7 T large gradi-
ent high SMF could affect the division orientation of Xenopus eggs (Fig. 4.10)
(Denegre et al. 1998). In 2006, Eguchi et al. showed that 8 T SMF could also change
the cleavage plan formation in frog embryo division (Eguchi et al. 2006). It was
proposed that SMFs may affect the orientation of astral microtubules and/or spin-
dles, which was theoretically proven later by Valles (Valles 2002; Valles et al. 2002).
In 2012, Mo et al. found that hypogeomagnetic field (HGMF; magnetic fields <200
nT) could cause a decrease in horizontal third cleavage furrows and abnormal mor-
phogenesis in Xenopus embryos (Mo et al. 2012). In addition, they used immuno-
fluorescence staining of tubulin to show the reorientation of the spindle of four-cell
stage blastomeres. Their results indicated that a brief (2-h) exposure to HGMF was
sufficient to interfere with the development of Xenopus embryos at cleavage stages.
Also, the mitotic spindle could be an early sensor to the deprivation of the geomag-
netic field, which provided a clue to the molecular mechanism underlying the mor-
phological and other changes observed in the developing and/or developed embryos
(Mo et al. 2012).
In the meantime, although it was shown that the microtubule and actin cyto-
skeleton in interphase cells could be affected by 7–17 T high SMFs in some cell
types (Valiron et al. 2005), information about the mitotic spindle in high SMFs

was not provided. Recently, using human nasopharyngeal cancer CNE-2Z cells
and human retinal pigment epithelial RPE1 cells, we found that the spindle orien-
tation could be altered by a 27 T ultra-high SMF. More interestingly, we found
that the spindle orientation was determined by both microtubules and chromo-
somes (Zhang et al. 2017c).
4.3.4 Actin
Besides microtubules, the actin cytoskeleton has also been reported to be affected
by SMFs in some cell types. For example, Mo et al. recently showed that in the
absence of the geomagnetic field (GMF), the so-called hypomagnetic field (HMF)
environment, the adhesion and migration of human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y
cell line) were inhibited, which were accompanied with a reduction in cellular
F-actin amount and disordered kinetics of actin assembly in vitro (Mo et al. 2016).
These results indicated that elimination of the GMF affected assembly of the
motility-r elated actin cytoskeleton, and suggested that F-actin was a target of HMF
exposure and probably a mediator of GMF sensation (Mo et al. 2016).
Although whether actin could serve as a mediator of GMF sensation still needs
to be further confirmed, there are multiple other studies have shown that actin could
be affected in cells by SMFs. The most striking and convincing data was provided
in 2005 by Eguchi and Ueno (Eguchi and Ueno 2005), which was briefly mentioned
in the cell orientation section above. They examined the actin cytoskeleton in 8 T
ultra-high SMF treated Schwann cells and found that actin fibers were oriented in
the direction of the magnetic field. However, when the Schwann cells were treated
with an inhibitor of small GTPase Rho-associated kinase, which disrupted actin
fibers, the orientation phenotype induced by 8 T SMF no longer existed. This indi-
cated that the SMF-induced Schwann cell orientation was dependent on Rho
regulated actin fibers (Eguchi and Ueno 2005). Therefore their data directly showed
that the Rho-regulated actin fibers were involved in SMF-induced cell orientation,
at least in Schwann cell. Another example for SMF-induced actin alteration was in
2007 by Coletti et al., who used myogenic cell line L6 and found that 80 mT SMF
promoted myogenic cell alignment and differentiation (Coletti et al. 2007), which
was also introduced in the preious cell orientation section (Table 4.1). More specifi-
cally, they observed increased accumulation of actin and myosin as well as forma-
tion of large multinucleated myotubes, which was derived from increased cell
fusion efficiency, but not cell proliferation (Coletti et al. 2007). In addition, a few
other studies also showed SMF-induced actin alterations. For example, in 2009,
Dini et al. found that 72 h of 6 mT SMF exposure caused human leukemia U937 cell
F-actin modification (Dini et al. 2009). In 2013, Gioia found actin cytoskeleton
modifications in swine granulosa cells after 3 days exposure to a 2 mT SMF (Gioia
et al. 2013). Recently, Lew et al. found that 0.4 T SMF could increase the fluores-
cence intensity of the F-actin (Lew et al. 2016). Furthermore, Zhang et al. found that
16 T SMF disrupted actin formation in pre-osteoclast Raw264.7 cells but 500 nT
and 0.2 T SMFs did not (Zhang et al. 2017a).

--- Page 110 ---

104 4 Impact of Static Magnetic Fields (SMFs) on Cells
There are also some studies that reported the unchanged actin in SMF-treated
cells. For example, in 2005, Bodega et al. examined primary cultures of astroglial
cells for their responses to 1 mT sinusoidal, static, or combined magnetic field for
various timepoints and did not observe any significant changes on actin (Bodega
et al. 2005). In my opinion, the magnetic field strength in their study might be too
low to induce actin alteration. Recently we examined multiple human cancer cells,
such as human nasopharyngeal cancer CNE-2Z and colon cancer HCT116 cells, for
their responses to 1 T SMF for 2–3 days and did not observe any significant changes
on actin (data not shown). However, the cells we examined are different from above
mentioned cell types that have actin alterations upon SMF exposure, such as neuro-
blastoma cells, Schwann cells and myogenic cell. These cells may have different
actin regulation network than the cancer cell lines we examined. From the above
mentioned studies, it is likely that actin cytoskeleton in cells respond to SMFs in a
cell type- and magnetic field intensity-dependent way, which will need more sys-
tematic investigations.
4.3.5 Cell Viability
So far most studies showed that SMFs had minimum effects on cell viability. For
example, In 1992, Short et al. found that 4.7 T SMF treatment did not affect cell
viability in both human malignant melanoma cells and normal human fibroblast
cells (Short et al. 1992). In 2003, Pacini et al. found that 0.2 T SMF could affect the
cell morphology and proliferation but not the cell viability of human skin fibroblasts
(Pacini et al. 2003). In 2009 Dini et al. reported that 72 h exposure of 6 mT SMF did
not affect cell viability in human leukemia U937 cells (Dini et al. 2009). In 2013,
Gioia investigated the effect of chronic exposure to a 2 mT SMF on in vitro cultured
swine granulosa cells (GCs) and found that the SMF exposure did not affect the cell
viability (Gioia et al. 2013). In 2016, Romeo et al. examined MRC-5 human foetal
lung fibroblasts exposed to 370 mT SMF and found that the cell viability was not
affected (Romeo et al. 2016). Recently we examined 1 T SMF induced effects on
cell viability in 15 different cell lines, including human cancer cell lines CNE-2Z,
A431 and A549, non-cancer cell line 293 T as well as CHO cells (Fig. 4.11). In fact,
we checked four different cell densities and found that the cell viability was not
obviously changed by 1 T SMF in any of these cell types (Fig. 4.11) (Zhang et al.
2017b). These studies, including more than 20 different cell types, showed that
SMFs do not have obviously effect on cell viability.
However, there are a few studies indicate that SMFs could increase apoptosis
in some cell types. In 2005, Chionna et al. reported that 6 mT SMF induced
apoptosis in Hep G2 cells in a time-dependent manner. The apoptosis was
almost negligible at the beginning of experiment but increased to about 20%
after 24 h of continuous exposure (Chionna et al. 2005). In 2006, Tenuzzo et al.
found that 6 mT SMF could promote apoptosis in thybridoma 3DO, human liver
cancer Hep G2 cells and rat thyroid FRTL cells, but not human lymphocytes,

--- Page 111 ---

4.3 Cellular Effects of SMFs 105
Fig. 4.11 1 T SMF exposure of two days does not promote cell death in multiple cells lines.
Various cells were plated at different density one day ahead and treated with 1 T SMF for 48 h
before they were analyzed for cell death using Annexin/PI stain and flow cytometry. Representative
raw data (a) and quantification of live, apoptotic and necrotic cell numbers (b) are shown (Reprinted
from ref. (Zhang et al. 2017b). Copyright © 2016 Impact Journals, LLC)
mice thymocytes, human histiocytic lymphoma or human cervical cancer HeLa
cells (Tenuzzo et al. 2006). In 2008, Hsieh et al. found that 3 T SMF induced
human chondrocytes apoptosis through p53, p21, p27 and Bax protein expres-
sion (Hsieh et al. 2008). In 2016, Wang et al. exposed adipose-derived Stem
Cells (ASCs) to 0.5 T SMF for 7 days and found that the cell viability was
inhibited (Wang et al. 2016).
It is interesting and puzzling that when SMFs are combined with some other
treatments, they have been shown to have totally diverse effects. For example, in
2001, Tofani et al. found that when 3 mT SMF was combined with 3 mT 50 Hz
PMF, the apoptosis of WiDr and MCF-7 cancer cells were increased while the

--- Page 112 ---

106 4 Impact of Static Magnetic Fields (SMFs) on Cells
MRC-5 cells were not affected (Tofani et al. 2001). In 2006 Ghibelli et al. found that
exposure to SMFs of NMR (1 T) could increase damage-induced apoptosis in tumor
cells of haematopoietic origin, but not mononuclear white blood cells, showing that
NMR may increase the differential cytotoxicity of antitumor drugs on tumor vs.
normal cells (Ghibelli et al. 2006). These studies show that SMF could promote the
apoptosis effects of PMF or antitumor drugs. However, there are also evidences
showing that SMF could protect some cells from apoptosis. For example, in 1999
Fanelli et al. showed that 0.3–60 mT SMFs could reduce cell apoptosis induced by
damaging agents such as etoposide (VP16) and puromycin (PMC) (Fanelli et al.
1999). It was also interesting that although Tenuzzo et al. found 6 mT SMF could
promote apoptosis in thybridoma 3DO, human liver cancer Hep G2 cells and rat
thyroid FRTL cells, when the SMF was combined with apoptotic inducing drugs,
such as cycloheximide, puromycin, it had a protective effect because the majority of
cells could be rescued from apoptosis, except for 3DO (Tenuzzo et al. 2006).
Therefore the effect of SMFs on cell apoptosis is magnetic field intensity, treat-
ment time, and most importantly, cell type-dependent. In most reported cases, the
cell viability was not affected by SMFs. However, there were also a few reports
indicating that some cells could be affected. In addition, SMFs could have combi-
national or antagonistic effects when they are combined with other treatments, such
as PMFs or different cell damaging agents. Further investigations are strongly
needed to unravel the underlying mechanisms.
4.3.6 Cell Attachment/Adhesion
There are several studies showing that the cell attachment could be affected by
SMFs. For example, in 2011 Sullivan et al. exposed the cells directly to SMFs right
after seeding with an exposure time of 18 h and found that WI-38 (human fetal lung
fibroblast cells) attachment was significantly reduced by 35–120 mT SMFs (Sullivan
et al. 2011). In 2012, Li et al. exposed human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells
(hUASMCs) to 5 mT SMF for 48 h and found that the cell adhesion was obviously
decreased (Li et al. 2012). In 2014, Wang et al. found that moderate intensity SMFs
of 0.26–0.33 T could reduce human breast cancer MCF-7 cell attachment (Wang
et al. 2014).
Although these results indicate that cell attachment/adhesion may be affected by
SMFs, the consensus result is still lacking. In most cases, SMFs seem to reduce the
cell attachment/adhesion, there are also opposite evidences. For example, Mo et al.
found that shielding of the geomagnetic field also inhibited cell adhesion and migra-
tion accompanied with a reduction in cellular F-actin amount in human neuroblas-
toma SH-SY5Y cells (Mo et al. 2016). This indicates that in the absence of SMF, the
cell attachment could also be reduced. Moreover, in our own experience, the cell
attachment/adhesion of most cells was not affected by moderate intensity SMFs.
Not surprisingly, the SMF-induced changes in cell attachment also seemed to be
cell type-dependent. In 1992, Short et al. tested both human malignant melanoma

--- Page 113 ---

4.3 Cellular Effects of SMFs 107
cells and the normal human cells and found that the malignant melanoma cells had
reduced attachment to the tissue culture surface while the normal fibroblasts were not
affected by the 4.7 T SMF (Short et al. 1992). More recently, Wang et al. found that
although human breast cancer MCF-7 cell attachment was reduced by moderate
intensity SMFs of 0.26–0.33 T, the HeLa cell attachment was not affected (Wang
et al. 2014). In addition to the different cell types, the experimental procedure, such
as the timing of SMF exposure before or after the cells have been attached to the cell
culture plates, is also likely to be a key factor that influences the experimental out-
comes. Moreover, we found that the supporting substrate, such as the cell culture
plate and the coverslip, can also influence the experimental results about cell attach-
ment/adhesion. Therefore more researches are certainly needed to examine the exact
effects of SMFs on cell attachment/adhesion, as well as their consequences in vivo.
4.3.7 Cell Morphology
Multiple studies have shown that the cell shape can be altered by SMFs. In 2003,
Pacini et al. found that the morphology of human skin fibroblast cells were modified
by 0.2 T SMF (Pacini et al. 2003). In the same year, Iwasaka et al. found that 14 T
SMF affected the morphology of smooth muscle cell assemblies, and the shapes of
the cell colonies extended along the direction of the magnetic flux (Iwasaka et al.
2003). Chinonna et al. also reported time-dependent cell shape and membrane
microvilli changes in human histiocytic lymphoma U937 cells and human lympho-
cytes by a 6 mT SMF (Chionna et al. 2003). In 2005, Chionna et al. found that Hep
G2 cells exposed to 6 mT SMF for 24 h were elongated with many irregular micro-
villi randomly distributed on the cell surface, as well as a less flat shape due to
partial detachment from the culture dishes. In addition, cytoskeleton was also modi-
fied in a time dependent manner (Chionna et al. 2005). In 2009, Dini et al. found
that 72 h of 6 mT SMF caused human leukemia U937 cell shape change and F-actin
modification, appearance of membrane roughness and large blebs and impaired
expression of specific macrophagic markers on the cell surface (Dini et al. 2009). It
was also interesting that although the cell growth was inhibited, the average cell size
of rat pituitary adenoma GH3 cells was increased by prolonged exposure to 0.5 T
SMF (Rosen and Chastney 2009). In 2013, Gioia found cell length and thickness
changes, as well as actin and alpha-tubulin cytoskeleton modifications in swine
granulosa cells after 3 days exposure to a 2 mT SMF (Gioia et al. 2013). Recently,
Mo et al. found that magnetic shielding made the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y
cells smaller in size and more round in shape, which was likely due to the disor-
dered kinetics of actin assembly (Mo et al. 2016).
Not surprisingly, there are also many studies that did not observe cell morphol-
ogy changes after SMF exposure. For example, in 1992 Sato et alo found that there
were no cell shape changes in HeLa cells after 1.5 T SMF exposure for 96 h (Sato
et al. 1992). In 2003, Iwasaka et al. found that no distinct changes in cell morphol-
ogy in smooth muscle cells including cell membrane components occurred during

--- Page 114 ---

108 4 Impact of Static Magnetic Fields (SMFs) on Cells
the 3 h exposure to 8 T magnetic field (Iwasaka and Ueno 2003b). In 2005, Bodega
et al. examined primary cultures of astroglial cells for their responses to 1 mT sinu-
soidal, static, or combined magnetic fields for various timepoints and did not
observe any significant changes on actin (Bodega et al. 2005). Again, the cell type
may play a very important role in the SMF-induced cell morphology changes. For
example, In 1999, Pacini et al. found that a 0.2 T magnetic field induced obvious
morphology change in human neuronal FNC-B4 cell but did not affect mouse leu-
kemia or human breast carcinoma cells (Pacini et al. 1999b).
In addition, multiple other factors could also determine whether people can
observe cell morphology changes after SMF exposure, such as magnetic field inten-
sity and exposure time, as well as detection techniques and experimental setup.
There are two studies that both used freezing and SMF but the experimental results
are totally different. The first one was in 1976, Malinin et al. exposed mouse fibro-
blast L-929 cells and human embryonic lung fibroblast WI-38 cells to 0.5 T SMF
for 4–8 h after they were frozen and found that the cell morphology was signifi-
cantly changed after they were thawed and cultured for 1–5 weeks (Malinin et al.
1976). In contrast, in 2013, Lin et al. found that when 0.4 or 0.8 T SMFs were used
during the slow cooling procedures of RBCs, the survival rates of frozen-thawed
RBCs were increased and there was no morphological changes (Lin et al. 2013).
The mechanisms of the SMF + freezing-induced cell growth and/or morphological
changes between these two studies are still unknown, which could due to the
SMF + freezing procedure differences, or cell type differences. More studies are
needed to test more cells in both procedures to reveal the underlying mechanisms.
4.3.8 Cell Migration
There are a few studies showing that SMFs could affect cell migration. Back in
1990, Papatheofanis found that 0.1 T SMF could inhibit cell migration of human
polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) (Papatheofanis 1990). In 2012, Li et al.
found that 5 mT SMF treatment for 48 h inhibited human umbilical artery smooth
muscle cells (hUASMCs) migration (Li et al. 2012). In 2016, Mo et al. found that in
the absence of the geomagnetic field (GMF), the so-called hypomagnetic field
(HMF), cell migration was inhibited accompanied with a reduction in cellular
F-actin amount (Mo et al. 2016). Besides SMFs, recently Kim et al. showed that
TTF also inhibited U87 and U373 glioblastoma cell migration (Kim et al. 2016).
There are also many studies using gradient SMFs to separate different cell pop-
ulations based on their different migration ability, which is called magnetophore-
sis. Based on the measured magnetic moments of hemoglobin and the relatively
high hemoglobin concentration of human RBCs, the differential migration of
RBCs was possible if exposed to a high gradient SMF. For example, in 2003,
Zborowski et al. used a mean magnetic field of 1.40 T and a mean gradient of 0.131
T/mm to separate deoxygenated and methemoglobin (metHb)-containing
RBCs (Zborowski et al. 2003). The existence of unpaired electrons in the four

--- Page 115 ---

4.3 Cellular Effects of SMFs 109
heme groups of deoxy and metHb gives them paramagnetic properties, which is
very different from the diamagnetic property of oxyhemoglobin. Zborowski et al.
showed that the magnetophoretic mobility for erythrocytes with 100% deoxygen-
ated hemoglobin and for erythrocytes containing 100% metHb were similar, while
oxygenated erythrocytes were diamagnetic (Zborowski et al. 2003).
Magnetophoresis could provide a way to characterize and separate cells based on
magnetic properties of biological macromolecules in cells (Zborowski et al. 2003).
In fact, this technique has been used in both malaria detection and infected eryth-
rocyte separation. Although many other techniques are also available, magneto-
phoretic is very promising because their high specificity for malaria parasite-infected
RBCs (Kasetsirikul et al. 2016).
There are also some studies using gradient SMFs to “guide” cell migration. For
example, in 2013, Zablotskii et al. showed that SMF gradient could assist cell
migration to those areas with the strongest magnetic field gradient, thereby allowing
the buildup of tunable interconnected stem cell networks, which is an elegant route
for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (Zablotskii et al. 2013).
4.3.9 Cell Membrane
Multiple studies have shown that the cell membrane permeability can be increased by
SMFs. For example, in 2011, Liu et al. used AFM (Atomic Force Microscope) to
reveal that a 9 mT SMF could increase the number and size of the holes on the cell
membrane of K562 cells, which may increase the membrane permeability and the
flow of the anticancer drugs (Liu et al. 2011). In 2012, Bajpai et al. found that 0.1 T
SMF could suppress both gram positive (S. epidermidis) and gram negative bacteria
(E. coli) growth, which was likely due to SMF-induced cell membrane damages
(Bajpai et al. 2012). There are also multiple studies indicated that SMFs could increase
the membrane rigidity in cells. For example, in 2013, Lin et al. found that a 0.8 T SMF
decreased membrane fluidity and enhanced erythrocyte membrane stability to resist
dehydration damage caused by slow cooling procedures (Lin et al. 2013). They found
that the SMF coupled with the slow cooling procedure increased the survival rates of
frozen-thawed erythrocytes without obvious cellular damage. Therefore they pro-
posed that the SMFs increased the biophysical stability of the cell membrane, which
reduced dehydration damage to the erythrocyte membrane during the slow cooling
procedure (Lin et al. 2013). In 2015, Hsieh et al. showed that dental pulp cells (DPCs)
treated with a 0.4 T SMF had a higher tolerance to ipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced
inflammatory response when compared to untreated controls. They suggested that 0.4
T SMF attenuates LPS-induced inflammatory response to DPCs by changing cell
membrane stability/rigidity (Hsieh et al. 2015). Recently, Lew et al. used 0.4 T SMF
to treat dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) and suggested that the cell membranes of the
DPSCs were affected to influence intracellular calcium (Lew et al. 2016).
The effects of SMFs on cell membrane are also cell type-dependent. In 2006,
Nuccitelli et al. showed that 6 mT SMF exposure for 5 min affected cell membrane

110 4 Impact of Static Magnetic Fields (SMFs) on Cells
potential differently in various cell types. Specifically, the 6 mT SMF caused depo-
larization in Jurkat cells but hyperpolarization in U937 cells (Nuccitelli et al. 2006).
In addition, high resolution imaging techniques like AFM or Electron Microscopy
are also important to reveal the SMF-induced cell membrane changes, which have
been used in multiple studies to reveal the membrane changes or membrane associ-
ated protein changes caused by SMFs (Jia et al. 2007; Liu et al. 2011; Wang et al.
2014). In contrast, low resolution imaging techniques are less likely to unravel the
membrane changes. In 2010, Wang et al. used an illustration to show the potential
mechanism of SMFs on cell membrane, some of the associated receptors and chan-
nel proteins, as well as the downstream effectors (Wang et al. 2010). They proposed
that the cell membrane is one of the major targets of SMFs in cells, which is largely
due to the diamagnetic anisotropy of phospholipid molecules in the lipid bilayer
(Braganza et al. 1984). The phospholipid molecules would align or reorient in the
SMFs, which consequently affect the bulk biophysical properties of the cell mem-
brane. In addition, since membrane dynamics changes can affect the activity of
membrane embedded proteins, SMFs may also affect some of the membrane associ-
ated proteins, such as mechanosensitive ion channels or other embedded proteins
(Petrov and Martinac 2007; Wang et al. 2010).
4.3.10 Cell Cycle
There are a few studies indicating that SMFs may be able to affect cell cycle in some
types of cells or at specific conditions. For example, in 2010 Chen et al. found that
8.8 mT SMF increased the G2/M phase and decreased G1 and S phases in K562
cells (Chen et al. 2010). In 2013 Mo et al. showed that magnetic shielding promoted
cell cycle progression in the G1 phase of human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells
(Mo et al. 2013). Recently, we found that 1 T SMF could cause a mitotic arrest to
reduce cell number in synchronized HeLa cells (Luo et al. 2016).
On the other hand, most other studies found that the cell cycle was not affected
by SMFs. For example, in 2010 Hsu and Chang found that 0.29 T SMF did not
affect the cell cycle of dental pulp cells (Hsu and Chang 2010). Also in 2010,
Sarvestani et al. investigated the effects of a 15 mT SMF on cell cycle progression
in rat bone marrow stem cells (BMSC) and did not find any cell cycle changes
(Sarvestani et al. 2010). Recently we analyzed multiple cell types seeded at differ-
ent cell densities for the effects of 1 T SMF (Zhang et al. 2017b). For all the cell
lines we tested, 1 T SMF exposure for 2 days did not significantly affect the cell
cycle (Fig. 4.12) (Zhang et al. 2017b). In addition, we exposed human colon cancer
HCT116 cells and human nasopharyngeal cancer CNE-2Z cells to 9 T SMF for
three days and did not find noticeable cell cycle changes (our unpublished data).
Furthermore, we recently exposed CNE-2Z cells to an ultra-high 27 T SMF for 4 h
and did not observe obvious cell cycle changes (Fig. 4.13).
However, the effect of SMFs on cell cycle is likely to be cell type-dependent, just
like most other SMF-induced cellular effects. In 2010, Zhao et al. found that 13 T SMF
had no obvious effect on the cell cycle distribution in both Chinese hamster ovary

--- Page 117 ---

4.3 Cellular Effects of SMFs 111
Fig. 4.12 1 T SMF has minimal effects on cell cycle. Various cells were plated at different densi-
ties one day ahead and treated with 1 T SMF for 2 days before they were analyzed for cell
cycle by flow cytometry experiment. Experiments have been down for at least two times for each
cell line and representative quantification results are shown (Reprinted from ref. (Zhang et al.
2017b). Copyright © 2016 Impact Journals, LLC)
(CHO) cells or DNA double-strand break repair deficient mutant XRS-5 cells, but
decreased the G0/G1 phase and increased S phase cell percentage in human primary
skin AG1522 cells (Zhao et al. 2010). This indicates that maybe SMFs have more
effects on cell cycles in primary cells than immortalized cells. In addition, the specific
cell cycle changes SMFs induced are different in reported studies (Chen et al. 2010;
Zhao et al. 2010). More importantly, I think the methods people use make big differ-
ences. For example, flow cytometry (Figs. 4.12 and 4.13) could not reveal subtle
changes in G2 or M phase because G2 and M are combined together. Therefore, further

--- Page 118 ---

112 4 Impact of Static Magnetic Fields (SMFs) on Cells
Fig. 4.13 27 T ultra-high SMF does not have obvious effect on cell cycle of human CNE-2Z
cells in flow cytometry experiment. We recently exposed CNE-2Z cells to a 27 T ultra-strong
SMF for 4 h and did not observe obvious cell cycle changes (Zhang et al. 2017c). The 27 T Ultra-
strong SMF was provided by the water-cooled magnet #4 in Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei,
China, with a biological sample investigation platform. It provides accurate temperature, gas and
humidity for cell cultures (Figure was provided by Xinmiao Ji)
investigations with more methods are needed to examine more cell types and/or experi-
mental conditions for the exact effect of SMFs on cell cycle.
4.3.11 Chromosome and DNA
Due to the public health concerns about the power lines, mobile phones and cancer,
DNA integrity is frequently studied in pulsed magnetic fields (McCann et al. 1993;
Cridland et al. 1996; Olsson et al. 2001; Zhou et al. 2002; Williams et al. 2006;
Ruiz-Gomez et al. 2010). As early as 1984, Liboff et al. showed that DNA synthesis
in cells could be increased by time varying magnetic fields (Liboff et al. 1984).
Although so far there are still not enough evidences to confirm the harmful muta-
genesis effects of these pulsed magnetic fields on human bodies, more researches
are need to evaluate various exposure conditions.
In contrast, SMFs induced DNA damage and mutation is relatively less revealed. In
2004, Takashima et al. used somatic mutation and recombination test system in DNA
repair-proficient and -deficient strains of Drosophila melanogaster to test strong SMFs
for their possible effects on DNA damage and mutation in flies. They found that 2, 5,
or 14 T fields exposure for 24 h caused a statistically significant enhancement in
somatic recombination frequency in the postreplication repair-d eficient flies, whereas
the frequency remained unchanged in the nucleotide excision repair-deficient flies and
in the DNA repair-proficient flies after exposure. In addition, they found that exposure
to high magnetic fields induce somatic recombination in Drosophila and that the dose-
response relationship is not linear (Takashima et al. 2004). Other than this work in flies,

--- Page 119 ---

4.3 Cellular Effects of SMFs 113
most other studies revealed that SMFs do not cause DNA damage or mutation. For
example, in 2015, Reddig et al. found that exposure of unstimulated human mononu-
clear blood cells to 7 T SMF alone or combined with varying gradient magnetic fields
and pulsed radiofrequency fields did not induce DNA double-strand breaks (Reddig
et al. 2015). In 2016 Romeo et al. examined human foetal lung fibroblasts MRC-5
exposed to 370 mT SMF and found that the DNA integrity was not affected (Romeo
et al. 2016). Recently, Wang et al. exposed adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) to 0.5 T
SMF for seven days and did not observe DNA integrity changes (Wang et al. 2016).
Therefore these studies did not reveal the direct DNA damage. Interestingly, in 2014
Teodori et al. found that the DNA damage in primary glioblastoma cells cause by X ray
irradiation could be prevented by an 80 mT SMF exposure, which might because the
SMF prevented the mitochondria membrane potential loss caused by X-ray irradiation
(Teodori et al. 2014). So 80 mT SMF might have a protective role in X-ray induced
DNA damage. However, it was also shown that combining 10 T SMF with
X-ray-i rradiation could promote the micronucleus formation, although the 10 T SMF
itself does not have any effects on micronucleus formation (Nakahara et al. 2002).
It was reported that the DNA chain can be aligned by strong magnetic fields
because its relative large diamagnetic anisotropy (Maret et al. 1975), which is
mainly due to their stacked aromatic bases. In addition, it has been theoretically
predicted that the highly compacted mitotic chromosome arms can generate electro-
magnetic fields along the chromosome arm direction (Zhao and Zhan 2012) and
chromosomes should be able to be fully aligned by SMFs of around 1.4 T (Maret
1990). In addition, Andrews et al. showed that the isolated mitotic chromosomes
can be aligned by an electric field (Andrews et al. 1980). We recently found that a
27 T ultra-high SMF could affect the mitotic spindle orientation in human cells, in
which chromosomes played important roles (Zhang et al. 2017c).
The available evidences so far about SMF-induced DNA damage and mutation
are still not sufficient to a solid conclusion. Most studies revealed that SMFs do not
cause DNA damage or mutation in human cells. However, more investigations are
encouraged to examine different cell types and magnetic field intensities to help us
to achieve a more complete understanding on this issue.
4.3.12 Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)
Reactive oxygen species are highly active radicals, ions and molecules that have a
single unpaired electron in their outer shell of electrons. ROS includes free oxygen
radicals (O2•−, •OH, NO•, etc) and non-radical ROS (H2O2, N2O2, ROOH, HOCl
etc). It is well known that low levels of ROS can act as intracellular signaling mes-
sengers that oxidize protein thiol groups, modify protein structure and functions
while higher levels of ROS could nonspecifically attack proteins, lipids, and DNA
to disrupt normal cellular processes (Liou and Storz 2010; Shi et al. 2014). There
are also multiple studies showing that the elevated ROS levels in cancer cells com-
pared to normal cells could contribute to the cancer progression (Gao et al. 2007).
However, there are also some studies indicating that excessive oxidant stress slows

cancer cell proliferation, threatens their survival and therapeutic interventions to
further increase the oxidant stress level in newly formed tumor cells is likely to
make them prone to death (Schumacker 2006, 2015; Trachootham et al. 2006).
There are multiple studies showing that SMFs could increase the cellular ROS
(Table 4.3). For example, Calabro et al. showed that 2.2 mT SMF treatment for 24 h
significantly decreased mitochondria membrane potential and increased ROS level in
human SH-SY5Y neuronal-like cells (Calabro et al. 2013). De Nicola et al. found
that 6 mT SMF increased the intracellular ROS of human histiocytic lymphoma
U937 cells (De Nicola et al. 2006). In addition, Zhao et al. showed that ROS in the
three cell lines, human-hamster hybrid A(L) cells, mitochondria-deficient rho(0)
A(L) cells, and double-strand break (DSB) repair-deficient XRS-5 cells, were sig-
nificantly increased by 3 h exposure of 8.5 T SMF (Zhao et al. 2011). In the mean-
time, Martino and Castello showed that shielding the geomagnetic field (decrease
from 45–60 μT to 0.2–2 μT) could decrease the ROS production in human fibrosar-
coma cancer cell line HT1080, pancreatic AsPC-1 cancer cell line, and bovine pul-
monary artery endothelial cells (PAEC) (Martino and Castello 2011), which was
consistent with the observations in other reports that SMFs could increase ROS level.
However, there was also a study showing that ROS was not affected by SMFs.
Romeo et al. examined MRC-5 human lung fibroblasts exposed to 370 mT SMF and
found that the intracellular ROS level was not affected (Romeo et al. 2016). These
variations could be due to the cell type, magnetic field intensity, or even timepoint

--- Page 121 ---

4.3 Cellular Effects of SMFs 115
differences. For example, Sullivan et al. showed that the oxidant production
increased 37% in WI-38 cells exposed to SMF (230–250 mT) during the first 18 h
after seeding, but no change was observed after a prolonged 5-day exposure
(Sullivan et al. 2011), which indicates that the SMF-induced ROS elevation is time-
dependent. Furthermore, ROS was known to be different in different cell types, as
well as different cell densities (Limoli et al. 2004). We recently compared multiple
cell lines and found that 1 T SMF increased ROS levels in some cell types but not
the others. In some cell types, the ROS levels were even decreased by SMFs (our
unpublished data). The molecular mechanism and the relation between ROS level
changes and mitochondria alterations in SMF are still not clear. Further studies are
necessary to explore the mechanisms in more details.
4.3.13 Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)
Whether SMFs could affect the enzymatic ATP synthesis in vitro has been a big
debate in the literature. In 2008, Buchachenko and Kuznetsov reported magnetic
interactions on the rate of enzymatic synthesis of ATP in vitro (Buchachenko and
Kuznetsov 2008). They found that the ATP synthesis can be significantly
increased by 55 and 80 mT SMFs in the presence of 25Mg2+. However, later stud-
ies by Crotty et al. failed to reproduce their results (Crotty et al. 2012) and the
reason was still unclear (Hore 2012). Although the magnetic field intensities in
these two studies were almost identical, the experimental details about the mag-
net setup were provided by Crotty et al., but not by Buchachenko and Kuznetsov.
In addition, it is also possible that the difference was due to the fact that these
two groups have used different sources of proteins. Buchachenko and Kuznetsov
used a monomeric creatine kinase isozyme from snake venom, whereas Crotty
et al. used dimeric creatine kinase. To my point of view, the above mentioned
factors about both the magnetic fields and the protein itself could potentially
produce seemingly inconsistent results. Therefore more investigations are
encouraged to address this question.
Besides the in vitro studies, there are also some cellular works showing that the
ATP level in cells could be affected by SMFs. However, the exact effects also
seem to be case dependent. Back in 1995, Itegin et al. found that chronically
applied SMF of 0.02 T had differential effects on various ATPase. The mean activ-
ities of Na(+)-K+ ATPase and Ca2+ ATPase were significantly increased by SMF
but that of Mg2+ ATPase was non-significantly reduced (Itegin et al. 1995). It is
possible that different cells have different ATPase network so that their responses
to SMFs could be dissimilar. In 2010, Wang et al. tested moderate intensity SMF
(~0.25 T) on PC12 cells (derived from a pheochromocytoma of the rat adrenal
medulla) and found that the ATP level was moderately, but statistically signifi-
cantly increased (Fig. 4.14). There was another study by Kurzeja et al. that also
reported ATP level increase induced by SMF, although it was done in the presence
of fluoride. In 2013, Kurzeja et al. found that moderate intensity SMFs (0.4, 0.6,

and 0.7 T) could rescue fluoride-i nduced ATP decrease in fibroblasts. In addition,
the effect was magnetic field intensity- dependent, in which 0.7 T SMF produced
more significant effects than 0.4 and 0.6 T SMFs (Kurzeja et al. 2013).
There were also some studies showing that the cellular ATP level could be
reduced by SMFs in a magnetic field intensity- and cell type-dependent manner. For
example, in 2011, Zhao et al. used 8.5 T strong homogeneous SMF to test its effects
in three cell lines, including human-hamster hybrid A(L) cells, mitochondria-
deficient (rho(0) A(L)) cells, and double-strand break (DSB) repair-deficient (XRS-
5) cells. They found that SMF-induced ATP content change was magnetic field
intensity, time, as well as cell type-dependent (Zhao et al. 2011) (Table 4.4).
Moreover, their results indicated that the 8.5 T SMF-induced cellular ATP decrease
was partially mediated by mitochondria and the DNA DSB repair process because
the ATP level in wild type A(L) cells could recover 12–24 h after SMF exposure but
the mitochondria-deficient or double-strand break repair-deficient (XRS-5) cells
could not (Table 4.4) (Zhao et al. 2011).
4.3.14 Calcium
Calcium plays important roles in a number of biological systems, especially in sig-
nal transduction cascades. The magnetic field-induced calcium changes in cells
were mostly studied in PMFs (Walleczek and Budinger 1992; Barbier et al. 1996;
Tonini et al. 2001; Zhou et al. 2002; Fassina et al. 2006; Yan et al. 2010) and were
found to be dependent on cell status and field intensity (Walleczek and Budinger
1992) as well as other magnetic field parameters (Carson et al. 1990). There are
multiple studies showing the calcium level was increased by 50–60 Hz magnetic
fields (Barbier et al. 1996; Tonini et al. 2001; Fassina et al. 2006).
Similar to PMFs, there are also many studies showing that the calcium level
was increased by SMFs. For example, in 1998, Flipo et al. examined the in vitro

effects of 0.025–0.15 T SMFs on the cellular immune parameters of the C57BI/6
murine macrophages, spleen lymphocytes, and thymic cells (Flipo et al. 1998).
Exposure to the SMF for 24 h resulted in increased intracellular Ca2+ level in mac-
rophages and increased Ca2+ influx in concanavalin A-stimulated lymphocytes
(Flipo et al. 1998). In 2006, Tenuzzo et al. showed that 6 mT SMF could increase
the calcium level in multiple cell lines (Tenuzzo et al. 2006). Prina-Mello et al.
exposed rat cortical neurons to SMF of 0.75 T for 1 h and observed increased cal-
cium level (Prina-Mello et al. 2006). In 2009 Dini et al. found that 6 mT SMF could
cause significant increase in calcium level in human leukaemia U937 cells (Dini
et al. 2009). In 2010, Wang et al. found that 0.23–0.28 T SMFs could increase extra-
cellular calcium level in rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC12 cells (Wang et al.
2010) (Fig. 4.15a). In addition, they found that SMFs could antagonize CGS21680-
induced calcium reduction, which was similar to the effect of a selective A(2A)R
antagonist ZM241385 (Wang et al. 2010) (Fig. 4.15b). In the same year, Hsu and
Chang also found that 0.29 T SMF in combination with Dex/beta-GP significantly
increased the extracellular calcium concentration at the early stage, followed by
obvious calcium deposits later, which may contribute to the accelerated osteogenic
differentiation and mineralization of Dental pulp cells DPCs (Hsu and Chang 2010).
In 2014, Surma et al. found that weak SMFs increased the intracellular calcium and
accelerated the development of skeletal muscle cells from newborn Wistar rats in
primary culture (Surma et al. 2014). In the same year, Bernabo et al. showed that a
2 mT SMF could cause a reversible cell membrane depolarization wave (of about 1
min), which induced intracellular calcium increase and mitochondrial activity
decrease in vital granulosa cells (Bernabo et al. 2014).

4.3 Cellular Effects of SMFs 119
In the mean time, there are also some studies showing that the intracellular cal-
cium was not affected by SMFs. For example, in 1986 Bellossi exposed neonatal
isolated chick brains to uniform or nonuniform SMFs of 0.2–0.9 T and did not
observe calcium efflux changes (Bellossi 1986). Papatheofanis et al. exposed mice to
1 T SMF for 30 min/day for 10 days and did not observe calcium alteration
(Papatheofanis and Papatheofanis 1989). In 1990, Calson et al. found that 0.15 T
SMF did not affect the cytosolic calcium level in HL-60 cells (Carson et al. 1990). In
1992, Yost and Liburdy combined extremely low frequency (ELF) time-varying
magnetic fields with SMFs and examined their effects on calcium signaling in the
lymphocyte (Yost and Liburdy 1992). Their results showed that a 1 h exposure of
thymic lymphocytes to a 16 Hz, 42.1 μT magnetic field combined with a colinear
SMF of 23.4 μT inhibited calcium influx in mitogen-activated cells but not resting
lymphocytes. However, it was interesting that either the PMF or the SMF alone did
not have such effects (Yost and Liburdy 1992). In 2008, Belton et al. found that appli-
cation of 1, 10, or 100 mT SMF did not affect the calcium response to ATP in HL-60
cells (Belton et al. 2008). In 2009, Belton et al. and Rozanski et al. used a DEM to
deplete GSH in HL-60 cells and then examined their responses to 0.1 T SMF and did
not observe obvious calcium changes (Belton et al. 2009; Rozanski et al. 2009).
So far as we know, there are only a few studies that have reported the inhibition
effect of SMFs on calcium. In 1992, Yost and Liburdy found that a combination of
16 Hz, 42.1 μT PMF with 23.4 μT SMF could decrease calcium level in thymic
lymphocytes (Yost and Liburdy 1992). In 1996, Rosen et al. found that a 120 mT
SMF caused a minor reduction in the peak calcium current amplitude and shift in
the current-voltage relationship in cultured GH3 cells (Rosen 1996). In 2012, Li
et al. found that 5 mT SMF could decrease cytosolic free calcium concentration in
human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) (Li et al. 2012).
There are also many indirect evidences showing that calcium is involved in
SMF-induced cellular effects. For example, in 1990 a study using human polymor-
phonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) showed that 0.1 T SMF could induce degranulation
and cell migration inhibition, which could be prevented by pretreatment of calcium
channel antagonists diltiazem, nifedipine, and verapamil in dose-dependent manner
(Papatheofanis 1990). In 2005, Okano and Ohkuno found that neck exposure to 180
mT (B(max)) SMF alone for 5–8 weeks significantly suppressed or retarded the
development of hypertension together with increased baroreflex sensitivity (BRS)
in SMF group. Their results indicated that SMF may increase the L-type voltage-
gated calcium channel blocker nicardipine-induced hypotension by more effectively
antagonizing the Ca(2+) influx through the calcium channels compared with the
nicardipine injection (NIC) treatment alone (Okano and Ohkubo 2005). In 2006,
Ghibelli et al. found that 1 T SMF could potentiate the cytotoxic effects of puromy-
cin and VP16, which could be prevented by calcium chelating agents EGTA and
BAPTA-AM as well as the calcium channel blocker nifedipine (Ghibelli et al.
2006). In 2008, Yeh et al. found that 8 mT SMF increased the efficacy of synaptic-
transmission in crayfish tail-flip escape circuit in a calcium-dependent way (Yeh
et al. 2008). Also in 2008, Morris et al. used pharmacological agents for L-type
calcium channel to show that SMF-induced anti-edema effect may work through the
L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle cells (Morris and Skalak 2008).

120 4 Impact of Static Magnetic Fields (SMFs) on Cells
The differential effects of SMF-induced calcium changes are likely due to mul-
tiple reasons, such as cell types, magnetic field intensities as well as incubation
time. There are multiple studies indicating that different cell types have differential
calcium changes when exposed to SMFs. In 1999, Fanelli et al. found that the cal-
cium level in different cell types responded to 6 mT SMF differently, which seemed
to be correlated to the SMF-induced anti-apoptotic effect (Fanelli et al. 1999). They
further found that both the protective and potentiating effects of 6 mT and 1 T SMFs
in drug-treated cells were mediated by the Ca2+ influx from the extracellular medium,
which only happened in some cell types (Fanelli et al. 1999; Ghibelli et al. 2006). In
2003, Aldinucci et al. tested the effects of combining a 4.75 T SMF and a pulsed
EMF of 0.7 mT generated by an NMR apparatus for 1 h. They found that in Jurkat
leukemia cells the calcium level was reduced significantly after exposure (Aldinucci
et al. 2003b) but in normal or in PHA challenged lymphocytes the calcium level was
increased (Aldinucci et al. 2003a). In addition, the SMF-induced calcium changes
are also magnetic field intensity dependent. In 2006, Ghibelli et al. proposed that
both the anti-apoptotic effect of a 6 mT SMF and the potentiating effect of a 1 T
SMF were mediated by calcium influx (Ghibelli et al. 2006). In 2014, Zhang et al.
examined multiple mineral elements for MC3T3-E1 cells during osteoblast miner-
alization when they were exposed to 500 nT, control geomagnetic field (C-GMF),
0.2 T, and 16 T SMFs. They found that the calcium level was decreased by 500 nT
and 0.2 T SMFs but increased by the 16 T SMF (Zhang et al. 2014b). This magnetic
field intensity-induced difference may have contributed to some of the inconsisten-
cies in the literature, in addition to the cell type-induced variations. Moreover, the
SMF-induced calcium changes are also likely to be time-dependent. In 2005,
Chionna et al. found that Hep G2 cells exposed to 6 mT SMF had increased calcium
level in a time-dependent manner and it reached the highest level at 4 h (Chionna
et al. 2005). Table 4.5 summarizes the calcium changes induced by SMFs in the
literature (Table 4.5).
Since calcium plays crucial roles in cellular processes such as cell proliferation
as well as apoptosis, it is not surprising that different intensity SMFs could cause
differential effects on calcium levels in various cell types, which lead to totally
diverse cellular effects. In addition, there are also several studies that reported some
signal transduction pathway changes, which are probably due to, or at least partially
due to, the SMF-induced calcium modulation. For example, In 2012, Li et al. found
that 5 mT SMF could influence the proliferation, migration, and adhesion of human
umbilical artery smooth muscle cells (hUASMCs) by inhibiting the clustering of
integrin beta1, decreasing cytosolic free calcium concentration, and inactivating
FAK (Li et al. 2012). We previously found that 1 T SMF could inhibit human
CNE-2Z cancer cell proliferation, which was related to the EGFR-Akt-mTOR path-
ways (Zhang et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2016). As mentioned earlier in this chapter, we
found that EGFR and its downstream pathways likely contribute to the cell type-
and cell density-induced variations in SMF-induced cell proliferation changes
(Zhang et al. 2017b). In fact, the kinase activity of EGFR protein itself could be

Blue color indicates that SMF increases calcium level in cells. Grey color indicates that there is no
effect. Orange color indicates that SMF decreases calcium level in cells
directly inhibited by SMFs (Zhang et al. 2016), which will be further discussed in
Chap. 6. Recently, Lew et al. used 0.4 T SMF to treat dental pulp stem cells and
found that the cell proliferation rate was increased. Their results indicated that 0.4 T
SMF affected the cellular membranes of the DPSCs and activated intracellular cal-
cium ions, which may activate p38 MAPK signaling to reorganize the cytoskeleton
and increase cell proliferation of the DPSCs (Lew et al. 2016). Moreover, Maredziak
et al. showed that 0.5 T SMF increased the proliferation rate of human adipose-
derived mesenchymal stromal stem cells via activation of the phosphoinositide
3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway (Maredziak et al. 2017).

122 4 Impact of Static Magnetic Fields (SMFs) on Cells
4.4 Conclusion
Since the human body is composed of various cells, which are filled with various
components that can respond to the magnetic fields, most studies in the bioeffects of
magnetic fields are carried out at cellular level. The parameters of the magnetic
fields as well as the cells examined both have enormous impact on the experimental
outcomes. So far most cellular effects of SMFs are largely dependent on magnetic
field types, intensities, cell types, as well as other factors mentioned in this chapter.
The cellular effects not only include the above mentioned aspects such as cell orien-
tation, proliferation, calcium level changes, but also some other aspects that are
relatively less studied and not included in this chapter, such as gene expression,
mitochondria and immune system. It is obvious that further investigations are
needed to get a more complete understanding of the cellular effects of SMFs.
Overall, most cellular effects of SMFs are relative mild, except for the orientation
changes in strong SMFs. In our own lab, to get unbiased and reproducible results
throughout our studies, we always have at least two researchers to conduct the same
sets of experiments independently and gathered their results together for data analy-
sis. More importantly, people should know that the cellular effects of SMFs are
influenced by various factors and parameters of magnetic field and the cells, as well
as the way the experiments were done, such as incubation time and magnetic field
direction. In addition, the absence of magnetic field effects in some experiments
contrasted with the positive findings reported by other investigators. These discrep-
ancies may be attributable to an inadequate detection capacity of instrument or tech-
niques. Therefore, people should not only carefully record and analyze all
experimental factors, but also try to take advantages of the advanced modern tech-
nologies to get a more comprehensive understanding of the cellular effects of SMFs.

Chapter 5
Impact of Static Magnetic Field (SMF)
on Microorganisms, Plants and Animals
5.1 Introduction
Static magnetic field (SMF) is a ubiquitous environmental factor for all living
organisms during the evolutionary process. A variety of organisms including bacte-
ria, algae, snails, planaria, honey bees, salmon, lobsters, salamanders, homing
pigeons, robins, mice, and possibly humans have demonstrated the ability to sense
the magnetic field (MF) for orientation in navigation, migration, homing, escaping
and nest building (Gould 2010). Since the Industrial Revolution, human-made
sources of SMFs have become an inevitable environmental factor for living organ-
isms on the earth; in particular, the development of electromagnets and supercon-
ducting magnets made possible the exposure of organisms to intense magnetic
fields. Acute and chronic exposures of organisms to SMFs, which are often ten or
more times greater than geomagnetic fields, have been investigated for decades.
Several hypothesis have been proposed to explain the interaction of SMF with bio-
logical systems, including magnetic induction, magnetite hypothesis and radical
pair mechanism (Fedele et al. 2014). However, the exact mechanism(s) underlying
the influence of SMF on living systems is still largely unknown, and until recently
there was no unique theory about magnetic field-organism interaction. In this
review, we limit our discussion to the evidence on the impact of exposure to SMFs
with intensity ranging from a few mT to several Teslas (T) on microorganisms,
plants, and animals and explore recent key results in the investigation of magneto-
reception in these organisms.

134 5 Impact of Static Magnetic Field (SMF) on Microorganisms, Plants and Animals
5.2 SMF on Microorganisms
5.2.1 SMF on Cellular Growth and Viability
The influence of magnetic fields with various flux densities on the growth rate and
viability of microbes has been investigated in bacteria, yeast, and plant pathogenic
fungi. Moore (1979) found that SMF of 30–60 mT were most inhibitory on the
growth of several bacterial species. Bajpai et al. (2012) showed that SMF of 100 mT
suppressed growth of both gram-positive (S. epidermidis) and gram-negative bacte-
ria (E. coli), which was related to cellular membrane damage. Ji et al. (2009) showed
that a 450 mT SMF inhibited growth and even killed E. coli, and the inhibitory
effect increased with temperature. Morrow et al. (2007) investigated moderate SMF
in the range of 50–500 mT on the growth of Streptococcus pyogenes and observed
growth inhibition up to 300 mT, but an increase in growth rates when cells were
exposed to 500 mT. Although an SMF of 300 mT had no influence on the growth of
E. coli in nutrient rich Luria Bertani (LB) medium, it increased the density of bacte-
rial cells during late growth in diluted LB (Potenza et al. 2004). EI May et al. (2009)
also reported that SMF of 200 mT failed to alter cellular growth but induced a
decrease of colony-forming units (CFU) between 3 and 6 h followed by an increase
from 6 to 9 h. Kohno et al. (2000) compared the effect of SMF exposure of up to 100
mT on the culture of Streptococcus mutants (S. aureus) and E. coli grown in aerobic
and anaerobic conditions. They found that bacterial growth was inhibited by SMFs
in anaerobic conditions, but remained unaffected when applied in aerobic condi-
tions, indicating that oxygen played an inhibitory role for magnetic fields.
In contrast to the inhibition effects of SMF of mT on the growth of bacteria,
Nakamura et al. (1997) reported that the cellular growth of Bacillus subtilis MI113
and genetically transformed B. subtilis MI113 (pC112) significantly increased by
exposure to homogeneous 7 T and inhomogeneous 5.2–6.1 T magnetic fields.
Moreover, SMF of 5.2–6.1 T promoted survival rates of E. coli B cells in the station-
ary phase; CFU and the amount of S factor encoded by the rpoS gene were much
higher than that under a geomagnetic field (Horiuchi et al. 2001).
Growth and sporulation of phytopathogenic fungi have been investigated under
SMF. Nagy and Fischl (2004) showed that the applied magnetic field with flux den-
sities ranging from 0.1 to 1 mT decreased the growth of phytopathogenic fungi
colonies and the number of Fusarium oxysporum conidia, whereas the number of
the developed conidia of Alternaria alternata and Curvularia inaequalis increased.
Albertini et al. (2003) provided further evidence on the growth depression of fungi
exposed to SMFs. However, Ruiz-Gómez et al. (2004) demonstrated that magnetic
fields have no effect on fungal growth.
In yeast, Iwasaka et al. (2004) found that gradient magnetic fields of 14 T exhib-
ited decelerated growth in a liquid-gas mixture system (Fig. 5.1). Santos et al.
(2010) showed that SMF of 25 mT resulted in an increase in glutathione content and
biomass in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In contrast, Malko et al. (1994) reported that
yeast cells subjected to a static MF of 1.5 T over the course of seven cell divisions

5.2 SMF on Microorganisms 135
Fig. 5.1 Effects of magnetic fields of up to 14 T on the optical density of yeast suspension at
wavelength 600 nm. The optical densities of the pair of sample tubes were measured after static
incubation with and without exposure to magnetic fields. The upper panel shows the configuration
of magnetic force acting on the diamagnetic solution and yeast, the direction of gravity, and the
yeast culture tube. The bottom panel shows an example of the effects on the optical density of the
yeast suspension (Reprinted from Iwasaka et al. (2004), Copyright 2016, with permission from

displayed growth rates similar to unexposed cells. Muniz et al. (2007) reported that
the biomass (g/L) increment of Saccharomyces cerevisiae DAUFPE-1012 was 2.5
times greater in cultures exposed to a 200 mT SMF as compared with that in unex-
posed cultures.
5.2.2 SMF on Morphological and Biochemical Modifications
The morphological study of SMF-treated cells using a transmission electron micro-
scope (TEM) revealed that the bacterial cell wall was ruptured by SMF exposure (Ji
et al. 2009) (Fig. 5.2). SMFs of 200 mT significantly affected the phospholipid
proportions in S. typhimurium wild type and dam mutant strain, with the most
affected being the acidic phospholipids, cardiolipins (CL) (Mihoub et al. 2012).
Egami et al. (2010) investigated the effect of SMFs on the budding of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae and found that the size of budding yeast cells and the budding angle were
affected by SMFs of 2.93 T. In a homogeneous magnetic field, the budding direction
of daughter yeast cells was mainly oriented in the direction of magnetic field B; in
contrast, in an inhomogeneous magnetic field, the daughter yeast cells tended to bud
along the axis of capillary flow in regions where the magnetic gradient was high.
Microorganisms as models for analyzing fundamental metabolic responses to
magnetic fields have great advantages, as they represent simple unicellular organ-
isms. The inhibition of mycelia growth by SMF of 300 mT was accompanied by
morphological and biochemical changes and Ca2+-dependent signal transduction
pathways were involved in conidia germination (Albertini et al. 2003). The patterns
of metabolites released from S. pyogenes exposed to different magnetic flux

(f) images of SMFs-treated cells. The cell walls of untreated samples were complete while the cell
walls of SMFs-treated samples were obviously damaged (Reprinted from Ji et al. (2009), Copyright

densities ranging from 50 to 500 mT were significantly altered (Morrow et al. 2007).
SMFs of 250–300 mT elicited the maximal release of the majority of metabolites.
Hu and Qiu (2009) reported that an SMF of 10 T had significant effects on E. coli
compared with S. aureus, which was reflected by the changes of spectral region of
fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy combined with cluster analysis. The
composition and conformation of the nucleic acid, protein, and fatty acid of E. coli
were altered under the magnetic conditions. She et al. (2009) further found that
3.46–9.92% of the disorder coils in the secondary structures of protein in E. coli
were turned into a-helices under SMF.
5.2.3 SMF on Genotoxicity
Mahdi et al. (1994) exposed various mutant strains of E. coli to a homogeneous
static magnetic field of either 500 mT or 3 T. No evidence of increased DNA dam-
age was detected in SMF-exposed E. coli, even with bacterial strains disabled for
DNA repair. Ikehata et al. (1999) performed a bacterial mutation assay to determine
the mutagenic potential of SMF. No mutagenic effects were detected in four uvrB
strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537) and E. coli
WP2uvrA. Schreiber et al. (2001) also reported that exposures to an SMF of 7.2 T

--- Page 142 ---

5.2 SMF on Microorganisms 137
did not show any alteration in the number of His + revertants in Salmonella muta-
genicity test. Yoshie et al. (2012) reported that no statistically significant differences
in the mutation frequency in thymine synthesis genes were observed between SMF-
exposed cells and unexposed cells at any of the applied magnetic flux densities.
SMFs up to 13 T caused neither mutagenicity nor co-mutagenicity in the SOD-
deficient E. coli strain QC774 or in its parental strain GC4468, suggesting that
exposure to strong SMFs does not affect the behavior of superoxides in these
microorganisms.
The modification of chromatin conformation was reported in E. coli cells by
Belyaev and Alipov (2001). Zhang et al. (2003) showed a dose-response relation-
ship between the magnetic flux density (5 and 9 T SMF) and an increase in mutation
frequency in the superoxide dismutase (SOD)-deficient E. coli strain QC774.
Oxidative DNA damage plays an important role both in the aging process and envi-
ronmental stress related diseases. However, exposure of cells to 300 mT signifi-
cantly reduced the yield of 8-hydroxyguanine in extracted DNA compared to
controls, suggesting some possible anti-oxidant protection to S. pyogenes at this
field strength (Morrow et al. 2007). Carlioz and Touati (1986) showed an induction
of the expression of a soxS::lacZ fusion gene following strong SMF exposures.
5.2.4 SMF on Gene and Protein Expression
Tsuchiya et al. (1999) reported that inhomogeneous magnetic field ranging from 5.2
to 6.1 T enhanced the transcription of the rpoS gene in E. coli. Three cDNAs were
expressed only in E. coli exposed to 300 mT SMF, whereas one cDNA was expressed
more in the controls (Potenza et al. 2004). EI May et al. (2009) found that the
expression level of the 16S rRNA mRNA in Salmonella Hadar remained stable dur-
ing exposure to 200 mT SMF, whereas mRNAs of rpoA, katN, and dnaK genes were
over-expressed following 10 h of SMF exposure. Ikehata et al. (2003) reported that
a slight decrease in the expression of genes related to respiration was observed in
the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, exposed to 14 T SMF, whereas no
changes were observed with field strengths <5 T. Although 14.1 T SMF caused little
effects on cell growth of S. onedensis MR-1, apparent changes at transcriptional
levels were detected in exposed cells, in which 21 genes were upregulated and other
44 genes were downregulated (Gao et al. 2005). In contrast, Potenza et al. (2012)
reported that no differences were observed in gene expression in Tuber borchii
mycelium after exposure to SMF, and only the activities of glucose 6-phosphate
dehydrogenase and hexokinase were increased.
Snoussi and co-workers made a set of experiments on the out membrane protein
expression in S. Hadar exposed to SMF of 200 mT (Snoussi et al. 2012, 2016). They
found that a total of 11 proteins with more than a twofold change were differentially
expressed in S. Hadar exposed to SMF. Among these changed proteins, 7 were up-
regulated, while 4 were down-regulated. The proteomic analysis revealed that a
total of 35 cytosolic proteins, which 25 were upregulated and 10 were downregulated,

--- Page 143 ---

138 5 Impact of Static Magnetic Field (SMF) on Microorganisms, Plants and Animals
were differentially expressed in SMF-exposed S. Hadar. Moreover, the overexpres-
sion of stress response proteins were determined in SMF-exposed S. Hadar as well.
In other set of the experiments performed under the similar intensity of SMF,
Mihoub et al. (2012) observed significantly changes in lipid proportions of mem-
brane in exposed cells. SMF exposure caused an unusual accumulation of the acidic
phospholipids cardiolipins, which the cyclic fatty acids and the total unsaturated
fatty acids to total saturated fatty acids ratios were increased greatly.
5.2.5 Magnetosome Formation Sensing Magnetic Field
Microbial magnetosomes represent a special category of intracellular organelles
that are synthesized by magnetotactic bacteria (MTB), which are a group of Gram-
negative aquatic prokaryotes with a broad range of morphological types, including
vibrioid, coccoid, rod and spirillum. MTB use the magnetosomes to sense and
change their orientation in accordance with the magnetic field (Moisescu et al.
2014). Magnetosomes comprise magnetic iron-bearing inorganic crystals envel-
oped by an organic membrane (Staniland et al. 2007). Although the highly con-
trolled process of magnetosome synthesis is not fully elucidated, magnetosome
proteins are suggested to play an important role in biomineralization of magnetite
crystals and formation of magnetosome chain (Komeili et al. 2004; Peigneux et al.
2016). Most of magnetosome proteins are encoded by mam and mms genes located
in a conserved genomic region, known as magnetosome island (MAI), in
Magnetospirillum magneticum (AMB-1) and Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense
MSR-1 (MSR-1) (Matsunaga et al. 2005; Ullrich et al. 2005; Fukuda et al. 2006).
Among the various genes associated with magnetosome formation, the size and
shape of magnetite particles are controlled by mamCD and mms6, while magneto-
some biogenesis, magnetite biomineralization, magnetosome chain assembly, and
iron transport are regulated by mamAB cluster (Nakamura et al. 1995; Grunberg
et al. 2001; Amemiya et al. 2007; Komeili et al. 2004; Murat et al. 2010). Due to
their superior crystalline and magnetic properties, magnetosomes have shown great
prospect in biomineralization and medical applications, including drug delivery,
magnetic resonance imaging, and array-based assaying (Yoshino and Matsunaga
2006; Matsunaga et al. 2007; Barber-Zucker et al. 2016).
The investigation on the influence of SMF on MTB and magnetosome formation
is limited. Wang et al. (2008) found that exposure to SMF less than 500 nT restrained
the growth of M. magneticum strain AMB-1 during the stationary phase, but
increased the percentage of bacteria containing mature SD magnetosomes in their
exponential growth phase. The average size of magnetic particles in SMF exposed
cells was larger than 50 nm and a larger proportion of cells containing SD particles
as compared to those grown in the geomagnetic field only. An SMF of 200 mT could
impair cellular growth and raise Cmag values of the cultures. The number of mag-
netic particles per cell and the linearity of the magnetosome chain were affected by
SMF exposure, which the expression of the mamA, mms13, and magA genes were
up-regulated (Wang et al. 2009).

5.2 SMF on Microorganisms 139
5.2.6 Application of SMF on Antibiotic Resistance,
Fermentation and Wastewater Treatment
The application of SMF ranging from 0.5 ± 2 mT significantly enhanced the activity
of the antibiotic gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Benson et al. 1994).
Stansell et al. (2001) found that exposure of E. coli to SMF of 4.5 mT significantly
increased its antibiotic resistance. Tagourti et al. (2010) showed that exposure to a
200 mT SMF increased the efficiency of gentamicin against Salmonella Hadar but
did not affect the diameter of the inhibition zone of some other antibiotics actives on
Enterobacteria: penicillin, oxacillin, cephalotin, neomycin, amikacin, tetracyclin,
erythromycin, spiramycin, chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid and vancomycin.
However, Grosman et al. (1992) reported that static magnetic fields of 0.5 ± 4.0 T
had no significant influence on the growth of two strains of E. coli or Staphylococcus
aureus after exposure time of 30 ± 120 min, nor were there any effects on sensitivity
to several antibiotics.
The influence of SMF on the fermentation process has been investigated in bio-
mass and enzyme activity. da Motta et al. (2001, 2004) showed that exposure to a
220 mT SMF significantly increased the biomass (g/L) of S. cerevisiae strain 2.5-
fold and the concentration of ethanol by 3.4-fold as compared with SMF non-
exposed cultures. Glucose consumption was higher in magnetized cultures, which
correlated to the ethanol yield. Invertase is an enzyme (b-fructofuranosidase, EC
3.2.1.26) used to produce noncrystallizable sugar syrup from sucrose. Taskin et al.
(2013) showed that the maximum invertase activity and biomass concentration were
achieved with the spores exposed to 5 mT SMF.
Enhancement of biochemical processes by SMF has been applied in biological
wastewater treatment. Jung et al. (1993) proved that SMF of 450 mT increased the
efficiency of phenol biodegradation by 30% compared to the control sample.
Krzemieniewski et al. (2003) reported that SMF of 400–600 mT stimulated the
conditioning of wastewater sludge. Liu et al. (2008) found that a significant 30%
increase in maximum nitrogen removal rate and an approximate 1/4 saving in culti-
vation time were achieved using SMF of 60 mT, indicating that the magnetic field
was useful and reliable for fast start-up of the anammox process. Ji et al. (2010)
showed that SMF up to 20 mT has a positive effect on bacterial growth in activated
sludge and on wastewater biodegradation. Lebkowska et al. (2011) found that SMF
of 7 mT had a positive effect on activated sludge biomass growth and dehydroge-
nase activity, which was similar to the observation in pnitroaniline removal with
activated sludge. There was greater dehydrogenase and hydrolase activity in the
activated sludge in the SMF. SMF of 7 and 21 mT increased the efficiency of the
formation of polyhydroxybutyrate and the production of polyhydroxyvalerate,
respectively, in sequencing batch reactors under working conditions. Niu et al.
(2014) found that SMF intensity enhanced from 20 to 40 mT could promote micro-
organisms to produce more unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) to stimulate the TTC
dehydrogenase activity (TTC-DHA) in biological wastewater treatment. Křiklavová
et al. (2014) reported that short term repeated exposure to an SMF of 370 mT

--- Page 145 ---

140 5 Impact of Static Magnetic Field (SMF) on Microorganisms, Plants and Animals
stimulated substrate (phenol) oxidation by around 34%, which, in turn, promoted
Rhodococcus erythropolis growth by 28% while shortening the lag and exponential
phases and increasing bacterial respiration activity by 10%. This was consistent
with the observation that the degradation of phenolic waste liquors was enhanced by
submersed microorganisms at a MF intensity of 22 mT. In algal-bacterial symbiotic
system. Tu et al. (2015) reported that SMF stimulated both algal growth and oxygen
production, suggesting that magnetic field could reduce the energy consumption
required for aeration during the degradation of organic matter in municipal waste-
water. Tomska and Wolny (2008) showed that a MF of 40 mT increases the removal
of organic pollutants from wastewater, especially those containing nitrogen. Wang
et al. (2012) found that 48 mT magnetic field could enhance the activities and
growth of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB), suggesting that the magnetic field is
helpful and reliable for accelerating the aerobic nitrifying granulation. In contrast,
Mateescu et al. (2011) showed that SMF of 500 and 620 mT produced an atypical
growth of the fungus that was characterized by fewer and swollen, bombastic colo-
nies which did not spread on the entire surface of the culture medium. Filipic et al.
(2012) reported that SMF (B = 17 mT) negatively influenced the growth of E. coli
and Pseudomonas putida that are commonly found in wastewater treatment plants,
but positively influenced enzymatic activity.
5.3 SMF on Plants
5.3.1 SMF on Germination
Magnetic seed treatment is one of the physical presowing seed treatments that have
been reported to enhance the germination of crop plants. Martinez et al. (2000)
showed that germinating barley seeds subjected to a magnetic field of 125 mT
resulted in an increase in length and weight. Carbonell et al. (2009) reported that
chronic exposure to a 150 mT magnetic field significantly increased the rate and
percentage of germination in rice (Oryza sativa L.) seeds. Significant differences
were obtained for seeds exposed to a 250 mT magnetic field for 20 min. Vashisth
and Nagarajan (2008) showed that exposure of seeds of chickpea (Cicer arietinum
L.) to SMF with a strength from 0 to 250 mT in steps of 50 mT significantly
enhanced seed germination, speed of germination, seedling length and seedling dry
weight. Furthermore, treatment of sunflower seeds in these magnetic fields increased
the speed of germination, seedling length and seedling dry weight under laboratory
germination tests, due to the higher enzyme activities of α-amylase, dehydrogenase
and protease in magnetic field-treated sunflower seeds (Vashisth and Nagarajan
2010) (Fig. 5.3). Cakmak et al. (2010) found that SMF of 4 or 7 mT promoted the
germination ratios in both bean and wheat seeds. The greatest germination and
growth rates in both plants were from the test groups exposed to 7 mT MF. De
Souza et al. (2010) reported that various combinations of SMF strength and

Fig. 5.3 Effect of pre-germination exposure of sunflower seeds on (a) speed of germination and
(b) seedling vigor (Reprinted from Vashisth and Nagarajan (2010), Copyright 2016, with permis-
sion from Elsevier)
exposure time significantly improved tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) cv. Lignon
seed performance. The combinations of 160 mT for 1 min and 200 mT for 1 min
gave the best results. Naz et al. (2012) reported that pre-sowing magnetic treatments
with an average magnetic intensity of 99 mT significantly increased the germina-
tion, growth and yield of okra (Abelmoschus esculentus cv. Sapz pari). Iqbal et al.
(2012) reported that exposure of magnetic field strengths of 60 mT and 180 mT
significantly enhanced the germination parameters of the seeds of the garden pea
(Pisum sativum L. cv. climax), which the emergence index, final emergence index
and vigor index was increased by 86.43%, 13.21% and 204.60%, respectively.
Payez et al. (2013) reported that exposure to magnetic fields did not affect germina-
tion percent of the seeds, but increased the speed of germination and vigor index II,
compared to the control group. Poinapen et al. (2013) investigated the magnetic flux
density (R1 = 332.1 ± 37.8 mT; R2 = 108.7 ± 26.9 mT; and R3 = 50.6 ± 10.5 mT),
together with exposure time, seed orientation (North and South polarity), and rela-
tive humidity (RH) (7.0, 25.5, and 75.5%) in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) var.
MST/32 seeds. They found that higher germination (∼11.0%) was observed in
magnetically- exposed seeds than in non-exposed ones, suggesting a significant
effect of non-u niform SMFs on seed performance with respect to RH, and more
pronounced effects are observed during seed imbibition rather than during later
developmental stages. Mahajan and Pandey (2014) found that the impact of SMF
improved the germination of mung beans seeds even in off-season. Hozayn et al.
(2015) reported that the magnetic field of 30 or 60 mT increased all germination and
seedling growth characters in onion seeds (c.v.Giza Red) compared with control.

--- Page 147 ---

142 5 Impact of Static Magnetic Field (SMF) on Microorganisms, Plants and Animals
However, Flórez et al. (2004) reported that the mean germination time of rice
(Oryzasativa) seeds exposed to SMF of 125 or 250 mT was significantly reduced
compared to the controls.
5.3.2 SMF on Growth
Martinez et al. (2000) reported that MF of 125 mT stimulated the first stages of
growth of barley seeds and increases in length and weight were observed. De Souza
et al. (2006) showed that the mean fruit weight, the fruit yield per plant, the fruit
yield per area, and the equatorial diameter of fruits increased significantly in toma-
toes. Total dry matter was also significantly higher for plants from magnetically
treated seeds than controls. Flórez et al. (2007) reported that continuously exposure
to 125 or 250 mT MF produced corn plants that grew higher and heavier than the
control, corresponding with an increase of total fresh weight. Carbonell et al. (2011)
found that pea exposed to 125 or 250 mT SMF generated by magnets under labora-
tory conditions and continuous exposure were longer and heavier than the corre-
sponding control. Yano et al. (2001) reported that the primary roots of radish
(Raphanus sativus L.) seedlings responded tropically to the static magnetic field
with the tropism appearing to be negative and the roots responded significantly to
the south pole of the magnet. Subber et al. (2012) found that exposure to SMF of 50
mT significantly increased he root length, radicle length and protein percentage in
Zea mays. Vashisth and Nagarajan (2008) reported that a dramatic increase in root
length, root surface area and root volume was observed in chick pea exposed in
batches to SMF of strength from 0 to 250 mT in steps of 50 mT. In the same condi-
tions, sunflower seedlings showed higher seedling dry weight, root length, root sur-
face area and root volume. Moreover, in germinating seeds, enzyme activities of
α-amylase, dehydrogenase and protease were significantly higher in treated seeds
than controls (Vashisth and Nagarajan 2010).
5.3.3 SMF on Gravitropism
Gravitropism is the most conspicuous response to the gravitational force in plants,
which plays an essential role in maintaining the spatial orientation of seedlings and
stable balance of massive plants. The ability of plants to sense gravity is largely
attributed to starch-filled amyloplasts, which is a long-lived response throughout the
entire life cycle. Kuznetsov and Hasenstein (1996) reported that high-gradient mag-
netic fields (HGMFs) induced intracellular magnetophoresis of amyloplasts. The
shoots of lazy-2 mutants of tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill., cv. Ailsa
Craig) exhibited negative gravitropism in the dark, but responded positively gravit-
ropically in red light. The induced magnetophoretic curvature showed that lazy-2
mutants perceived the displacement of amyloplasts in a similar manner to the wild

--- Page 148 ---

5.3 SMF on Plants 143
type and the high MF did not affect the graviresponse mechanism (Hasenstein and
Kuznetsov 1999). Weise et al. (2000) reported that Arabidopsis stems positioned in
a high gradient magnetic field (HGMF) on a rotating clinostat showed a lack of api-
cal curvature after basal amyloplast displacement, indicating that gravity perception
in the base was not transmitted to the apex. Hasenstein et al. (2013) examined the
movement of starch grains of corn, wheat, and potato (Solanum tuberosum) in sus-
pension during parabolic flights and found that magnetic gradients were able to
move diamagnetic compounds under weightless or microgravity conditions and
serve as directional stimulus during seed germination in low-gravity environments.
Herranz et al. (2013) found that SMF itself produced a low number of proteomic
alterations, but the combination of gravitational alteration and SMF exposure pro-
duced synergistic effects on the proteome of plants.
5.3.4 SMF on Photosynthesis
The increase in agricultural output are closely related to the efficiency of photosyn-
thetic process. Shine et al. (2011) investigated the effects of SMF with magnetic
field intensity ranging from 0 to 300 mT on the seeds of soybean (Glycine max (L.)
Merr. var.: JS-335) and found that pre-sowing magnetic treatment could improve
biomass accumulation and a higher fluorescence yield at J–I–P phase polyphasic
chlorophyll a fluorescence (OJIP) transients was observed in exposed plants. Baghel
et al. (2016) reported that the fluorescence yield at J–I–P phase of OJIP transients
was increased in soybean seeds pretreated with 200 mT SMF under under salinity
stress, which the growth, biomass accumulation, and carbon and nitrogen metabo-
lism were enhanced in exposed plants as compare to controls. Anand et al. (2012)
reported that SMF of 100 and 200 mT increased the photosynthesis, stomatal con-
ductance and chlorophyll content in maize (Zea mays L.) var. Ganga Safed 2 seeds.
Jan et al. (2015) compared the effects of reduced and enhanced geomagnetic field
and SMF of 150 mT on the growth and efficiency of photosystem II in Lemna minor
plants. They found that although geomagnetic field had no effect on the efficiency
of photosystem II, 150 mT SMF had the potential to increase initial Chl a fluores-
cence and energy dissipation.
Yano et al. (2004) reported that CO uptake rate, dry weight, and the cotyledon
2
area of MF exposed radish seedlings was significantly lower than that of the control
seedlings. However, Iimoto et al. (1996) showed that SMF of up to 4 mT had benefi-
cial effects on the growth promotion and enhancement of CO uptake of potato
2
plantlets in vitro. In addition, Jovanic and Sarvan (2004) reported that SMF induced
significant changes in bean leaf fluorescence spectra and temperature. The
fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) and change of leaf temperature ßT increased with
MF intensity.

144 5 Impact of Static Magnetic Field (SMF) on Microorganisms, Plants and Animals
5.3.5 SMF on Redox Status
The uncoupling of free radicals including reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/
RNS) are involved in the underlying mechanism of SMF induced oxidative stress in
plants. The activities of free radical scavenging enzymes, including catalase (CAT),
superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione trans- ferase
(GT), peroxidase (POD), ascobtate peroxidase (APX), and polyphenoloxidase
(POP), have been well documented to be altered by SMF exposure in various plants,
including pea, radish (Raphanus sativus), Leymus chinensis, soybean, cucumber
(Cucumis stivus), broad bean, corn, parsley (Petroselinum crispum), and wheat
(Baby et al. 2011; Jouni et al. 2012). Cakmak et al. (2012) reported that SMF of 7
mT increased lipid peroxidation and HO levels in shallot (Allium ascalonicum)
2 2
leaves. Shine et al. (2012) showed that SMF of 150 and 200 mT enhanced produc-
tion of ROS mediated by cell wall peroxidase, while the increase in the cytosolic
peroxidase activity indicated that this antioxidant enzyme had a vital role in scav-
enging the increased HO produced in seedlings from the magnetically treated soy-
2 2
bean seeds. In mung bean seedlings treated with 600 mT SMF followed by cadmium
stress, Chen et al. (2011) found that the concentration of malondialdehyde, HO,
2 2
and O−. were decreased in seedlings treated with 600 mT magnetic field followed by
cadmium stress, while the NO concentration and NOS activity were increased com-
pared to cadmium stress alone, indicating that MF compensates for the toxicologi-
cal effects of cadmium exposure are related to NO signal.
5.3.6 Cryptochromes Sensing Magnetic Field
Cryptochromes (CRYs) are flavoproteins that direct a diverse array of developmen-
tal processes in response to blue light in plants (Yu et al. 2001). CRY has been sug-
gested to be a potential magnetoreceptor for light-initiated electron transfer
chemistry in CRY might be magnetically sensitive by virtue of the radical pair
mechanism (Hore and Mouritsen 2016; Evans et al. 2013). Geomagnetic field
(GMF) has been hypothesized to affect the redox balance of cryptochromes and the
related signaling state (Vanderstraeten et al. 2015); however, the influence of strong
SMF on the function of CRYs is still largely unexplored.
Three CRYs, CRY1, CRY2 and CRY3, are encoded in Arabidopsis genome (Lin
and Todo 2005). CRY1 and CRY2 function as major blue-light receptors regulating
blue light induced de-etiolation, photoperiodic flowering and circadian clock (Liu
et al. 2016). Xu et al. (2014) found that SMF of 500 μT modified the function of
CRYs. The blue light-dependent phosphorylations of CRY1 and CRY2 were
enhanced in Arabidopsis seedlings grown in a 500 μT MF, whereas the near-null
MF weakened the blue light-dependent phosphorylation of CRY2 but not CRY1. In
the darkness, dephosphorylations of CRY1 and CRY2 were slowed down in 500 μT

--- Page 150 ---

5.4 SMF on Animals 145
MF, whereas dephosphorylations of CRY1 and CRY2 were accelerated in the near-
null MF. According to the calculation of radical pair mechanisms in a relatively
realistic model of the radical-pair system in Arabidopsis CRY1, Solov’yov et al.
(2007) showed that 500 μT MF could increase the signaling activity of crypto-
chrome by up to 10%, suggesting that the function of CRYs was affected by mag-
netic fields. Ahmad et al. (2007) confirmed that 500 μT MF enhanced the blue
light-dependent inhibition of hypocotyl growth of Arabidopsis. Hypocotyl growth
of Arabidopsis mutants lacking cryptochromes was unaffected by the increase in
magnetic intensity, while cryptochrome-dependent responses, such as blue-light-
dependent anthocyanin accumulation and blue light dependent degradation of
CRY2 protein, were enhanced at the higher magnetic intensity. However, with
experimental conditions chosen to match Ahmad’s study, Harris et al. (2009) found
that in no case consistent, statistically significant MF responses were detected.
In addition to plants, the expression of CRYs has been detected in insects and
vertebrate animals with distinct circadian clock functions (Möller et al. 2004;
Nießner et al. 2013). In Drosophila, CRYs act as circadian photoreceptors accord-
ing to the light and dark changes; in contrast, in vertebrates, CRYs act as transcrip-
tional repressors in regulating the circadian feedback loop (Michael et al. 2017).
Non-drosophilid insects such as butterfly have two types of CRYs: one act like
Drosophila-CRY with light-sensing properties, whereas the other act like vertebrate-
CRY with transcriptional repressive properties. Marley et al. (2014) reported that
MF exposure coupled with blue light pulses had a substantial effect on seizure
response in Drosophila larvae, which was dependent on CRYs. Giachello et al.
(2016) provided new evidence that MF of 100 mT could increase neuronal action by
stimulating the activity of CRY, indicating the link between magnetoreception and
neuronal activity.
5.4 SMF on Animals
5.4.1 SMF on Caenorhabditis elegans
Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is a small free-living nematode. Due to the
availability of the whole genome sequence, C. elegans has been widely used in
studying fundamental issues of evolution, development, neurobiology, and genetics
(Kaletta and Hengartner, 2006; Boyd et al. 2010). The unique advantages of C.
elegans include the ease of maintenance, small size, short life cycle, genetic manip-
ulability, stereotypical development, and high-throughput capability. Since 40–60%
of its genes have human homologs, C. elegans based assays have been considered
as an alternative to mammalian models in evaluating potential toxicity of physical
and chemical mutagens and carcinogenes in humans (Dengg and van Meel 2004;
Rajini et al. 2008; Sprando et al. 2009).

146 5 Impact of Static Magnetic Field (SMF) on Microorganisms, Plants and Animals
C. elegans has a simple nervous system with only 302 neurons in hermaphro-
dites. Vidal-Gadea et al. (2015) reported that AFD neurons, which sense environ-
mental temperature and chemical stress, played a critical role in the orientation of
C. elegans to geomagnetic field. Mutated stains, tax-4 gene, which encodes an ion
channel protein with similar function as a photoreceptor, was identified for mag-
netotaxis by using mutated strains. Rankin and Lin (2015) highlighted the signifi-
cance of this study for it provided novel information on the navigation of living
organisms sensing geomagnetic field.
The biological effects of SMFs on C. elegans have focused on aging and devel-
opment, behavior, and global gene expression. Hung et al. (2010) reported that the
development time and average lifespan were greatly reduced in wild-type nema-
todes exposed 200 mT SMF, which were related to the upregulation of lim-7, clk-1,
daf-2, unc-3 and age-1. Lee et al. (2012) screened 120 randomly selected genes in
response to SMF exposure ranging from 0 to 200 mT and identified 26 differentially
expressed genes that were related to apoptosis, oxidative stress, and cancer. The
behavioral decline induced by SMF was suppressed in ced-3, ced-4, and ced-9
mutants, indicating the involvement of key apoptotic pathway. Kimura et al. (2008)
reported that SMF of 3 or 5 T significantly and transiently altered global gene
expression in C. elegans, especially the upregulation of motor activity, cytoskeleton,
actin binding, cell adhesion, Ca2+ binding, and cuticle related genes were found in
SMF exposed nematodes. Wang et al. (2015) found that there was a time-dependent
lifespan decrease and alteration of developmental pattern in C. elegans exposed to
8.5 T SMFs (Fig. 5.4). Furthermore, SMF exposure significantly increased germ
cell apoptosis, which was mediated by apoptotic key signaling pathway and the
generation of free radicals.
5.4.2 SMF on Insects
Magnetic fields have been shown to affect the orientation, oviposition development,
fecundity, and behaviour for a wide variety of insects. The insect eggs have advan-
tages in magnetic exposure as a large number of eggs can be placed into the magnet
at the same time. The static magnetic field at 4.5 mT had no effect on egg lying, but
increased mortality of eggs, larvae, and pupa, and diminished adult viability in
Drosophila (Ramirez et al. 1983). Decreased hatching rate after exposure to a weak
static magnetic field during early embryogenesis was also obtained in D. melano-
gaster and Heliothis virescens (tobacco bugworm) (Ho et al. 1992; Pan 1996).
Apparent hatching delay from strong magnetic fields were observed in mosquito
eggs in the center of 9.4 and 14.1 T magnets (Pan and Liu 2004). A significant
increase of Hylotrupes bajulus viability and larval mass was reported after exposure
to SMF of 98 mT (Rauš et al. 2009). A static magnetic field of 60 mT reduces the
embryonic and post-embryonic development, and induces weaker viability in two
different species, Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila hydei (Savic et al.

5.4 SMF on Animals 147

times on lifespan of C. elegans. Left: Lifespan of C. elegans hatching from eggs exposed to 5 T
SMF for 1, 3, 5 h. Right: Lifespan of C. elegans hatching from eggs exposed to 8.5 T SMF for 1,
3, 5 h. At least 60 worms were scored for each group
2011). Oak and beech populations of Drosophila subobscura had a longer develop-
ment time and lower viability was observed in in N and S groups of 2.4 T SMF,
which was mediated by oxidative stress (Todorovic et al. 2015).
In insects, the neuro-endocrine system is a main regulator of all aspects of life
processes, such as development and behaviour, and the detection and activity of an
external magnetic field may be transmitted by the neuroendocrine system. SMF of
375 mT caused a disturbance in the development and survival of pupae of the hon-
eybee and Tenebrio molitor, the yellow mealworm (Prolic and Jovanovic 1986,
Prolic and Nenadovic 1995). The morphometric parameters of the A1 and A2’ neu-
rosecretory neurons of the protocerebrum as well as the morphometric parameters
of the corpora allata were changed by SMF of 320 mT (Peric-Mataruga et al. 2006,
2008). However, SMF of 50 mT had no effect on the pupa-adult development
dynamic of two examine Tenebrio species, but they did modulated their motor
behaviour (Todorovic et al. 2013).

148 5 Impact of Static Magnetic Field (SMF) on Microorganisms, Plants and Animals
The antennal lobe of Drosophila provides an ideal intact neural network model
to investigate neural circuit function (Ng et al. 2002). Yang et al. (2011) found that
SMF of 3.0 T modulated the rhythmic spontaneous activities of large LNs and cor-
related activity of ipsilateral pairs of large LN/LN in the Drosophila antennal lobe,
indicating that Drosophila can be an ideal intact neural circuit model to evaluate the
effects of magnetic field stimulations.
Mutagenic effects of a static magnetic field were investigated by increased muta-
tion rate in a population of Drosophila exposed to a magnetic field 10–12 times
greater than a geomagnetic one (Giorgi et al. 1992). Exposure to 2, 5, or 14 T fields
caused a statistically significant enhancement in somatic recombination frequency
in the post-replication repair-deficient flies, whereas the frequency of somatic
recombination remained unchanged in the nucleotide excision repair-deficient flies
and in DNA repair-proficient flies after exposure (Takashima et al. 2004).
5.4.3 SMF on Helix pomatia
Helix pomatia possess a simple nerve system and display simple behavioral reper-
toire. Single identified neurons have been documented as a good experimental
model for the relatively large size, easy manipulation, consistent position on the
surface of the ganglia, and consistent type of synaptic connections. Nikolic et al.
(2008)reported that the magnetic field of 2.7 mT intensity caused changes in the
amplitude and duration of the action potential of the Br neuron in in subesophageal
ganglia of the garden snail Helix pomatia, whereas the 10 mT magnetic field
changed the resting potential, amplitude spike, firing frequency, and duration of the
action potential. Moreover, a significant increase of the activity of Na+/K+-ATPase
and the expression of its α-subunit in the nervous system was observed in Helix
pomatia exposed to 10 mT SMF (Nikolic et al. 2012, 2013). With single, 30-min
long, and whole body exposure to 147 mT, Hernadi and Laszlo (2014) reported that
SMF-exposure mediated the peripheral thermal nociceptive threshold by affecting
the serotonerg as well as the opioiderg system.
5.4.4 SMF on Aquatic Animals
Sea urchins are the only invertebrates having development patterns similar to those
of mammals. Moreover, the gametes of sea urchins can be obtained easily, the eggs
and early embryos are transparent, and the early development of embryos is highly
synchronous. SMF of 30 mT delayed the onset of mitosis in two species of sea
urchins, Lytechinus pictus and Strongylocentrotus purpurattus. There was an eight-
fold increase in the incidence of exogasturlation in L. pictus embryos exposed to
SMF, while magnetic fields had no effects on S. purpurattus embryos (Levin and

--- Page 154 ---

Ernst 1997). Exposure of fertilized eggs of Echinometra mathaei to 30, 40, and 50
mT magnetic fields delayed the onset of early cleavage division and significantly
decreased the cleaved cells for exposed embryos. As the intensity of the magnetic
field increased, earlier appearances of abnormalities were observed (Sakhnini and
Dairi 2004).
The interaction among neurons in the escape circuit of crayfish has been well
studied. Since the lateral giant (LG) neuron is easy to access for electrophysilogical
study, Ye et al. (2004) found that exposure to SMF at 4.74–43.45 mT increased the
amplitude of action potential (AP) in LG depending upon both the intensity of field
and duration of field exposure, which was mediated by the increasing level of intra-
cellular Ca2+ in the LG. The excitatory post synaptic potential (EPSP) produced via
electrical and chemical synapses in the lateral giant neuron were enhanced after
30 min of SMF exposure (8.08 mT). Perfusion of field-exposed crayfish bath solu-
tion or preloading of Ca2+ chelator and intracellular Ca2+ release blocker failed to
observe the SMF-induced enhancement on EPSP (Yeh et al. 2008).
As an increasingly important model species in genetic and neurobehavioral stud-
ies, zebrafish (Danio rerio) are an excellent organism for better understanding the
biological mechanism of SMF. Using a fast, fully automated assay system relying
on negative reinforcement, Shcherbakov et al. (2005) recorded statistically highly
significant reactions to weak magnetic field changes in Mozambique tilapia, a fish
migrating regularly between freshwater and the sea, and non-migratory zebrafish.
Takebe et al. (2012) found that zebrafish responded to a magnetic field as weak as
the geomagnetic field by bidirectional orientation with group-specific preferences
regardless of close kinships. SMF with density from 4.7 to 11.7 T profoundly dis-
turb the orientation and locomotion behaviors of adult zebrafish, and the indepen-
dence of these effects from other sensory modalities suggests that they are mediated
by the vestibular system (Ward et al. 2014) (Fig. 5.5). In addition, the static mag-
netic fields could be disrupting metabolism and immunity of the Caspian kutum fry
during acute and subacute exposures (Loghmannia et al. 2015).
5.4.5 SMF on Xenopus laevis
Xenopus embryos are thought to be a useful tool for studying vertebrate develop-
ment and gene expression for their embryogenesis is rapid and completed outside of
the female. The hatching rate of embryos of the frog Rana pipiens subjected to the
field of a 1 T permanent magnet was reduced (Neurath 1968). Ueno et al. (1984)
investigated embryos of African clawed toads exposed to 1 T magnetic fields and
found that the magnetic field exerted no harmful or modifying effects on gastrula-
tion and neurulation; however, exposed embryos occasionally resulted tadpoles
with reduced pigmentation, axial anomalies, or microcephaly. Compared to the first
and the second cleavage, the third cleavage was the most susceptible to reorientation
in a strong, static magnetic field. Exposure to SMF at 16.7 T altered the direction of

the third cleavage furrow from its normal horizontal type to the perpendicular type,
which was confirmed by embryos exposed to 8 T (Denegre et al. 1998; Eguchi et al.
2006). These results indicated that SMF act directly on the microtubules of the
mitotic apparatus to cause distortion of the third cleavage furrow (Fig. 5.6).
Kawakami et al. (2006) found that SMF of 11–15 T significantly retarded normal
development and induced microcephaly, two heads, abnormal cement glands and
multiple malformations. Moreover, the gene expression of Xotx2 (an important reg-
ulator of fore and midbrain morphogenesis) and Xag1 (essential for cement gland

the embryo rotated under 8 T. Note that the third cleavage furrows are all horizontal in the four
blastomeres and rotated embryos without magnetic field tended to have larger animal blastomeres
and rotated embryos with magnetic field tended to have smaller blastomeres compared to the con-
trol embryos (Reprinted from Eguchi et al. (2006), Copyright 2016, with permission from John

formation) was greatly suppressed by strong SMF. Mietchen et al. (2005) investi-
gated the morphology of fertilizable Xenopus laevis eggs with and without a jelly
coat that were subjected to static magnetic fields of up to 9.4 T and found that no
effect was observed when the jelly layers of the eggs were left intact, indicating the
action of magnetic fields might involve cortical pigments or associated cytoskeletal
structures normally held in place by the jelly layers.
The influence of SMF on nerve system have investigated in frog sciatic nerves.
Edelman et al. (1979) placed the magnetic field around the axis of the nerve fibers
and found that the amplitude of CAP in frog sciatic nerves was significantly
increased by SMF of 385 or 600 mT. Although 8 T SMF had no effect on NCV of
CAP, Eguchi et al. (2003) found that SMF altered the membrane excitation during
the recovery process, which was mediated by the activation of ion channels. Satow
et al. (1990, 2001) found that spatially homogeneous SMF of 0.65 T enhanced the
excitability of bullfrog sartorius muscle during the recovery process. Okano et al.
(2012) found that the nerve conduction velocity of C fibers were significantly
reduced by 0.7 T SMF, instead of 0.21 T SMF.

5.4.6 SMF on Mice and Rats
5.4.6.1 SMF on Bone Growth, Healing and Loss
SMF has been utilized as a physical therapy option for bone health maintenance and
treatment of bone disorders, since it can enhance bone fracture healing and forma-
tion by osteoblasts both in vivo and in vitro (Miyakoshi 2005; Saunders 2005; Trock
2000). With the implantation of magnetized rods into the middle diaphysis of rat
femurs, Yan et al. (1998) found that the bone mineral density (BMD) and calcium
content was significantly increased by SMF in the femurs adjacent to magnetized
specimens as compared to unmagnetized specimen. With an ischemic rat femur
model, Xu et al. (2001) found that bone weights were significantly increased in
magnetized group as compared to unmagnetized one, which might be related to the
improved blood circulation of the femur. Furthermore, SMF of 180 mT increased
BMD of osteoporotic lumbar vertebrae in the ovariectomized rats (Xu et al. 2011).
Kotani et al. (2002) showed that 8 T SMF stimulated ectopic bone formation, which
was orientated parallel to the magnetic field, in mice implanted by bone morphoge-
netic protein (BMP) 2-containing pellets. Taniguchi et al. (2004) found that pain
relief by SMF in mice rats with adjuvant arthritis adjuvant was attributed to the
increased blood circulation, locomotor activity and BMD. In an ovariectomized
(OVX) rat model, Taniguchi and Kanai (2007) that locomotor activity and BMD
was increased by SMF. Yun et al. (2016) reported that SMF significantly enhanced
the new bone formation in mouse calvarium implanted with magnetic scaffolds.
5.4.6.2 SMF on Cardiovascular System
Blood Pressure and Blood Flow
SMF in the mT range has been reported to modulate circulatory hemodynamics
and/or arterial blood pressure (BP) and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) (Okano and
Ohkubo 2003, 2006; Morris and Skalak 2005). Okano et al. (2005) found that whole
body exposure to SMF at 10 mT and 25 mT suppressed and delayed BP elevation in
young, stoke resistant, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), which was mediated
by nitric oxide (NO) pathway and hormonal regulatory systems. SMF up to 180 mT
enhanced nicardipine (NIC, an L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel blocker)-induced
hypertension remarkably via more efficiently antagonizing the Ca2+ flux through the
Ca2+ channels, which partially relate to the increase of NO metabolites. Continuous
neck exposure to 12 mT SMF for at least 2 weeks either depressed or suppressed
sympathetic agonists-induced hypertension, hemodynamics, and behavioral
changes by modulating sympathetic nerve activity in Wistar rats (Okano and
Ohkubo 2007).

--- Page 158 ---

5.4 SMF on Animals 153
It is well known that surface temperature and cutaneous blood flow closely paral-
lel each other. Ichioka et al. (2003, 2000) reported that the whole body exposure of
anesthetized rats to 8 T SMF was associated with reduced skin blood flow and tem-
perature, which recovered after removal of the animal from the magnet. Both
increases and decreases in skin and rectal temperatures were observed in mice
exposed to SMF with intensities ranging from 0.4 to 8 T. In contrast to these obser-
vations, no evidence of a change in body temperature was found in rodents exposed
to strong homogeneous or gradient magnetic fields (Tenforde 1986).
Cardiac Function
Blood flow in an applied magnetic field gives rise to induced voltages in the aorta
and other major arteries of the central circulatory system, which can be observed as
superimposed electrical signals in the electrocardiogram (ECG). The largest mag-
netically induced voltage occurs during pulsatile blood flow into the aorta, and
results in an increased signal at the location of the T-wave in the ECG. Beischer and
Knepton (1964) and Togawa et al. (1967) observed a marked increased T wave in
the ECG records during exposure of squirrel monkeys to stationary fields of 2–7 T
and rabbits exposed to 1 T SMF. A similar observation by Gaffey and Tenforde
(1981) reported that a field strength dependent increase in the amplitude of the
T-wave signal in the rat ECG was revealed during exposure to homogeneous sta-
tionary magnetic fields of 2 T, which might be due to a superimposed electrical
potential generated by aortic blood flow in the presence of a stationary magnetic
field. Morris and Skalak (2005, 2007)quantified the effect of localized SMF expo-
sure on the diameter of microvessels in adult rat skeletal muscle in vivo and found
that uniform 70 mT SMF altered arteriolar blood vessel diameter, while chronic
SMF exposure altered the adaptive microvascular remodeling response to mechani-
cal injury. The exposure of rats to SMF of 128 mT decreased the activities of gluta-
thione peroxidase (GPx) and the superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) in rat cardiac
muscle (Amara et al. 2009).
Hematological Parameters
SMF is known to be lipolytic and glycogenolytic in rats. Sub-acute exposure to
SMF of 128 mT stimulated the biosynthesis of plasma corticosterone and metallo-
thionein activities in female rats (Chater et al. 2004). Moreover, 128 mT SMF
increased blood glucose and decreased insulin release, leading to a diabetic-like
state in pregnant rats (Chater et al. 2006a, b). Elferchichi et al. (2010) showed that
an impaired glucose homeostasis and a deregulated lipid metabolism after SMF
exposure in adult rats. Recent evidence suggested that supplementation with vita-
min D corrected and restored glycemia and insulinemia in SMF-exposed rats
(Lahbib et al. 2015a, b). Amara et al. (2006a, b) reported that SMF of 128 mT sig-
nificantly decreased growth rates, but increased the plasmatic total protein levels,

154 5 Impact of Static Magnetic Field (SMF) on Microorganisms, Plants and Animals
hemoglobin, red blood cells, white blood cells, platelet number, and the activities of
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine ami-
notransferase (ALT) in male Wistar rats; in contrast, the glucose concentration was
unaffected. A further study showed that selenium (Se) improved adverse oxidative
stress in blood induced by SMF, whereas zinc supplementation could prevent toxic
effects of SMF probably by its anti-oxidant proprieties (Ghodbane et al. 2011a, b).
Atef et al. (1995) investigated changes of hemoglobin (Hb) characteristics in Swiss
mice using hundreds of mT for 10 min and found that the rate of the Hb oxidative
reaction declined at 350–400 mT. Elferchichi et al. (2016) noticed that SMF of 128
mT induced a pseudoanemia status with increased monocarboxylate transporters
(MCT4) and glucose transporter 4 (Glut4). However, Djordjevich et al. (2012)
found that differently oriented SMF of 16 mT did not alter hemoglobin and hema-
tocrit, although the upward and downward fields caused statistically significant
higher levels of serum transferrin. Milovanovich et al. (2016) showed that both
upward- and downward-oriented SMF of 128 mT caused a reduction in the amount
of total white blood cells (WBC).
5.4.6.3 SMF on Digestive System
An SMF of 128 mT increased total GSH levels and the activity of superoxide dis-
mutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and hepatocyte apoptosis in rat liver through a
caspase-independent pathway involving mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor
(AIF), which was restored by selenium and vitamin E supplementations (Ghodbane
et al. 2011a, b, 2015). Amara et al. (2007, 2009) reported that exposure of rats to
SMF of 128 mT increased the 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo)
concentration in the kidney, while this biomarker of DNA oxidation remained unaf-
fected in the liver and brain, which was in consistent with the observation of Chater
et al. (2006a, b).
5.4.6.4 SMF on Endocrine System
Static magnetic field (SMF) therapy, an inexpensive and accessible noninvasive
method, has proven to be effective on various tissue repairs, such as fresh and non-
union fracture, skin wounds, ulcer, and nerve injury. Jing et al. (2010) found that 180
mT SMF exposure could significantly accelerate the diabetic wound (DW) closure
process and enhance the wound tensile strength (TS); however, 180 mT local SMF
exposure had no effect on insulin secretion or pancreatic cells of diabetic rats
(Rosmalen et al. 2002). László et al. (2011) provided further evidence that daily SMF
exposure repeated for several weeks was protective against the development of high
blood glucose levels in diabetic mice. Lahbib et al. (2010, 2015a, b) showed that
exposure to SMF of 128 mT induced an increase in plasma glucose level and a
decrease in the plasma insulin concentration in rats, which could be corrected by
vitamin D supplementation. Moreover, β cell insulin content, the expression of

--- Page 160 ---

5.4 SMF on Animals 155
glucose transporter GLUT2 and islet area were lower in SMF-exposed group com-
pared to the control. Elferchichi et al. (2011) showed that the metabolic alterations
following exposure to a SMF of moderate intensity could trigger the development of
a pre-diabetic state. In addition, Abdelmelek et al. (2006) reported that SMF of 128
mT induced an increase in norepinephrine content in rat gastrocnemius muscle.
5.4.6.5 SMF on Lymphatic System
Bellossi (1986) showed that the lifetime was prolonged significantly by uniform
SMF of 600 or 800 mT in female AKR mice, which develop spontaneous lympho-
blastic leukaemia. Yang et al. (2009) observed that SMF of 200–400 mT prolonged
the average lifetime of mice bearing L1210 leukemia cells and increased the spleen
and thymus index in normal mice. Milovanovich et al. (2016) reported that SMF of
128 mT caused a reduction in the amount of lymphocytes in serum and a decrease
of granulocytes in the spleen, kidney inflammation, a specific redistribution of pro-
inflammatory cells in blood and various organs. De Luka et al. (2016) showed that
SMF of 1 mT reduced the content of zinc in mouse spleen, while the copper amount
remained unchanged.
5.4.6.6 SMF on Nervous System
The nervous system, including the brain, spiral cord, and neurons, is important tar-
get of magnetic field. SMF exposure had a strong modulatory effect on cell hydra-
tion in different tissues of rats including brain tissue. Deghoyan et al. (2014)showed
that the initial state of tissue hydration could play a crucial role in animal age-
dependent magnetic sensitivity, which could be an age-dependent dysfunction of
Na+/K+ pump. Kristofiková et al. (2005) showed functional teratogenic risks of the
alterations in the orientation of 140 mT SMF for postnatal brain development and
functional specialization of both hippocampi in rats. Whole-body SMF exposure
and local SMF exposure on the spine resulted in practically identical ear thicknesses
and significant effects of the SMF may involve a lower spinal response to exposure
(Gyires et al. 2008). Kiss et al. (2015) showed that local SMF exposure on the spine
affected ear thickness, indicating that the place of local SMF action may be in the
lower spinal region. Veliks et al. (2004) investigated the influence of 100 mT SMF
on autonomic nervous system in rat brain by evaluating heart rate and rhythmicity
and found that the effectiveness of SMF in large measure depended on both func-
tional peculiarities and functional activities of brain autonomic centers. The activa-
tion of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extra cellular-regulated kinase (ERK)
were significantly increased in primary cortical neuron exposed to magnetic field up
to 5 T (Prina-Mello et al. 2006). The content of calcium and iron was raised sharply
in rats spinal cord by exposure to 128 mT SMF, whereas magnesium and copper
levels remained unchanged (Miryam et al. 2010). Sub-acute exposure to SMF
altered the antioxidant response by decreasing the level of total selenium in rat brain

156 5 Impact of Static Magnetic Field (SMF) on Microorganisms, Plants and Animals
(Ghodbane et al. 2011a, b). Exposure to SMF of 1 mT increased the amount of zinc
in mouse brain, while copper levels were decreased (De Luka et al. 2016).
Behavioral effects are essential response of nervous system function. Exposure
to 128 mT SMF not only altered emotional behaviour of rats in the plus maze and
long-term spatial memory, but also led to cognitive impairments or at least to sub-
stantial attention disorders in the Morris water maze (Ammari et al. 2008; Maaroufi
et al. 2013). This showed that SMF exposure had no massive effect but affected
long-term spatial memory. Weiss et al. (1992) confirmed that acute behavioral and
neural effects on rats became apparent at 4 T in a simple T-maze study. A 30 min
exposure of rats to a 9.4 T superconducting magnet induced tight circling locomotor
activity, conditioned taste aversion (CTA), and the express of c-Fos in specific ves-
tibular and visceral nuclei within the brainstem (Nolte et al. 1998; Snyder et al.
2000). Houpt et al. (2007, 2011, 2012) extended the studies on the relationship
betwen rat behavior and an SMF of 7 or 14 T and found that depressed drinking,
more circling and less rearing actions were observed in SMF exposed group, while
CTA was acquired a short time later. The direction of circling was dependent on the
orientation of the SMF to the rats (Fig. 5.7). The behavioral response of magnetic
field exposure was abolished by chemical labyrinthectomy, suggesting that the ves-
tibular apparatus of the intact inner ear is the locus of magnetic field interaction
(Houpt et al. 2007; Cason et al. 2009). The generality of SMF induced behavioral
effects was further demonstrated in mice exposed to SMFs with similar magnetic
flux density (Tsuji et al. 1996; Lockwood et al. 2003). With rat model for Huntington
disease, the static magnetic field north and south promoted a distinct behavioral
profile and morphological preservation after 7 days of lesion with quinolinic acid
associated with apomorphine (APO) (Giorgetto et al. 2015).
Magnetic therapy as a non-contact, non-invasive, and cheap physiotherapeutic
method has been used for analgesic modulation. Gyires et al. (2008) reported that
acute exposure of mice to 2–754 mT SMF resulted in an opioid-mediated analgesic
action in the writhing test in the mouse. Exposure of mice to both inhomogeneous
(3–477 mT) and homogeneous (145 mT) SMF generated an analgesic effect toward
visceral pain elicited by chemically induced pain (Kiss et al. 2013). Antal and
László (2009) found that inhomogeneous subchronic SMF could prohibit the
increased sensitivity of mice to mechanical stimuli in neuralgia, which was in con-
sistent with the pain suppression by SMF of clinical magnetic resonance order.
However, Sekino et al. (2006) reported that SMF of 8 T upregulated the action
potentials of nerve C fiber, which enhanced pain perception in rats as the C fiber
functioned as a pain transmitter.
5.4.6.7 SMF on Reproduction and Development
The adverse effects of SMF on aspects of spermatogenesis, organogenesis, or even
ontogenesis in humans have cause great concern in recent years. Narra et al. (1996)
reported slight changes in spermatogenesis and embryogenesis in mice exposed to
SMF of 1.5 T. Amara et al. (2006a, b) examined the exposure of rats to SMF for 128

mT for 30 days and found that there was no influences on spermatogenesis in rat
testis, though the testosterone concentration reduced and oxidative stress increased
significantly. High et al. (2000) reported that there were no adverse biologic effects
in male and female adult rats or their progeny that could be attributed to a 10-week
exposure to a 9.4 T SMF. Hoyer et al. (2012) chose offspring as subjectsobtained
from pregnant dams exposed to 7 T SMF in utero and found that there were no any
obvious effects on diverse behaviors like locomotion, exploration, or spatial learn-
ing. However, Tablado et al. (2000) reported that maturation of sperm production
and motility, sperm morphology and mophometry, and postnatal testicular and epi-
didymus development in mice was largely unaffected by either single, short-term
exposure or continuous, long-term exposure at 500–700 mT. Ramadan et al. (2002)
found that exposure of mice to magnetic field of a 20 mT caused a decrease in sperm
count, motility and daily sperm production with marked testicular histopathological
changes.
The development of an embryo is a highly sensitive process. An early study
from Konermann and Monig (1986) showed no developmental effect from expo-
sure to SMF of 1 T. Okazaki et al. (2001) reported that 4.7 T SMF had no signifi-
cant effects on pregnant outbred mice and fetal development, which was confirmed
by the finding in pregnant CD-1 mice exposed to 6.3 T SMF (Murakami et al.
1992). Fetal development and the delivery were normal in pregnant mice that were
exposed to inhomogeneous SMF with 2.8–476.7 mT, but not treated with lipopoly-
saccharide (LPS) (László and Pórszász 2011). However, Mevissen et al. (1994)
reported a significant decrease in the number of live fetuses per litter in rats exposed
for the entire period of gestation to a 30 mT static field, indicating that such expo-
sure might be embryotoxic. Saito et al. (2006) suggested that SMF had an obvious
teratogenic influence on fetal development, according to data of various fetal mal-
formations, even under 400 mT exposure for only 60 min a day during pregnancy.
Recent evidence has shown that in utero-exposed male mice revealed no effect of
magnetic field strength on weight of testes and epididymis or on sperm count,
sperm morphology, or fertility; in pregnant mice that were daily exposed to SMF
of 1.5 T and 7 T during fetal development in utero, no adverse effect was noted on
duration of pregnancy, litter size, number of live births, or birth weight, and did not
lead to teratogenic effects. However, a reduced placental weight of offspring of
intrauterine exposed female mice was observed by a decrease in embryonic weight
and developmental retardation could be observed postnatally with regard to weight
gain and eye opening in mice exposed to static magnetic fields of up to 7 T (Zahedi
et al. 2014; Zaun et al. 2014).
5.4.7 Magnetic Sensing Protein in Animals
Many animals have evolved to sense the direction of the geomagnetic field for ori-
entation, navigation and migration over long distances. The blue light receptor cryp-
tochromes (CRYs) that could form radical pairs after exposure to blue light was

--- Page 164 ---

5.5 Conclusion and Persperctives 159
suggested to be a magnetoreceptor based on the proposition that radical pairs were
involved in the magnetoreception. CRYs are express not only in plant, but also in
newts, fruit flies, birds and the eyes of mammals (Möller et al. 2004; Nießner et al.
2013). Gegear et al. (2008) reported that cry mutants of Drosophila melanogaster
showed neither naive nor a magnetic field training response, while the wild-type
flies showed significant naive and trained responses to the magnetic field. Expression
of monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) cryptochrome gene in Drosophila cry
mutants rescued the responses to the magnetic field (Gegear et al. 2010). Marley
et al. (2014) reported that MF exposure coupled with CRY photoactivation during
embryogenesis is sufficient to produce heightened seizure susceptibility in resultant
Drosophila third instar (L3) larvae. Giachello et al. (2016) provided new evidence
that exposure to MF of 100 mT was sufficient to potentiate the ability of light-
activated CRY to increase neuronal action potential firing, indicating that the activ-
ity of CRY is sensitive to an external MF that is capable of modifying animal
behavior. CRYs also function as circadian photoreceptors in the Drosophila brain,
mediating the light resetting of the 24 h clock. In vertebrates, the CRYs act as the
main negative regulators for the circadian feedback loop, due to the difference in
light sensing (Yoshii et al. 2009; Fedele et al. 2014). Non-drosophilid insects encode
CRY1 and CRY2, but CRY1 retain their light-sensing properties, whereas the
CRY2s act as vertebrate-like negative regulators. Recently, Qin et al. (2016) identi-
fied a magnetoreceptor protein MagR, which co-localized with Cry in the pigeon
retina. MagR as a novel biocompass-like model may help to clarify the underlying
mechanism of magnetoreception in animal in response to magnetic field.
5.5 Conclusion and Persperctives
SMFs are constant fields that do not change in intensity or direction over time.
The impact of SMF on a biological system largely depend on the target tissue(s),
magnet characteristics, magnet support device, dosing regimen, and exposure
manner and time. Although the effects of SMFs on living organisms have been
investigated for decades, many inconsistencies and seemingly contradictory
observations exist in the literature, which may due to the lack of appropriate sys-
tematic approaches to isolate the bioeffects of the treatment relative to other fac-
tors including geomagnetic field, the use of different exposure systems, different
biological model systems, and the lack of uniformity in culture conditions and
examination methods. In recent years, the magnetic flux density of SMFs used for
medical and academic research purposes steadily increased; however, data on liv-
ing organisms with exposure to strong SMFs have not been sufficient to evaluate
these potential ecosystem risks and explore the function of magnetoreception.

Potential Applications of Static Magnetic
Fields (SMFs) in Cancer Treatment
Abstract This chapter lists current evidence (from molecular level, cellular level,
animal level to patient level) and some potential mechanisms for the effects of static
magnetic field (SMF) on cancer inhibition. The prospective applications of SMF
alone or in combination with chemotherapy drugs, pulsed magnetic field (PMF) as
well as radiotherapy in cancer treatment are also discussed.
Keywords Static magnetic field (SMF) • Cancer cell • Epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) • Cell division • Alternative treatment • Pulsed magnetic field
(PMF) • Combined therapy
6.1 Introduction
As briefly mentioned in Chap. 2, although magnetic therapy using SMF has been
used by some people as alternative treatment on multiple chronic diseases for years,
the scientific foundation is still lacking. As I have mentioned in Chap. 4, many stud-
ies have investigated the biological effects of magnetic fields on human cells, with
results that depended on multiple factors including magnetic field frequency, inten-
sity, exposure time and dynamics. More importantly, the difference in cell types
made a significant impact. In particular, a large number of reported studies showed
that the growth of multiple cancer cell types could be inhibited by SMFs, while
most non-cancer cells were not, except for some specific cell types, such as embry-
onic or neuronal cells (Raylman et al. 1996; Tofani et al. 2001; Aldinucci et al.
2003b; Rosen and Chastney 2009; Ahmadianpour et al. 2013). These indicate that
SMFs could differentially affect cancer vs. normal cells, which reveals their anti-
cancer potentials. It is well known that cancer cells are different from normal cells
in various aspects. For example, multiple types of cancers proliferate in response to
signalling from oncoproteins such as EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor). We
recently found that SMF can affect EGFR orientation to reduce its activity as well
as its related pathways to inhibit some cancer cell proliferation (Zhang et al. 2015;
Zhang et al. 2016). Another difference is that most cancer cells are at a more active
dividing state compared to normal cells. We recently also found that moderate and

strong SMFs can interfere with microtubules as well as cell division, which are also
the target of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved tumor treating
fields (TTF) electromagnetic therapy. All of these cancer-related SMF studies will
be discussed in this Chapter. The potential application of SMFs in other diseases
will be discussed in Chap. 7.
6.2 SMF Effects on Cancer Cells
6.2.1 SMFs Could Inhibit Some Cancer Cell Growth While
Have a Minimal Effect on Non-cancer Cells
As introduced in previous chapters, the exact cellular effects of SMFs on cells are
largely dependent on cell types and so far there is no consensus effect of SMF on
various kinds of cells. For example, Sullivan et al. examined the effect of 35–120
mT SMFs on four different types of cells and found that the effects varied greatly
between them (Sullivan et al. 2011). However, among different cell types, the cell
growth inhibition effects of SMF on cancer cells are much more consistent com-
pared to other cell types. Multiple studies have shown that SMFs could inhibit can-
cer cell growth while had a minimal effect on non-cancer cells (Table 6.1). Although
in each individual study, the cell types examined were very limited, we can see a
clear trend that SMFs tend to inhibit cancer cells but not non-cancer cells. For exam-
ple, in 1996, Rayman et al. showed that cell growth of a few cancer cell lines could
be inhibited by 7 T SMF (Raylman et al. 1996). Later, a few studies used both can-
cer and non-cancer cells and found that they respond to the SMFs differentially. For
example, in 2001, Tofani et al. found that the two cancer cell lines WiDr colon
cancer and MCF-7 breast cancer cells were inhibited by 3 mT SMF plus 50 Hz PMF
while the non-transformed cells MRC-5 was not affected (Tofani et al. 2001). In
addition, they also used nude mice bearing WiDr colon cancer cells and exposed
them to 70 min/day, 5 days a week for 4 consecutive weeks and found that the tumor
growth could be reduced to up to 50% by 3–4 mT SMFs combined with 1.0–2.5 mT
PMF (Tofani et al. 2001). In 2003, Aldinucci et al. found that 4.75 T SMF did not
affect human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) but inhibited Jurkat leu-
kemia cell proliferation (Aldinucci et al. 2003b). In 2006, Ghibelli et al. showed that
1 T SMF could increase the chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in human tumor U937
monocytes but not mononuclear white blood cells (Ghibelli et al. 2006). In 2011,
Tatarov et al. tested the effect of 100 mT SMF on mice bearing metastatic mouse
breast tumor EpH4-MEK-Bcl2 cells. They found that exposure of the mice to mag-
netic fields for 3 h or 6 h, but not 1 h, daily for as long as 4 weeks suppressed tumor
growth (Tatarov et al. 2011). Their study not only indicated that the moderate inten-
sity SMF could inhibit mouse breast cancer growth, but also showed that the inhibi-
tion was directly correlated to the SMF exposure time (Tatarov et al. 2011).
In 2015, Zafari et al. investigated the effects of SMF (5, 10, 20 and 30 mT)
for 24–96 h on the viability of the human cervical cancer HeLa cells and fibroblast

Current literature indicates that multiple cancer cells can be inhibited by SMFs while non- cancer
cells were not much affected. In each cell type category, the studies are arranged in a magnetic field
intensity ascending order. In most studies, only SMFs were studied, except for Tofani et al. (shown
in brown), in which PMF (pulsed magnetic field) was combined with SMF

cells. They found that the increase of SMF intensity and incubation time increased
cell death percent and proliferation rate in HeLa cell more obviously compare to
fibroblast cells (Zafari et al. 2015). Table 6.1 summaries some of the reported stud-
ies of SMF for the cell growth effect on cancer and non-cancer cells, which show
that SMFs seem to inhibit cancer cell growth while have a minimal effect on non-
cancer cells.
As mentioned above, most studies so far have only tested one or very few cell
types in a given study, which prevented people from getting a comprehensive view
of the cellular effects of SMF on different kinds of cells. Recently, our group did a
systematic investigation to examine 15 different cell lines side by side, including 12
human (7 cancer cell lines and 5 non-cancer cell lines) and 3 rodent cell lines. We
chose 1 T moderate intensity SMF because it was close to the magnetic exposure of
patients to MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) in many hospitals, as well as some
magnetic therapy field strength. To get unbiased and reproducible results, we tried
to minimize experimental variations by doing the same sets of experiments for at
least three times by two different researchers. They performed the experiments
independently and their results were pooled together for statistic data analysis. After
careful analysis, we found that the cell number of most solid cancer cells we tested
could be inhibited by a 1 T moderate intensity SMF when the cells were seeded at
higher cell densities (Table 6.2). In contrast, the cell numbers of the five human non-
cancer cell lines were not reduced. Therefore, it is interesting that we found SMF
not only affect cell proliferation in a cell type-dependent manner, the cell density
also played indespensible roles (Table 6.2) (Zhang et al. 2017).
6.2.2 SMFs Change EGFR Orientation and Inhibit Its Kinase
Activity to Reduce Cancer Cell Proliferation
SMFs have been shown to inhibit some cancer cell proliferation while have mini-
mum effects on non-cancer cells in multiple studies, but the mechanism was unclear.
Many types of cancer cells proliferate in response to signalling from Receptor
Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs), and the effect of magnetic fields on EGFR phosphoryla-
tion has been investigated in several studies (Jia et al. 2007; Sun et al. 2008; Sun et al.
2013). It was shown that PMFs (both 0.4 mT 50 Hz low frequency and 2 μT 1.8 GHz
radiofrequency) increased EGFR phosphorylation. However, it was very interesting
that this effect could be reversed by incoherent (“noise”) magnetic fields of the same
magnetic field intensities (Sun et al. 2008; Sun et al. 2013). These results not only
demonstrate that EGFR is a molecular target for magnetic fields, but also show that
the different types of magnetic fields have differential effects on EGFR activities.
However, whether and how EGFR could be affected by SMFs were unknown.
Recently, we tested the effect of SMFs on EGFR and found that moderate and strong
intensity SMFs could actually inhibit EGFR activity both in vitro and in cells in a
magnetic field intensity-dependent way (Zhang et al. 2016) (Fig. 6.1a). We further
explored the underlying mechanism using scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM)
(Fig. 6.1b) and molecular dynamics simulation (Fig. 6.1c). We found that SMF could

7 human solid cancer cell lines, 5 human non-cancer cell lines as well as 3 rodent cell lines were
included. Cells were plated one day ahead for attachment to the culture plate before they were
exposed to 1 T SMF for another 2 days. 4–5 × 105 cells were plated in the “high densities” group
so that the cells were confluent at the end of experiments. 0.5 × 105 cells were plated in the “low
densities” group so that the cells were around half confluent at the end of experiments. Experiments
were repeated for 3–4 times by two independent researchers (Results were from Zhang et al. 2017.

affect the orientation of EGFR kinase domain, which interfered with the normal
interaction between EGFR monomers to inhibit their activation. In addition, although
the CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cell number was not affected by 0.05 T, 1 T or 9 T
SMFs, EGFR transfected CHO cells became responsive to SMFs and were effec-
tively inhibited by 1 T and 9 T SMFs (Fig. 6.1d). Therefore, although we are aware
that EGFR is not the only target of SMFs in cells, it is at least one of the key factors
that contribute to SMF-induced cancer cell inhibition. In the meantime, the molecu-
lar mechanisms underlying these different magnetic field types-induced differential
EGFR activity changes need to be further explored.
It is promising that our results showed that the cancer vs. non-cancer cells from
the same tissue responded to the SMF totally differently. The growth of A549 lung
cancer cells was inhibited by 1 T SMF when they were seeded at high density
(Table 6.2). In contrast, the growth of normal lung cells was promoted by 1 T SMF
at high cell seeding density (Table 6.2). We analyzed their EGFR-mTOR-Akt path-
way and found that the A549 lung cancer and HSAEC2-KT non-cancer lung cells
have dramatically different EGFR-mTOR-Akt pathway expression and activation
(Fig. 6.2) (Zhang et al. 2017). The EGFR expression and phosphorylation levels are
much higher in A549 lung cancer cells than in HSAEC2-KT normal lung cells. The
mTOR and AKT expression and phosphorylation levels are also significantly higher
in A549 lung cancer cells. These results, combined with the EGFR studies men-
tioned above (Zhang et al. 2016), demonstrate that EGFR-mTOR-Akt pathway is
likely to be one of the key factors that contribute to the cell type differences in SMF-
induced cell proliferation changes. In addition, it should be mentioned that the cell
density also affected the A549 lung cancer cells and normal lung cells HSAEC2-KT
in different pattern (Fig. 6.2). For example, the EGFR and 4EBP1 expression and
phosphorylation level were increased in higher cell density compared to lower cell
density in A549 lung cancer cells but not in HSAEC2-KT normal lung cells. These
results indicate that EGFR-mTOR-Akt pathway may be a key factor that contributes
to both cell type- and cell density-dependent SMF effects.

182 6 Potential Applications of Static Magnetic Fields (SMFs) in Cancer Treatment
6.2.3 SMFs and Cell Division
Besides EGFR, there are other cellular components that play indespensible roles in
SMF-induced cancer inhibition, such as cell division. Since cell division is a key
step that leads to tumor growth, perturbations that disrupt or interfere with cell divi-
sion could inhibit tumor growth. In fact, there are multiple chemodrugs that target
cell division, such as Taxol. Moreover, cancer and non-cancer cells have been shown
to respond differentially to cell cycle perturbations. For example, it has been
reported that the human non-transformed cells and cancer cells have significant
survival difference in response to the microtubule drugs treatment (Brito and Rieder
2009). Brito and Rieder found that both nocodazole and Taxol, two microtubule
poisons, could kill much more HeLa and U2OS cancer cells than the non-cancer
RPE1 cells. Specifically, 5 nM of Taxol, which is approximately the clinical concen-
tration for chemotherapy, could kill 93% of HeLa cells and 46% of U2OS cells but
only killed 1% of RPE1 cells (Brito and Rieder 2009). In addition, different types of
cancer cells also have differential responses to microtubule drugs (Tang et al. 2013).
Moreover, the depletion of plk1 (polo-like kinase), which is a vital regulator in mul-
tiple cellular processes, especially in cell cycle progression, caused significant cell
proliferation and cell cycle abnormalities in human cervical cancer HeLa cells, but
not the non-cancer RPE1 or MCF10A breast cells (Liu et al. 2006). Therefore, tar-
geting microtubules or cell cycle could generate different effects on cancer vs. non-
cancer cells or in different types of cancer cells.
The key structure that controls the whole cell division process is the mitotic spin-
dle, which is mainly composed of microtubules. It is well known that microtubules
can be affected by SMFs and recent evidences showed that cell division could also
be affected by SMFs, which was discussed in Chap. 4. Although most results so far
showed that SMFs did not change the overall cell cycle distribution of a given cell
population, we found that prolonged exposure (7 days) to 1 T SMF could increase the
abnormal spindle percentage and the mitotic index in HeLa cells, which was also
discussed in Chap. 4. Moreover, we found that the duration of mitosis was increased
by 1 T SMF (Fig. 6.3). Using cell synchronization experiment (Fig. 6.3a), we found
that 1 T SMF could delay cells exiting from mitosis (Fig. 6.3). In the absence of 1 T
SMF, most of the double thymidine synchronized cells exit from mitosis 12 h after
thymidine release. However, there were a significantly increased number of HeLa
cells staying in mitosis in the presence of 1 T SMF (Fig. 6.3c, d, e).
The mechanisms of the differential responses of cancer vs. non-cancer cells to
SMFs still remain partially understood. However, SMF-induced microtubule inter-
ference is a broad impact on most dividing cells. Meanwhile, we should keep in
mind that although EGFR and cell division are important, they are definitely not the
only reasons that can explain the differences between SMF-induced differential
effects among various cell types. Other factors are also likely involved. For exam-
ple, Short et al. showed that 4.7 T SMF could alter the ability of human malignant
melanoma cells attachment onto the tissue culture plate, but had no effect on normal
human fibroblasts (Short et al. 1992), which indicated that the cell attachment was

differentially affected by SMF in cancer vs. non-cancer cells. Moreover, other
aspects should also be carefully investigated, such as cell metabolism, mitochondria
functions, ROS (reactive oxygen species) responses and ATP level, which could all
be affected differentially in cancer vs. normal cells. Our group is currently working
on these topics and we expect to have a much better understanding on this issue in
the near future.

6.2.4 SMFs and Tumor Microcirculation
There are a few studies indicating that moderate intensity SMFs could inhibit angio-
genesis and tumor microcirculation, which could inhibit cancer growth in vivo. For
example, in 2008, Strieth et al. examined the effects of SMF (< 600 mT) on A-Mel-3
tumors growing in dorsal skinfold chamber preparations of Syrian Golden hamsters.
They found that short-time exposure to SMF (about 150 mT) resulted in a signifi-
cant reduction of red blood cell velocity (vRBC) and segmental blood flow in tumor
microvessels (Strieth et al. 2008). At 587 mT, a reversible reduction of vRBC and a
reduction of functional vessel density were observed. In addition, they found that
prolongation of the exposure time from 1 min to up to 3 h had a more significant
result. Moreover, SMFs not only reduced blood flow in tumor vessels but also acti-
vate and increase the adherence of platelets (Strieth et al. 2008). In 2009, Strelczyk
et al. further evaluated the effects of prolonged exposure to SMFs on tumor angio-
genesis and growth. They found that 586 mT SMF exposure for 3 h could inhibit
both tumor angiogenesis and growth (Strelczyk et al. 2009). Detailed analysis
revealed that the functional vessel density, vessel diameters and vRBC in tumors
were all reduced by SMFs. In addition, they also observed increased edema after
SMF exposure, which indicated that SMFs might increase tumor microvessel leaki-
ness. In 2014, their group did some further analysis and found that the 587 mT SMF
did increase the tumor microvessel permeability significantly in A-Mel-3-tumor-
bearing hamsters (Gellrich et al. 2014) (Fig. 6.4). It was interesting but not surpris-
ing that the functional tumor microvessels, labeled by FITC-dextran, were much
decreased after SMF exposure, especially after the repeated SMF exposure, which
was likely due to the inhibited tumor angiogenesis. Nevertheless, it was obvious that
both SMF single exposure and repeated exposure increased the blood vessel leaki-
ness and the repeated SMF exposure had stronger effects. In addition, the increased
microvessel permeability was likely the reason for the improved anti-tumor efficacy
of SMFs in combination with paclitaxel (Fig. 6.5) (Gellrich et al. 2014).
An independent group also reported the effects of SMF on angiogenesis. In 2009,
Wang et al. investigated the effects of the gradient SMF (0.2–0.4 T, 2.09 T/m, expo-
sure time 1–11 days) on angiogenesis in the human umbilical veins endothelial cells
(HUVECs) as well as two in vivo models, a chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM)
and a matrigel plug (Wang et al. 2009). Their results showed that the
HUVECs proliferation was significantly inhibited 24 h after exposure. In addi-
tion, the two in vivo models both showed decreased angiogenesis after 7 or 11 days
of exposure (Wang et al. 2009). Although this study was not carried out in a tumor-
related model, it showed the inhibition effect of moderate intensity SMFs on angio-
genesis, which was consistent with the results reported by Strieth and co-workers
(Strieth et al. 2008; Strelczyk et al. 2009). Taken together, these studies showed that
moderate intensity SMFs of 0.1–0.6 T could reduce angiogenesis in some animal
models, which implied their potential for tumor growth inhibition in vivo. Additional
research is needed to ascertain this effect, such as the effects of other magnetic field
intensities as well as more types of tumor models.

There are some researches implicated that moderate intensity SMFs could poten-
tially work as an adjunctive treatment method for chemotherapy (Gray et al. 2000;

Fig. 6.5 Tumor growth inhibition by SMF in combination with chemodrug paclitaxel. In
2014, Gellrich et al. tested the effect of 587 mT SMF in the presence of absence of the chemodrug
paclitaxel for their inhibition effects on A-Mel-3-tumor-bearing hamsters. After the third treat-
ment, SMF alone could inhibit tumor growth. However, the combination therapy yielded a more
pronounced tumor growth delay than any other group. *p < 0.05. The animals were randomly
assigned to four groups (n = 6, each) 5 days after tumor inoculation. On day 5, 7 and 9 after tumor
cell implantation, the “paclitaxel + SMF” group was treated by continuous intravenous infusion of
paclitaxel over 90 min during exposure to 587 mT for 120 min. The “paclitaxel” group was treated
with paclitaxel alone intravenously over 90 min without SMF-exposure. The “SMF” group was
exposed to SMF of 587 mT over a period of 120 min without receiving paclitaxel. The “NaCl”
group was injected with 0.9% NaCl intravenously over 90 min applying identical volumes as in the
other experimental groups (Reprinted with permission from Gellrich et al. 2014. Copyright © 2013

studies have investigated the combination effects of SMFs with chemodrugs and
most of them achieved enhanced anti-tumor efficacy compared to SMF or chemo-
drugs alone. For example, in 2014, Gellrich et al. found that a 587 mT SMF could
significantly increase the anti-tumor efficiency of paclitaxel chemotherapy in
A-Mel-3-tumor-bearing hamsters (Fig. 6.5) because the 587 mT SMF inhibited
tumor angiogenesis and increased tumor microvessel permeability significantly
(Gellrich et al. 2014). Our group also found that 1 T moderate intensity SMF could
increase the antitumor efficacy of mTOR inhibitors, EGFR inhibitors, Akt inhibi-
tors, as well as Taxol and 5-Fu (Zhang et al. 2015, 2016, 2017; Luo et al. 2016). In
addition, chemotherapy drug adriamycin had enhanced inhibition effect on the
growth of leukemic cells K562 and transplanted mammary tumors in mice when it
was combined with moderate intensity SMFs of 110 mT or 8.8 mT, respectively
(Gray et al. 2000; Hao et al. 2011). For the leukemic cells K562, the combination of
8.8 mT SMF can also increase the working efficiency of the chemodrug paclitaxel
(Sun et al. 2012b). For leukemic cell line HL-60, 1 T SMF also had combinational
effects with a mixture of four chemodrugs (5-Fu, Cisplatin, doxorubicin and vin-
cristine) (Sabo et al. 2002). In 2006, Ghibelli et al. showed that 1 T SMF increased
apoptosis induced by anti-tumor drugs in human tumor U937 monocytes but not
mononuclear white blood cells (Ghibelli et al. 2006). This indicated that the

--- Page 191 ---

6.3 SMFs in Combination with Other Treatments 187
combination of SMFs with chemodrugs might preferentially work on tumor cells
but not normal cells although more studies are needed to confirm this point. It was
proposed that the cell membrane permeability can be increased by SMFs to allow
more drugs entering cells (Tofani et al. 2003; Liu et al. 2011; Gellrich et al. 2014).
This is an appealing explanation because it can explain the combined effects of
SMFs and chemodrugs. It is also explainable because SMFs were shown to have
alignment effects on lipids (discussed in Chap. 3). However, it is puzzling that
SMFs do not simply promote effects of all chemotherapy drugs. For example,
Vergallo et al. showed that 31.7–232 mT SMFs did not promote the anticancer
effect of Cisplatin in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (Vergallo et al. 2014).
In fact, our lab used four different human cancer cell lines, including cervical cancer
HeLa, colon cancer HCT116, nasopharyngeal cancer CNE-2Z and breast cancer
MCF7 cell lines and found that 1 T SMF can increase efficacy of 5-Fu and 5-Fu +
Taxol but not Cisplatin in all four cell lines that we tested (Luo et al. 2016). This
demonstrates that the combinational effects of SMFs with chemodrugs may be
drug-specific and/or cell type-specific.
However, it should be mentioned that the current experimental results about
combination of SMFs with Cisplatin are not completely consistent. Although we
and Vergallo et al. found that SMFs did not increase the efficacy of Cisplatin and
even had a tendency to antagonize the effects of Cisplatin, there are also some other
evidence showing opposite results. For example, it was shown that SMFs could
increase the antitumor effects of Cisplatin in mice bearing lewis lung carcinoma
(Tofani et al. 2003) and leukemic cells K562 (Chen et al. 2010). We think this is
probably due to the different magnetic intensities in independent studies (ranging
from a few millitesla to a few hundred milliteslas) or cell type difference. Both of
these factors could directly influence the magnetic effects as we have discussed
earlier. More specifically, studies reported that SMFs of 1–10 mT could increase the
antitumor efficacy of Cisplatin (Tofani et al. 2003; Chen et al. 2010) but in ours
(Luo et al. 2016) and Vergallo et al.’s studies (Vergallo et al. 2014), we both used
stronger magnetic fields (31.7–232 mT in Vergallo et al.’s study and 1 T in our
study). Maybe lower magnetic field intensity could increase the Cisplatin efficacy
while higher magnetic field intensity has the opposite functions. The exact effects
and mechanisms of combining SMFs with Cisplatin in different cells need to be
further investigated.
In fact, there are some studies indicated that both magnetic field intensity and
cell type could influence the effect of SMF in combination with drugs. In 1999,
Fanelli et al. found that SMFs with different intensities starting from 6 gauss could
decrease the extent of cell death by apoptosis induced by several agents in different
human cell systems via modulation of Ca2+ influx, and this effect was magnetic field
intensity-dependent (Fanelli et al. 1999). This directly showed that the magnetic
field intensity could influence the effect of SMFs with drugs. For cell type induced
difference, in 2003, Aldinucci et al. tested a few different cell types for the effects
of combining a 4.75 T SMF and a pulsed EMF of 0.7 mT generated by an NMR
apparatus (NMRF) for 1 h. They found that in T cell leukemia Jurkat cells the cal-
cium level was reduced significantly after exposure (Aldinucci et al. 2003b) but in
normal or in PHA challenged lymphocytes the calcium level was increased

188
(Aldinucci et al. 2003a). Moreover, in 2006, Ghibelli et al. compared two different
magnetic field intensities (1 T vs. 6 mT), four different cell lines (two cancer cell
lines, human leukemic monocyte lymphoma U937 cells and T cell leukemia Jurkat
cells as well as two types of normal cells, human monocytes and lymphocytes)
(Ghibelli et al. 2006). It was not surprising that neither the 1 T nor the 6 mT SMF
induced apoptosis in all four types of cells, which is consistent with what have dis-
cussed in Chap. 4. However, it is interesting that 1 T SMF increased puromycin
(PMC)-induced apoptosis in U937 cells (Fig. 6.6), but not in other three cell types
(Ghibelli et al. 2006). In addition, unlike 1 T SMF, the 6 mT SMF did not increase
the PMC-induced apoptosis in any of the cells. In contrast, it reduced the PMC-
induced apoptosis in U937 cells (Fig. 6.6) (Ghibelli et al. 2006). Moreover, Tenuzzo
et al. used 6 mT SMF and apoptosis-inducing agents (cycloheximide, H2O2, puro-
mycin, heat shock, etoposide) to compare their effects on human lymphocytes, mice
thymocytes and cultures of 3DO, U937, HeLa, HepG2 and FRTL-5 cells. Their
results showed that 6 mT SMF exposure interfered with apoptosis in a cell type- and
exposure time-dependent manner (Tenuzzo et al. 2006). All above mentioned stud-
ies showed that both magnetic field intensity and cell type, and even exposure time,
could influence the effect of SMF in combination with drugs.

6.3 SMFs in Combination with Other Treatments 189
In addition to the magnetic field intensity and cell type, the cell density and chemo-
drug concentration also affect the combinational effects of chemodrugs and SMFs.
For example, we have reported that 1 T SMF could increase the efficacy of some
chemodrugs (5-Fu, Taxol) in multiple human solid cancer cell lines, such as breast
cancer MCF-7, colon cancer HCT116, nasophageal cancer CNE-2Z cells but only at
some drug concentrations (Luo et al. 2016). In addition, we recently expanded our
studies from solid tumor to leukemia cells. First of all, it was interesting that we found
the cell growth of human leukemia K562 cells can be inhibited by a 0.5 T SMF at
lower cell concentration but not at higher cell concentration (Fig. 6.7a), which was
different from most of the solid cancer cell lines we tested (Table 6.2). Then we used
the low cell concentration to test the combination effects of the 0.5 T SMF with
Vincristine in K562 cells and found that SMF did increase the drug efficacy of
Vincristine at 0.5, 1 as well as 2 nM but with slightly different effectiveness (Fig. 6.7b).
In conclusion, it is clear that although in most cases, SMFs could increase the
efficacy of chemodrugs, there are also some studies showed that there were no syn-
ergetic or additive effects between SMFs and some chemodrugs (Table 6.3). These
differential effects could be caused by cell type, field intensity as well as drug dif-
ferences. Therefore the strategy of combining SMFs of different intensities with
various chemodrugs in different cancer cells also needs to be further investigated.
This is not only helpful to explore the potential application of combinational ther-
apy of SMFs with chemodrugs, but also to alert people with specific chemotherapy,
such as Cisplatin, for limited MRI or other types of SMF exposure in hospitals.
6.3.2 SMFs in Combination with Pulsed Magnetic Field
(PMF)
There are multiple studies showing that SMFs combined with PMF could inhibit
cancer cell growth (Tofani 2015) (Table 6.4). For example, Tofani et al. have made
series progresses on the combination of SMF and 50 Hz PMF. In 2001, Tofani et al.
showed that 3 mT SMF combined with 50 Hz PMF could induce more apoptosis in
cells compared to SMF or the 50 Hz PMF alone (Tofani et al. 2001). In addition, it
was interesting that apoptosis only occurred in the two transformed cell lines (WiDr
human colon adenocarcinoma and MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma) but not
the nontransformed cell line (MRC-5 embryonal lung fibroblast). They also tested
them in nude mice xenografted with WiDr cells and exposed them for 70 min/day,
5 days/week, to ≤5 mT SMF in combination with PMF for 4 weeks and found that
the tumor was significantly inhibited (up to 50%) (Tofani et al. 2001). In 2002, they
further tested the effects of 5.5 mT SMF in combination with 50 Hz PMF and found
that the survival time of nude mice with WiDr cells was increased by 31% when the
mice were exposed to magnetic fields for 70 min/day for 4 weeks (Tofani et al.
2002). When the mice were exposed to the magnetic fields for 4 consecutive weeks,
significant inhibition of tumor growth (40%) together with a decrement in tumor
cell mitotic index and proliferative activity were observed. In addition, they also

Fig. 6.7 0.5 T SMF increases the efficacy of Vincristine in K562 leukemia cells. (a) Two dif-
ferent cell concentrations of K562 cells respond to 0.5 T SMF differently. The cells were seeded at
25,000 or 200,000 cells/ml one day ahead, incubated in the absence or presence of a 0.5 T SMF for
another 2 days before their cell numbers were quantified. (b) 0.5 T SMF increases the efficacy of
Vincristine in K562 cells. 25,000 cells/ml of K562 cells were plated one night ahead and exposed
to a 0.5 T SMF with different concentrations of Vincristine for 2 days before the cell numbers were
measured. The 0.5 T SMF was provided by placing the cell plate on the top center of a 5 × 5 × 5 cm
neodymium permanent magnet, with the North pole facing up. The control group was placed at at
least 30–40 cm away from the magnet with a measured magnetic field intensity background of 0.9
Gs, which was around 5000 fold lower than the 0.5 T experimental group. Experiments were
repeated for 3 times by two independent researchers. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.005 (Our lab
unpublished data) (Figure was provided by Xinmiao Ji and Meng Zha)
found a significant increase in apoptosis together with a reduction in immunoreac-
tive p53 expression (Tofani et al. 2002). These works indicate that SMF + 50 Hz
PMF of above 3 mT may have anti-cancer potentials. In contrast, lower magnetic
field intensity, such as 1 mT SMF did not induce cell apoptosis as 3, 10 or 30 mT
SMFs did (Tofani et al. 2001). Actually, their results could potentially explain why
Bodega et al. did not observe any changes when they exposed cultured astroglial
cells to a combined 1 mT SMF with sinusoidal 50 Hz PMF for 11 days (Bodega
et al. 2005), which might due to the low magnetic field strength.

To our knowledge, all reported studies used the combination of mili-Tesla SMFs
(1–10 mT) with 50 Hz PMF of similar magnetic field intensity (Table 6.4). The
combination effects of SMFs with higher magnetic field intensity and/or in combi-
nation with PMFs of other frequencies besides 50 Hz have not been reported.
Whether the currently reported cancer inhibition effects of mili-Tesla SMFs with
50 Hz PMF can also be applied to other magnetic field parameters, such as different
magnetic field intensity or frequency, is still unknown. In addition, since the three
cell lines Tofani et al. tested showed different responses to the combinational treat-
ment of SMF + PMF (increased apoptosis in two cancer cells lines WiDr and MCF-7
but not non-cancer cell line MRC-5), it is likely that the effects are also cell type-
dependent. Whether other cancer cell types can also be inhibited by SMF + PMF
still need more investigations.
6.3.3 SMFs in Combination with Radiotherapy
Radiation therapy (radiotherapy) is commonly used in cancer treatment. It uses
high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells and reduce tumor size. Currently the most
commonly used types of radiation are X-rays. In some cases, gamma rays and
charged particles are also used for cancer treatment. In recent years, image-guided
radiotherapy (IGRT) has greatly improved the precision and accuracy of radiother-
apy, which takes advantage of modern imaging techniques such as ultrasound,
X-ray and CT (computed tomography) scan. The information provided by these
imaging techniques before and during radiotherapy treatment not only shows the
size, shape and position of the tumor itself, the surrounding tissues and bones, but

precision of daily radiotherapy fractions. Although CT scan is mostly used in cur-
rent IGRT, MRI-guided radiotherapy is attracting increasing attention. It is well
known that MRI gives superior soft tissue contrast and more importantly, MRI
could offer the advantage of providing IGRT without delivering an additional radia-
tion dose to the patients compared to CT or X ray imaging. Currently there are
multiple groups are building or starting to test MRI (0.3–0.5 T)-guided radiother-
apy. Moreover, Elekta has announced its plans for the commercial release of
Atlantic, a high-field MRI (1.5 T)-guided radiotherapy system, which may be
launched in 2017–2018.
Along with the introduction of MRI-guided radiotherapy, the potential effects of
SMFs on ionizing radiation have become increasingly important. However, the
accompanied lab studies about the combinational effects of SMF and radiation is
lacking. Although there are some evidences showing that the effects of ionizing
radiation on cells could be strengthened by PMFs, such as 50 Hz magnetic fields
(Francisco et al. 2013), the studies about SMFs in combination with radiotherapy
are much less. So far there are only a few studies that have investigated the combi-
national effects of SMFs with ionizing radiation and most of these studies indicated
that SMFs might be able to increase the effectiveness of radiotherapy (Table 6.5).
For example, in 2002, Nakahara found that although 10 T SMF itself had no effect
on CHO-K1 cell growth, cell cycle distribution, or micronucleus frequency, they
could cause an increase in the micronucleus formation induced by 4 Gy X-rays
(Nakahara et al. 2002). In 2010, Sarvestani et al. investigated the effects of a 15 mT
SMF alone for 5 h or 0.5 Gy X-ray +15 mT SMF sequential exposures (first X ray
and then SMF for 5 h) on cell cycle progression in rat bone marrow stem cells
(BMSC). They did not find any cell cycle changes in SMF alone treated cells but

--- Page 198 ---

194 6 Potential Applications of Static Magnetic Fields (SMFs) in Cancer Treatment
found that 15 mT SMF exposure could further increase the G2/M cell percentage
induced by 0.5 Gy X-ray (Sarvestani et al. 2010). In 2014, Teodori et al. investigated
the genotoxic effect of 80 mT SMF, both alone and in combination with X-ray irra-
diation, on primary glioblastoma cells. Their results showed that exposure of cells
to 5 Gy of X-ray irradiation alone led to extensive DNA damage,which was signifi-
cantly reduced by 80 mT SMF (Teodori et al. 2014). The DNA damage promotion
effect of 10 T SMF in CHO-K1 cells (Nakahara et al. 2002) and the DNA damage
reduction effect of 80 mT SMF in primary glioblastoma cells (Teodori et al. 2014)
seem to be controversial. However, this difference could be due to the cell type or
magnetic field intensity difference. In 2013, Politanski et al. investigated the com-
bined effect of X-ray radiation and SMFs on reactive oxygen species (ROS) in lym-
phocytes from male albino Wistar rats. Their results indicated that 5 mT SMF
increased the ROS increase changes induced by 3 Gy X-ray radiation while “0 mT”
(50 μT magnetic field induction opposite to the geomagnetic field) always showed
opposite effects compared to 5 mT SMF (Politanski et al. 2013). This indicated that
different magnetic field intensity could directly influence its effect on radiation-
induced effects. More researches are needed to get a complete understanding about
different magnetic field intensities, especially around the range of MRI scanners,
and their effects on radiation-induced effects on different cell types. Other types of
radiation, such as gamma radiation, should also be investigated.
6.4 Patient Studies
It is interesting and promising that time-varying electromagnetic fields have been
shown to be effective in multiple studies at patient level and was introduced as a
novel cancer treatment modality. The most famous example was the tumor treating
fields (TTF, or TTFields) therapy, which delivers low-intensity, intermediate-
frequency (100–300 kHz), alternating electric fields that cause apoptosis or cell
death by inducing mitotic catastrophe and can effectively inhibit the growth of a
variety of human and rodent tumor cell lines, with no significant damage to normal
non-dividing cells (Kirson et al. 2004; Pless and Weinberg 2011; Davies et al. 2013).
In addition, Barbault et al. examined patients with various types of cancer using a
noninvasive biofeedback method to identify “tumor-specific frequencies” (Barbault
et al. 2009). They implied that cancer-related frequencies appeared to be tumor-
specific and treatment with tumor-specific frequencies was feasible, well tolerated
and may have biological efficacy in patients with advanced cancer (Barbault et al.
2009). Recently, Kim et al. used TTF to study the metastatic potential of U87 and
U373 glioblastoma cell lines and found that TTF affected NF-κB, MAPK and PI3K/
AKT signalling pathways as well as downregulated VEGF, HIF1α and matrix
metalloproteinases 2 and 9, which indicated that TTF could be a promising novel
anti-invasion and anti-angiogenesis therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma patients
(Kim et al. 2016). More importantly, studies reported that treating recurrent glio-
blastoma patients with TTF improved overall survival (OS) and there was no

--- Page 199 ---

6.4 Patient Studies 195
unexpected adverse effects (De Bonis et al. 2012; Rulseh et al. 2012). Due to these
clinical outcomes, TTF was approved by the FDA as an alternative to the standard
treatment for patients with recurrent and newly diagnosed glioblastoma.
In contrast, although a large number of in vitro and in vivo studies indicating the
anticancer potentials of SMFs, there is only a very small amount of data concerning
their application in clinical cancer treatment so far. In 2003, Salvatore et al. found
that there was no increase in the severity of chemotherapy toxicity as measured by
white blood cell count and platelet count in the participants exposed to SMF
(Salvatore et al. 2003). In 2004, Ronchetto et al. examined eleven patients with
“heavily pretreated” advanced cancer in a pilot study with different SMF exposure
and found that the magnetic fields can be safely administrated according to their
exposure schedules (Ronchetto et al. 2004). Although these studies indicated the
safety of SMFs at patient level, the effectiveness of these SMFs on cancer inhibition
is still lacking, which still needs to be proved. In fact, there are some clinical studies
reported in some Chinese journals about the successful application of SMFs on
some cancer treatment, which have been reviewed by Dr. Zhou, although also writ-
ten in Chinese (Zhou 2000). In these studies, it seems that applying permanent
magnets either alone or in combination with PMF or radiotherapy could have posi-
tive effects in cancer inhibition, and the effects are correlated with the magnetic
field intensities. More specifically, it was shown that the SMF of 0.2 T and above
had anti-cancer effects but SMFs blow 0.1 T did not. To my point of view, although
these studies do not really meet the criteria of scientific investigations, they appear
promising. However, more double blinded, well controlled clinical investigations
are needed to confirm their claims.
In the meantime, it is interesting and promising that there are also some positive
findings for magnetic devices that use permanent magnets, but spin them at low
speed. They call them “extremely low-frequency magnetic fields” (Wang et al.
2011; Sun et al. 2012a; Nie et al. 2013a; Nie et al. 2013b). For example, in 2012,
Sun et al. investigated the effects of 420 r/min, 0.4 T magnetic fields on the survival
and palliation of general symptoms in 13 advanced non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) patients (Sun et al. 2012a). The patients were treated for 2 h/day, 5 days/
week for 6–10 weeks. While the median survival of the advanced NSCLC patients
receiving supportive care was 4 months, their “spinning magnetic device” could
prolong the median survival to 6 months, which was 50% increase. Although 6
months median survival was still shorter than that of patients receiving chemo-
therapy (Cisplatin, 9.1 months; Carboplatin, 8.4 months), the magnetic field-
treated patients had no severe toxicity or side-effects. More importantly, the 1-year
survival rate was 31.7%, which was much higher than patients only receiving sup-
portive care (15%), and comparable to patients receiving chemotherapy (Cisplatin,
37%; Carboplatin, 34%). In the meantime, the magnetic fields treated patients had
improved physical conditions and alleviated symptoms in general (Sun et al.
2012a). In fact, the effect of this type of machine has also been proved to be effec-
tive on advanced cancer patients by another independent group in China (personal
communications, unpublished work) as well as in cancer cell and mice
models (Wang et al. 2011; Nie et al. 2013a; Nie et al. 2013b). Meanwhile,
there are also other unofficial reports claiming that spinning magnets could be used

--- Page 200 ---

196 6 Potential Applications of Static Magnetic Fields (SMFs) in Cancer Treatment
as alternative treatment for patients. Therefore, it is a promising field to explore but
apparently these reported studies are still at very preliminary stage. In fact, an
important criticism of these human case reports is the lack of control subjects.
Therefore, more rigorous, well controlled and double-blinded clinical trials are
strongly needed to prove the effectiveness of SMFs in cancer treatment. The mag-
netic field parameters, such as the field strength, fixed or spinning, exposure sched-
ule and cancer types should all be tested.
6.5 Conclusion
Cancer is a heterogeneous disease and its complexity has hindered the development
of effective and safe treatments. The studies listed in this chapter greatly helped us
to understand some of the mechanisms that SMFs affect cancer cells and their
potential applications in cancer treatment in the future. We only discussed about
membrane receptor EGFR, cell division and microcirculation here, but it is likely
that other aspects are also involved in SMF-induced cancer inhibition, such as ion
channels, ROS, the immune system as well as metabolism. Moreover, current cel-
lular studies and animal models of SMF effects on cancers are variable in reproduc-
ibility, and further systematic studies of different treatment parameters would be
definitely beneficial. In the meantime, while some mechanisms of action have been
proposed, their substantiation is needed. Although more research should be con-
ducted to demonstrate its safety and efficacy, current experimental results indicate
that SMF is relatively safe. Understanding and exploiting the potential application
of SMFs would be an essential aspect of adjuvant therapies targeting conventional
treatment-resistant tumors in the future.

Chapter 7
Prospects, Pitfalls, and Opportunities
for Human Static Magnetic Field (SMF)
Therapy
Abstract This chapter provides an overview of the prospects of using electromag-
netic fields (EMFs), with a specific focus on static magnetic fields (SMFs), for treat-
ment of human disease. The information provided covers the underlying basis for
widespread skepticism surrounding “magnetotherapy” – which in part is deserved
based on overinflated claims by its practitioners over the past two centuries (or even
longer). On the other hand, a compelling scientific foundation is in place to propel
nascent efforts to use magnetotherapy from a questionable niche medical practice
into the mainstream; a goal of this chapter is to provide a summary of this informa-
tion using specific (but non-comprehensive) examples of human ailments that are
expected (based on current information) to benefit from magnetic field treatment.
Keywords Magnetic field therapy • Magnetotherapy • Static magnetic fields
(SMFs)
7.1 Introduction
Therapies that involve exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs) date back to the
inception of practical methods to harness and exploit magnetism and electricity.
Anecdotal folklore suggests that the subset of these therapies using time invariant
(i.e., static) magnetic fields (SMFs) extend back two or even three thousand years
(perhaps to 1000 BC (Mourino 1991)), when “lodestones” were thought to have the
ability to draw disease out of a person’s body (Palermo 2015; Zyss 2008). Jumping
forward, by the early sixteenth century (AD) the Swiss physician Paracelsus was
using magnets to treat epilepsy, diarrhea, and hemorrhage and in the mid eighteenth
century Franz Mesmer, an Austrian doctor, had opened a healing salon in Paris to
treat the untoward effects of the body’s innate “animal magnetism” (Mourino 1991).
With the advent of electricity as a power source, EMFs were added to the healing
repertoire and were being used to assist bone healing as early as the mid nineteenth
century with definitive literature reports verifying efficacy appearing in the 1970s
(Bassett et al. 1974a, b).
Since World War II, magnetic field therapy (usually referred to as “magneto-
therapy” in this chapter) has flourished across the globe – albeit unevenly with

various levels of acceptance in different countries – with an estimated two million
recipients each year (Markov 2009). Magnetotherapy has many attractive features
including its relative low cost compared to many current treatment modalities, its
(generally) non-invasive nature, and its established safety record (with obvious
exceptions, such as individuals with medical device implants such as pacemakers or
insulin pumps). On the other hand, magnetotherapy has a longstanding reputation
for quackery. To give one example of the origins of this reputation, by the late nine-
teenth century, Thatcher’s Chicago Magnetic Company (a mail order outfit) claimed
that “magnetism properly applied will cure every curable disease no matter what the
cause” (Macklis 1993).
Today, similar overblown rhetoric from some quarters continues to obscure valid
scientific underpinnings of magnetotherapy. In part, magnetotherapy remains con-
troversial because its opponents and proponents persist in making polarized blanket
statements that either categorically rejects the possibility of beneficial health effects
while other practitioners promise miracle cures for long lists of disparate ailment.
The reality almost certainly lies between these extremes and the purpose of this
chapter is to provide an overview of what is currently known about human magnetic
field therapy, what is not known, and what needs to be known (and done) to move
this field forward.
7.2 Overview of Electromagnetic Field (EMF) Treatment
Modalities
Although rather arbitrary, EMF therapeutic modalities are generally categorized in
five categories as outlined by Markov (some classification schemes give six catego-
ries) in an excellent synopsis of the influence of magnetic fields on human health
(Markov 2014). These categories are briefly discussed below.
7.2.1 Low-Frequency Sine Waves
Low-frequency sine wave (LFS) electromagnetic fields are based on the predomi-
nant commercially-supplied electricity sources, which are 60 Hz in North American
and generally 50 Hz in Europe and Asia (Markov 2014). One use of LFS is as an
alternative to high frequency fields in deep brain stimulation for the treatment of
epilepsy (Goodman 2005; Goodman et al. 2005). Another potential application is
for the treatment of cancer (Blackman 2012); more broadly, efforts are underway to
use diverse frequencies of EMFs to treat cancer (Zimmerman et al. 2012) including
SMFs as covered in Chap. 6 of this book.

7.2 Overview of Electromagnetic Field (EMF) Treatment Modalities 203
7.2.2 Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields (PEMF)
Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) are low frequency fields with specific wave
shapes and amplitude (Markov 2014). PEMF treatment was introduced clinically in
the 1970s by Bassett and colleagues, who used a specific biphasic low frequency
signal for bone healing, in particular for the treatment of delayed fractures (Bassett
et al. 1974a, b). Although reports continue to appear questioning the efficacy of
PEMF therapy (Rose and Bryan-Frankson 2008), transcranial magnetic stimulation
devices have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for patients not responsive to chemical anti-depressants (Anonymous 2011;
Martiny et al. 2010). In addition, there are a profusion of PEMF devices that are sold
and marketed as FDA-registered “wellness devices;” these products, however, are
not permitted to claim efficacy for treating disease (Anonymous 2015).
7.2.3 Pulsed Radiofrequency Fields (PRF)
Pulsed radiofrequency field (PRF) therapy refers to the technique where radio fre-
quency oscillations are generated at a defined rate of pulses per second with ener-
gies range from 1.0 × 104 Hz to 3.0 × 1011 Hz. Therapeutically, PRFs offer an
alternative to continuous radiofrequency (CRF) therapy, which has been used since
the 1970s, and offers the advantage of pain control without tissue destruction (Byrd
and Mackey 2008). These therapies typically utilize frequencies between 300 and
750 kHz, are now delivered to precise locations in the body by catheter, and as men-
tioned are used in two primary modalities: in continuous mode these devices are
designed to produce deep heat, while in pulsed (non thermal) mode, which uses
short (e.g., 20 ms) high voltage bursts followed by a longer (e.g., 480 ms) silent
phase to allow for heat dissipation, they are used for soft tissue stimulation (Markov
2014). Thermal PRF (i.e., CFR) therapy delivers high current focally to ablate the
tissue of interest (e.g., a tumor or cardiac tissues that trigger arrhythmias) by heating
to temperatures of 60–80 °C, resulting in focal tissue destruction (Byrd and Mackey
2008).
It remains controversial whether non-thermal PRF truly avoids biological effects
due to heating; for example, although temperatures stay at or below 42 °C minimiz-
ing cell death or tissue destruction, heat shock response nonetheless could be trig-
gered. Resolving this ambiguity will ultimately be necessary to fully define the
biochemical mechanism of therapeutic responses associated with PRF therapy.
Despite uncertainty over mechanism (and even efficacy), PRF is being used to treat
a growing list of indications which are typically oriented towards amelioration of
pain including axial pain, radicular pain, facial pain, inguinal pain and orchialgia,
and miscellaneous pain syndromes (Byrd and Mackey 2008).

7.2.4 Transcranial Magnetic/Electric Stimulation (TMS)
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) involves applying very short magnetic
pulses of up to 8 Tesla to selected portions of the brain (Markov 2014). During
TMS, a magnetic field generator is placed in proximity to the head of the person
receiving the treatment (Groppa et al. 2012). The coil produces electric currents in
the region of the brain just under the coil through electromagnetic induction. TMS
can be used to diagnose connections between the brain and a muscle to evaluate
damage from several indications, including stroke, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, movement disorders, motor neuron disease and injuries (Groppa
et al. 2012). Therapeutically, TMS has been evaluated for movement disorders,
stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, consciousness
disorders, tinnitus, depression, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder,
schizophrenia, craving/addiction, and conversion(Lefaucheur et al. 2014). In a
recent review, Lefaucheur and coauthors concluded there is sufficient evidence to
accept “definite efficacy” for the analgesic effect of high-frequency (HF) TMS of
the primary motor cortex (M1) contralateral to the pain and the antidepressant effect
of HF-TMS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). “Probable efficacy”
is proposed for the antidepressant effect of low-frequency (LF) TMS of the right
DLPFC, HF-TMS of the left DLPFC for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia,
and LF-TMS of contralesional M1 in chronic motor stroke. Finally, TMS achieves
“possible efficacy” in a number of indications including LF-TMS of the left tempo-
roparietal cortex in tinnitus and auditory hallucinations (Lefaucheur et al. 2014).
7.2.5 Static/Permanent Magnetic Fields (SMF)
Time invariant – that is “static” – magnetic fields are a feature of various permanent
magnets; alternatively they can be generated by passing direct current (DC) through
a coil (Markov 2014). These fields – referred to “SMFs” (static magnetic fields) are
the primary focus of this book with a more detailed description of the underlying
physics provided in Chap. 1. In this chapter, SMFs will next be discussed based on
their field strengths with Sect. 7.3.1 covering weak fields in the range of the Earth’s
magnetic field (< 0.65 gauss or ~65 μT), Sect. 7.3.2 will discuss the *absence* of
these fields (which by default make a convincing case that humans can detect and
(subconsciously) respond to weak magnetic fields; and finally Sect. 7.3.3 will pro-
vide an overview of the therapeutic use of more powerful moderate strength fields
that range up to ~1 T (one Tesla or 10,000 gauss). Strong fields above one Tesla are
rarely used in magnetotherapy per se but people are exposed to these field strengths
during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) generally without any discernible impact
on health.

7.2.6 “Non-therapeutic” EMF Exposure Allays Safety
Concerns
Over the past century (or so) humans have been increasingly subject to inadvertent
exposure from “man-made” EMFs. For example, the rise of metal industries, weld-
ing processes, and certain electrified train systems in the late nineteenth centuries
resulted in significant exposure for workers and even bystanders to SMFs; in 1921
Drinker and Thomson asked the question “Does the magnetic field constitute an
industrial hazard?” and concluded that it didn’t (Hartwig et al. 2009). Over the years
as new “EMF”-based threats have emerged (Tucker and Schmitt 1978), such as liv-
ing under high voltage power lines or the ubiquitous adoption of cell phones, which
have raised fears of childhood and brain cancers, have been met with detailed scru-
tiny that have ruled out clear-cut evidence of harm. Ultimately meta-analysis of
many such studies has cast doubt on the idea that EMF exposure causes any measur-
able detriment to human health in a way helpful for establishing the safety of mag-
netotherapy. On the other hand, the (general) lack of deleterious effect of EMFs has
also been used to cast doubt on whether beneficial effects are possible based on the
assumption that these fields likely have no meaningful impact on human health; a
substantial portion of this chapter either directly or indirectly addresses this
fallacy.
7.3 Biomedical Effects of SMF Therapies Categorized
by Field Strength
7.3.1 “DIY” Treatments with Low to Moderate Strength SMFs
Are Widespread but Unproven
The largest segment of extant “magnetic therapies” falls into the do-it-yourself
(DIY) category where individuals use various types of permanent magnets that pro-
vide “always on” SMF exposure. This modality of magnetotherapy is used to treat
a wide range of ailments with a quick internet search (conducted in January, 2017,
but similar results have been obtained for at least 20 years) turning up magnetic
bedding pads, magnets embedded in pillows, magnetic shoe insoles, magnetic back
belts, magnetic leg and arm supports, magnetic bracelets, magnetic finger and toe
rings, and – to wrap this up – multipurpose magnetic pads that can be customized to
wear on virtually any part of the body. Note that no specific weblinks are provided
here for several reasons. First, any particular commercial link is apt to be quickly
out of date; second, this publication wishes to avoid the appearance of endorsing
any particular product; and finally, to spur any interested reader to perform their
own search for “magnetic therapy products” (or similar term). Such a search will
almost certainly provide – above and beyond many sites selling these

--- Page 209 ---

206 7 Prospects, Pitfalls, and Opportunities for Human Static Magnetic Field (SMF) Therapy
products – numerous links running the gamut from “debunking” the entire idea of
magnetotherapy and mocking consumers for falling for a billion dollar ‘scam”
(reportedly a conservative value for annual sales of these products, which was
reported almost 20 years ago (Weintraub 1999)) to enthusiastic endorsements for
efficacy against a broad gamut of human diseases; increasingly, products are com-
ing available to treat one’s pets as well!
Intuition alone makes a powerful case that many DIY magnetotherapy efforts are
likely misguided and minimally effective. Even if the magnets used are “high qual-
ity” (e.g., constructed from latest neodymium-based alloys) as advertised, with field
strengths reported in the range of tens to hundreds gauss (i.e., up two to three orders
of magnitude stronger than the Earth’s magnetic field), one key issue is that magnets
themselves are NOT therapeutic. This point is discussed by Markov (2009) who
describes how the term “magnetic therapy” is a misnomer. Instead, he emphasizes
that the therapeutic effects of magnets emanate from the fields they generate and the
subsequent interaction of these fields with the target tissue or organ in a person (note
that the use of the “magnetotherapy” in this chapter implicitly denotes magnetic
field therapy). In this regard, it is critical to note that field strength decreases expo-
nentially with distance from the surface of a permanent magnet (for example, by ~2
orders of magnitude in only a few millimeters for magnets in the range of hundreds
of gauss) and therefore field strength is negligible in deep tissue that would need to
be penetrated to have an effect on many of the conditions purportedly treated with
magnetotherapy.
One example of this pitfall is provided by a report where commercial magnetic
wraps had no effect on blood circulation in horses (Steyn et al. 2000) or pain percep-
tion in people (Kuipers et al. 2007), which – because the field strengths used did not
penetrate effectively into tissue to the depth where the target vessels or nerves were
located – were not surprising results. More trivially, but still important, magnets
placed in clothing or otherwise attached via wrappings that surround the body pro-
vide inconsistent magnetic field exposure to the intended target tissue if the clothing
or wrapping is loose or not applied and worn consistently from day to day. An illus-
tration of this point is that the field strength of a 500 gauss magnet can be as little as
1 gauss only one or two centimeters away from the magnet’s surface. As a result,
determination of dose – a key parameter in determining medical efficacy – is typi-
cally impossible to determine with any degree of accuracy in DIY magnetotherapy
(Markov 2009).
7.3.2 Hypomagnetic Fields (HMF) – Evidence
for Magnetotherapy by Default?
Interestingly, the impact of weak (to moderately strong) SMF on human health per-
haps has been demonstrated most convincingly by default; that is, by observing the
effects of the absence of geomagnetic strength magnetic fields. These studies have

--- Page 210 ---

7.3 B iomedical Effects of SMF Therapies Categorized by Field Strength 207
exploited a century of efforts to develop materials designed to shield sensitive
equipment from magnetic fields, such as submarine telegraph cables, electric power
transformers, cathode ray tubes, and magnetic phonograph cartridges. To achieve
the required shielding, “mu-metals” have been developed that have a representative
composition of ~77% nickel, 16% iron, 5% copper and 2% chromium or molybde-
num (Jiles 1998). In essence, a mu-metal is a high permeability alloy that does not
block magnetic fields per se, but instead provides a path for the magnetic field lines
to go around the area intended to be shielded. Details on magnetic field shielding are
largely beyond the scope of this discussion but more information can be found
online (e.g., in technical documents provided by vendors of magnetic shield prod-
ucts such as http://www.magnetic-shield.com/pdf/how_do_magnetic_shields_
work.pdf). For this discussion, the key point is that products exist that can effectively
shield objects from ambient magnetic fields that for practical purposes can isolate a
research subject from a background (generally the Earth’s) magnetic field.
Geomagnetic field shielding produces what has come to be known as “hypomag-
netic fields” (HMFs).
In the past few years a provocative set of experiments have emerged that HMF
has numerous biological and biomedical effects across species up to and including
in people. For example, long-term HMF exposure is associated with embryonic
malformation in insects (Wan et al. 2014), amphibians (e.g., newts (Asashima et al.
1991) and frogs (Mo et al. 2012)), and rodents (e.g., mice (Fesenko et al. 2010)).
Additional effects of HMF have been described in rodents including inhibition of
stress-induced analgesia (Prato et al. 2005) and decreased noradrenaline release
(Choleris et al. 2002; Zhang et al. 2007) and learning defects have been described
in birds (Xu et al. 2003) and Drosophila (Zhang et al. 2004). Finally, the negative
impact of HMF has been reported to extend to humans; these effects have often and
most convincingly been deduced from space flight where the geomagnetic field is
negligible in strength because it generally is not practical to confine a person to
artificially-shielded HMF area. These studies have shown HMF effects in humans
that include perturbed circadian rhythms (Bliss and Heppner 1976; Wever 1970)
and weakened cognitive function (Binhi and Sarimov 2009).
The generally deleterious effects of HMF across several biological processes in
many species, including the still-speculative but nevertheless plausible observations
in people, have strengthened the case that weak magnetic fields do have legitimate
biomedical relevance. For example, it appears that GMFs keep us healthy and con-
tribute to normal physiology. Extrapolating from these observations, it has been
hypothesized that because a lack of magnetic fields is harmful, field strengths stron-
ger than the Earth’s magnetic field might exacerbate and extend the beneficial
impact of GMF exposure. A parallel drawn from pharmacology is that many natural
“drugs” such as aspirin or the antioxidant resveratrol must be consumed at much
higher levels to have a medical effect than a person can reasonably obtain from
natural consumption (Scott et al. 2012). Similarly, arguments have been made –
abutted with claims that humans evolved when the Earth’s magnetic field was as
much as an order of magnitude stronger than it is today (the earth’s magnetic field
is constantly waxing and waning, and even reverses polarity on a millions-of-years

208 7 Prospects, Pitfalls, and Opportunities for Human Static Magnetic Field (SMF) Therapy
time scale (Mori et al. 2013), an event associated with mass extinctions (Lipowski
and Lipowska 2006)) – that to achieve maximum benefits from magnetotherapy,
stronger magnetic fields should (or even “must”) be used.
7.3.3 Stronger Magnetic Fields – Impacts on Human Health
7.3.3.1 Moderate Strength SMF Therapy
The benefits (or necessity) of using stronger than GMF-strength fields for human
therapy have spurred efforts to use static magnetic fields much stronger than afforded
naturally by today’s geomagnetic fields. In some cases, these strategies involves
“DIY” efforts with magnets in the tens to hundreds of milli-Tesla range, but, as
discussed above, these efforts are likely ineffective for treatments that require deep
penetration of tissue. As an alternative, medical devices, often from Europe, that
create stronger electromagnetic fields have been marketed. The United States FDA
generally permits these for “general wellness” (Anonymous 2015) while prohibit-
ing claims for efficacy for treatment of any specific medical indication.
In some cases, proponents of magnetic therapy are pursuing more rigorous evi-
dence of efficacy. One example is provided by continuing efforts of Joe Kirschvink
and colleagues (as discussed in more detail in Chap. 3) to demonstrate that humans
are affected by externally applied magnetic field in ways that are medically-relevant
(Hand 2016). Another example of moving forward with therapeutic intervention is
provided by the Advanced Magnetic Research Institute (AMRi) that has developed
a “Magnetic Molecular Energizer™” (MME) device (Bonlie 2001) capable of pro-
ducing SMFs of 0.3–0.5 T that completely penetrate the human body in an ~20 cm
radius (Fig. 7.1). Based on the assumption that the “biosensor” for magnetic recep-
tion is located directly in the diseased or damaged tissue, a patient is position with
field centered on the affected area. Double blind clinical trials seemingly showed
efficacy against lower back pain (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00325377) and
possibly against symptoms of diabetic neuropathy (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:
NCT00134524). The results of these studies, however, were difficult to interpret
because positive outcomes were not statistically different from placebo-treated
patients, who also experienced marked improvement (Dean Bonlie, personal com-
munication). These clinical studies illustrate two recurring themes in efforts to
establish clinical efficacy for magnetotherapy; first, therapeutic effectiveness is
most well established for pain perception (the subject of these tests) and second, the
placebo effect is often overwhelming in magnetotherapy; both of these points are
further elaborated in Sect. 7.5.3, below.

Fig. 7.1 The Molecular Magnetic Enegizer™ (MME) device and illustration of a patient
during treatment. (a) The MME (as illustrated in U.S. Patent documents (Bonlie 2001)) consists
of two major elements: a magnetic field generator (32) for producing a treating magnetic field and
a patient support (34) for positioning a patient within the magnetic field. The magnetic field gen-
erator consists of a magnetic circuit (35) having an upper electromagnet (36) and a lower electro-
magnet (38) separated by a gap (40) on their adjacent pole faces (42) and connected by a C-shaped
core (44) (or “C-core”) on their opposing poles (46). In the embodiment shown C-core has a cir-
cular cross section with an 8 inch (20.3 cm) diameter. The electromagnets are wired in parallel with
a power supply to create magnetic fields of the same sense. For example, the positive pole of the
upper electromagnet 36 would face the negative pole of the lower electromagnet 38 (or vice versa).
(b) A patient is shown positioned in the MME device in a supine position; it should be noted that
the magnetic field generator apparatus can be rotated and otherwise adjusted via parts 48, 50, and
52 to accommodate patients who prefer to treated in other positions, for example, lying on their
side

7.3.3.2 Higher Strength SMF Exposure
Strong fields above one Tesla are rarely used in magnetotherapy per se but people
routinely are exposed to field strengths of 1.3 (and now up to 3) T during magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). As of 2016, over 150 million people have undergone
MRI procedures with ~10 million undergoing examination each year (Anonymous
2016). Overall, it is accepted that MRI has little if any discernible impact on health
either beneficial or deleterious (Schenck 2000). Based on this apparent lack of
response, SMFs are generally regarded to be safe by regulatory agencies such as the
United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (Anonymous 2015). Upon
comprehensive review of the literature available described the in vivo and ex vivo
effects of SMFs, Hartwig and coauthors confirmed that >1 T SMFs that accompany
MRI are rarely harmful (Hartwig et al. 2009) with the possible exception of incon-
clusive reports where exposure led to acute neurobehavioral effects, such as eye–
hand coordination speed and visual and auditory working memory problems (De
Vocht et al. 2006) and a non statistically significant increase in spontaneous abor-
tions in MRI workers (Evans et al. 1993). It should be noted that these reports dealt
with MRI workers and, no doubt based on warnings raised by these speculative
studies, safety standards have been tightened and follow-up and continuing prob-
lems have not been reported.
7.4 Prospects for Three Therapeutic Areas
Magnetotherapy has been applied to almost any imaginable human ailment. For
example, MedicineNet (http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.
asp?articlekey=22961) summarizes conditions claimed to be diagnosed or treated
using magnetic field therapy (largely through the “DIY” methods mentioned above)
to include arthritis, cancer, circulatory disorders, diabetic neuropathy (nerve dis-
ease), fibromyalgia, HIV/AIDS, immune dysfunction, infection, inflammation,
insomnia, multiple sclerosis, muscle pain, neuropathy, pain, rheumatoid arthritis,
sciatica, stress and to increase energy and prolong life. The abovementioned AMRi
Corporation, which utilizes stronger strength SMF therapy, is investigating the
treatment of ailments that range from spinal cord injury, brain injury, stroke impair-
ment, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, Parkinson’s disease,
Alzheimer’s disease, congestive heart failure, to orthopedic conditions involving
bone and joint repair. As described in Sect. 7.5 below, many find it implausible that
a “one size fits all” treatment could be effective against so many indications and this
doubt in part contributes to disbelief in therapeutic efficacy for magnetic field expo-
sure. However, as discussed next, pain perception, blood flow and effects on the
cardiovascular system, as well as the impact on cells found in the neurological sys-
tem provide a compelling scientific basis for beneficial effects of SMFs that, if care-
fully and rigorously translated to the clinic, hold legitimate promise for human

--- Page 214 ---

7.4 P rospects for Three Therapeutic Areas 211
therapy (cancer is another similar area that is covered in detail in Chap. 6 of this
book).
7.4.1 Pain Perception
A substantial body of evidence has accumulated showing that exposure to EMFs
affects pain sensitivity (nociception) and pain inhibition (analgesia); in particular
acute exposure to various EMFs have been shown to inhibit analgesia in many stud-
ies (Del Seppia et al. 2007). In some studies, however, depending of the duration,
intensity, frequency, and repeated nature of EMF exposure, increased analgesia has
actually been observed (Del Seppia et al. 2007). While many of these studies – con-
ducted in diverse organisms ranging from snails to mice to people – have involved
time-varying fields, there is also substantial evidence that SMFs can affect pain
perception. These findings have most convincingly come from HMF studies where
mice apparently detect and respond to the absence of the ambient geomagnetic field.
In a pioneering study, mice experienced a maximum analgesic response after 4–6
days of exposure (Prato et al. 2005). Follow up studies showed a more complex
biphasic response, where geomagnetic shielding for 1 h per day for 10 consecutive
days initially decreased the pain threshold over the first 2 days, followed by a sharp
increase peaking by the fifth day, with a return to pre-exposure values within 8 days
(Del Seppia et al. 2007). Interestingly, the kinetics of this response roughly mirror
an in vitro cell-based assay response to moderate strength SMF (Wang et al. 2009)
described in more detail below in Sect. 7.4.3.
7.4.2 Blood Flow/Vascularization
As discussed in more detail in Chap. 3, beneficial effects of magnetotherapy in
humans often have been attributed to improved blood flow. Although many of the
“internet” claims in this regard are nonsensical, for example the idea that a magnetic
field attracts the iron in the blood is based on the misconception that hemoglobin is
ferromagnetic. Instead, iron in oxygenated blood is diamagnetic which means there
is a real, but almost negligible force, repelling the blood; on the other hand, deoxy-
genated blood is paramagnetic which means there will be a similarly almost negli-
gible force attracting the blood (Zborowski et al. 2003). Either way, these effects are
dwarfed by thermal motion and the ambient flow of the blood (as discussed in more
detail in Chap. 3). Nevertheless, there is evidence – although inconclusive because
of many conflicting or inclusive studies – that magnetic fields can legitimately mod-
ulate blood flow in humans (or other mammals). As an aside, some “negative”
results can be accounted for by the trivial explanation that the magnetic fields used
were not strong enough to penetrate deeply into the tissue where the target blood
vessels were used. One example with horses was mentioned above (Steyn et al.

--- Page 215 ---

212 7 Prospects, Pitfalls, and Opportunities for Human Static Magnetic Field (SMF) Therapy
2000) and similarly, a study using 500 gauss (0.05 T) fields to measure blood flow
in the forearms of healthy young men was equally ineffective (Martel et al. 2002);
this is not surprising because field strength would be two to three orders of magni-
tude lower at the location of the targeted blood vessels embedded in tissue. A ~
10-fold larger field (4042 gauss, or ~0.4 T), by contrast, did statistically affect blood
flow in treated fingers (Mayrovitz and Groseclose 2005); interestingly this effect
actually was a reduction in blood flow, which is against the direction generally
thought to be therapeutically beneficial.
A set of studies in rabbits using similar strength fields (i.e., ~0.18–0.25 T) also
showed legitimate effects of SMFs on blood flow (Gmitrov et al. 2002; Okano and
Ohkubo 2001; Xu et al. 1998). These three studies demonstrated a biphasic response
of blood flow where exposure enhanced vasodilation when the vessels were vaso-
constricted and enhanced vasoconstriction in vessels that were vasodilated; in other
words, the SMFs appeared to work to maintain circulatory homeostasis and “nor-
malize” vascular function. A conceptually similar normalization effect was observed
in mice where the impact of surgical intervention that would otherwise cause lumi-
nal diameter expansion in vascular networks was abrogated by continual exposure
to SMFs over 4–7 days (Morris and Skalak 2007). Together, these studies suggest
that while SMF exposure does have an interesting effect on blood flow, it likely is
not mediated through magnetic or inductive effects on iron containing molecules
(hemoglobin) or cells (RBCs) per se.
Instead therapeutic effects on blood flow are likely mediated by “non-canonical”
mechanisms (i.e., *not* magnetite, chemomagnetic sensing, or inductive mecha-
nisms, which are the three molecular mechanisms found throughout nature in many
diverse organisms as discussed in detail in Chap. 3). Another interesting feature of
these studies is that field strengths of greater than ~0.1 T (1000 gauss) were needed
for efficacy; as mentioned the simple explanation is that weaker field strengths
could not penetrate deeply enough into tissue to reach the intended site of action
(i.e., the blood vessels themselves). Another explanation (again as discussed in
more detail in Chap. 3), is that field strengths of ~0.2 T or higher can alter the bio-
physical properties of lipid assemblies (Braganza et al. 1984). As a result, the prop-
erties of lipid biolayers (i.e., biological membranes) are affected in ways that
putatively explain many phenonema observed in magnetotherapy. For example
changes in ion flux could reasonably be explained by allosteric changes to ion chan-
nels brought about changes to the biophysical properties of membranes rather than
the less plausible explanation that SMF directly affects the movement of ions (i.e.,
through an inductive or “Hall effect,” which has sometimes been postulated to
explain the mechanism of magnetotherapy). Similarly, changes to signal pathway
activity can be explained by the effects of magnetic field exposure on the biophysi-
cal properties of membranes, as discussed below for neural cells). Both of these
topics are discussed in the next section in the context of studies performed in the
author’s laboratory.

7.4.3 In Vitro Evidence for Treatment of Neurological Disease
and Neural Regeneration
In a study that was inspired by the need to find a scientific basis for coalescing evi-
dence that magnetic field therapy may be a viable treatment option for neurological
ailments through the use of moderate strength fields (i.e., 0.1–1 Tesla), we treated
the PC12 rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cell line with ~0.25 T SMFs. PC12 cells
display metabolic features of Parkinson’s disease (PD) (Blum et al. 2000; Meng
et al. 2007) such as possessing intracellular substrates for dopamine (DA) synthesis,
metabolism, and transport and they also abundantly express adenosine A receptors
2A
(e.g., A R) implicated in PD (Kobayashi et al. 1998). In these studies we showed
2A
that SMF treatment reproduced several responses elicited by ZM241385, a selective
A R antagonist; SMF exposure also counteracted several PD-relevant endpoints
2A
exacerbated by A R agonist CGS21680 in a manner similar to ZM241385 (Wang
2A
et al. 2010). These results raise the intriguing hypothesis that SMF can reproduce
the effects of a promising class of non-dopaminergic PD drugs (i.e., ZM241385 and
analogues) in a non-invasive manner and, more broadly, hold potential for amelio-
rating additional neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s dis-
eases through modulation of A R (Takahashi et al. 2008).
2A
In a second study from the author’s laboratory, SMF-mediated responses associ-
ated with transient interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling in human embryonic cells (the
hEBD LVEC line (Shamblott et al. 2001)[as outlined in detail in Chap. 3]) trans-
lated into changes observable at the whole cell level (Wang et al. 2009). The
response(s) observed in these cells began very rapidly after SMF exposure began,
first observed within 15–30 min in increased transcription of mRNA for IL-6 with
actual secretion of this pro-inflammatory cytokine increasing for the next 2–4 days.
Because IL-6 guides differentiation of neural stem cells primarily to astrocytes
(Taga and Fukuda 2006) – which is generally a medically-unwanted outcome
because hyperproliferation of this cell type leads to scar formation rather than
regeneration – we investigated whether evidence of astrocytogenesis was seen in
SMF-treated cells. Interestingly, responses consistent with astroctye differentiation
(i.e., slowed proliferation and morphological changes) expected from IL-6 exposure
were not seen; neither were biochemical markers of astrocyte differentiation
(Fig. 7.2a). Instead, markers found in neurons (Fig. 7.2b) and oligodendrocytes
were manifest (Fig. 7.2c, d), indicating that the other pathways modulated by SMFs
(nine other signaling pathways besides IL-6 were affected by SMF exposure in this
study (Wang et al. 2009)) tuned – and in fact reversed – the usual, and most-often
unwanted, pro-inflammatory activity of IL-6. Ultimately, if oligodendrocyte forma-
tion can be promoted in vivo by SMF treatment without concomitant scar-forming
astrocyte enhancement, this capability could lead to non-invasive therapies for con-
ditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS) that are linked to oligodendrocyte
pathologies.

Fig. 7.2 SMF treatment reverses astrocyte differentiation in hEBD LVEC (human embry-
onic) cells (Adapted from Wang et al. 2009). In these experiments cells were treated with 4.0 ng/
ml IL-6 and exposed to SMFs (control cells received neither stimuli) and the monolayers were
co-stained with Oregon Green 488 phalloidin to visualize actin, the nuclear dye DAPI (blue), and
one of the following markers (red). In Panel (a) the GFAP astrocyte marker was absent from both
the control and treated cells (IL-6 treatment alone causes up-regulation, not shown). Panel (b)
shows the neuron marker NEF and Panels (c) and (d) show expression of the pre-oligodendrocyte
markers (c) Vim and (d) Gal-C, respectively upon combined IL-6 and SMF treatment (Images

7.5 Pitfalls with SMF Clinical Studies and Acceptance
of Magnetotherapy
7.5.1 Hyperbolic and Ambiguous Claims vs. Outright
Rejection of Magnetotherapy
It can be a daunting task to precisely match treatment parameters to various patho-
logical indications even for long-standing medicines. For example, it has taken a
century to understand how to fully exploit aspirin as a medicine; indeed, some
aspects of this drug remain poorly understood. For example, at a pharmacological
level, the need for esterase processing of aspirin is not fully elucidated (Lavis 2008).
However much is known, including how higher doses delivered over short time
intervals aspirin have anti-inflammatory and pain relief effects while lower does
when administered consistently over time, it appear to reduce the risk of cardiovas-
cular disease. On the other hand, no evidence exists that aspirin is effective against
many other conditions, for example, pancreatic cancer or a neurological disorder
such as Alzheimer’s disease. Aspirin is again used here to illustrate pitfalls – and
lessons to be learned – for magnetic field therapy. Just as aspirin, if tested against a

wrong medical indication – or at the wrong dose or duration – could be easily be
proven to have no effect does not mean that it has no benefit for other ailments.
Similarly, magnetic field therapy should not be considered to be debunked if a cer-
tain treatment modality shows no effect against a certain ailment; indeed, to the
contrary, careful compiling of conditions that do not work could be extremely help-
ful in guiding treatments towards diseases and other ailments where the magneto-
therapy does work.
Unfortunately, the efficacy of magnetic therapy has been clouded by ambiguity
that results in large part from study design, as illustrated by a review of over 50 stud-
ies a decade ago (Colbert et al. 2007, 2009). In these studies, only two provided
sufficiently-detailed experimental protocols to actually reproduce the work;
although a more recent systematically-analyzed compilation of studies does not
appear to be available, anecdotal perusal of the literature over the past decade sug-
gests that the problem of incomplete reporting of experimental conditions persists
up to today. As Markov forcefully editorializes, until parameters used in magnetic
field therapy – starting at a very basic terminology level to overcome confusion over
semantic differences between “magnetic therapy” and “magnetic field therapy”
(i.e., magnets themselves have no therapeutic effect but the fields they produce
do) – magnetotherapy is apt to remain marginalized and not fully accepted by the
mainstream scientific and medical communities (Markov 2009). Indeed, Markov
(and his colleagues) have been trying to educate about these issues for at least two
decades, and in that vein, has proposed a set of parameters that must be considered
and clearly defined; these endpoints are discussed next in Sect. 7.5.2.
7.5.2 Parameters Necessary to Be Controlled
in Magnetotherapy
The variety of commercially-available EMF devices – often with poorly character-
ized and sometimes misrepresented field strength specifications – makes it difficult
to compare the physical and engineering characteristics of any particular device
used in any reported study, thus providing significant obstacles for analysis of clini-
cal efficacy. Markov outlines a set of parameters that must be controlled, defined
(and reported!) to be able to be able to evaluate magnetotherapy outcomes (Markov
2009); these are:
• Type of field
• Intensity or induction
• Spatial Gradient (dB/dx)
• Localization
• Time of exposure
• Depth of penetration
• Temporary change (dB/dt)
• Frequency

• Pulse shape
• Component (electric or magnetic).
• An attraction of SMF therapy is that the latter four parameters (indicated in ital-
ics) are not in play, thereby simplifying evaluation of this therapeutic modality,
and in theory, increasing the reproducibility of the studies.
7.5.3 The Placebo Effect
As already alluded to above, pain response was the only medical outcome where
magnetic fields unambiguously had a beneficial therapeutic effects based on the
bulk of the literature reviewed by Del Seppia and coauthors a decade ago (Del
Seppia et al. 2007). Many of the relevant studies were performed in animals, often
rodents, where there presumably is no placebo effect but in humans placebo response
cannot be discounted so easily. Indeed, difficulties in establishing benefits of mag-
netic therapy result in good part from designing experiments that account for the
placebo effect. For example, a study from 1978 describes “the extreme cleverness
with which perceptive individuals unintentionally used subtle auxiliary clues to
develop impressive records of apparent magnetic field detection” (Tucker and
Schmitt 1978). Of course, in many cases, not even “extreme cleverness” is for a test
subject to figure out whether they are part of the placebo control arm of a study
because real magnets have a propensity to attract loose magnetically-susceptible
objects such as paper clips.
As discussed earlier, evidence suggests that deep-penetrating SMFs of at least
0.2 T are required to affect the biophysical properties of membranes (Braganza et al.
1984) implicated in therapeutic responses in humans at the cell level (Wang et al.
2009; 2010). The only plausible way to deliver these fields in a deeply-penetrating
manner is to use electrical coils to generate the required moderate strength (e.g.,
0.3–0.5 T) magnetic fields. One example of such an instrument is the MME device
(Fig. 7.1) developed by AMRi (Bonlie 2001), which requires seven miles of copper
coils situated above and below a patient (the entire apparatus is close two storeys in
height). In theory, pitfalls that befall efforts to conduct controlled clinical trials
using DIY-type wearable magnets (such as attracting, or not attracting) loose paper-
clips during everyday activities can be avoided by strictly monitoring the treatment
environment. In reality, however, when in operation, electricity running through the
device needed to generate the SMFs creates a perceptible humming noise, making
it obvious whether or whether or not actual treatment is underway. As a result, con-
trol subjects in double blind clinical studies (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:
NCT00325377 and NCT00134524) were subject to recorded MME device noise.
Interestingly – and perhaps unsurprisingly – a large placebo effect was observed in
these studies that plausibly can be explained by the belief of control subjects that
they were undergoing legitimate SMF exposure.

--- Page 220 ---

References 217
The placebo effect – evidenced by sham-treated test subjects experiencing
improvement to long-standing conditions (lower back pain and diabetic neuropa-
thy) that were not responsive to conventional medical treatment at rates comparable
to SMF-treated individuals – illustrates the growing realization that placebo treat-
ment is not equivalent to “no treatment.” Briefly, placebo effect depends on belief in
the effectiveness of the treatment; in fact, the opposite “nocebo” effect has been
proposed where a patient who disbelieves in a treatment may experience a worsen-
ing of symptoms (Kennedy 1961). Of note, “belief” is a rather ambiguous concept
but in theory can be converted into physiological modulation through opoid neu-
rotransmitters whose endogenous production is controlled by the brain.
The placebo effect can be powerful, with attempts to objectively measure its
contribution to medical intervention overall ranging from 30 to 40% of overall
observed effects of a medicine. The impact of the placebo effect varies amongst
treatment modalities and disease conditions with one of the stronger responses
reported for the effects of antitussive medicines in patients with acute upper respira-
tory tract infections. In these patients, 85% of the reduction in coughing was linked
to the placebo effect and only 15% to the actual physiological effects of the pharma-
cological agents (Eccles 2002). It appears that the placebo effect might be equally
pervasive and influential in response to SMF treatments and (in a lesson being
learned from psychiatry (Horgan 2013)) the field should consider embracing –
rather than being embarrassed – by this aspect of magnetotherapy.
7.6 Concluding Comments
This chapter describes various modes of EMF therapy, with the main focus on
SMFs. Up to now, this therapeutic modality has both shown promise and has been
downplayed, in part due to over-enthusiastic claims by its practitioners. Accordingly,
strict guidelines have been proposed to maintain “quality control” when patients are
being treated with magnetotherapy in efforts to rigorously establish efficacy against
specific medical indications, several of which are mentioned and described in some
detail (e.g., pain perception and management, blood flow and vascularization, and
neurological regeneration in Sect. 7.4 of this chapter, as well as cancer in Chap. 6 of
this book).
