Magnetic field effects (MFEs) on the triplet sensitization ofp-aminophenyl disulfide were investigated in a
sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) micellar solution by means ofa nanosecond laser flashphotolysis technique at
high magnetic fields up to 10 T. The yield of the escaped (p-aminophenyl)thiyl radical increased steeply
with increasing magnetic field strength (B) from 0 to 1 T, but decreased gradually from 1 to 10 T. At 10 T,
theyieldofthe escapedradicalbecame similarto that at0T. TheMFEs observedatboth low (B < 1 T) and
high (IT < B < 10 T) fields were simultaneously quenched by the addition of a paramagnetic Gd3+ ion.
Thus, these reverted MFEs were interpreted by the relaxation mechanism through anisotropic hyperfine and
Zeeman interactions.

we setour photomultiplierfarfromthemagnet andguided our

Magnetic fields were measured by an F. W. Bell 9200
Gaussmeterwithan FAR92-1815 probe. Thelowestmagnetic
field generated by a counter current for canceling the residual
field was less than 0.2 mT. Hereafter, the experiments under
the lowest magnetic field are denoted as those in the absence

ESR Spectra. ESR spectra were taken on a JEOL-RE3X
ESR spectrometer at —160 °C. Microcrystalline APDS was
sealed in aquartztube ( 4 mm) underargon atmosphere. The
irradiation of the sample was carried out using a Xe lamp
(USHIO Electric Co., Type UXL-500D). The g values were
determined with the Mn2+/MgO signals observed simulta-

As shown in Figure 2, the A(t) curves of NF^PhS* were
appreciably changed by magnetic fields. The decay of NH2-

was accelerated with increasing B from 1.0 to 10 T. At 10 T,
