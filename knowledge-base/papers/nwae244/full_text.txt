Spin-related excited-state phenomena in photochemistry
ChuangZhang 1 , † ,ChenYe2 , † ,JiannianYao1 andLi-ZhuWu 2 , ∗
ABSTRACT
The spin of electrons plays a vital role in chemical reactions and processes, and the excited state generated by
the absorption of photons shows abundant spin-related phenomena. However, the importance of electron
spin in photochemistry studies has been rarely mentioned or summarized. In this review, we briefly
introduce the concept of spin photochemistry based on the spin multiplicity of the excited state, which leads
to the observation of various spin-related photophysical properties and photochemical reactivities. Then,
we focus on the recent advances in terms of light-induced magnetic properties, excited-state
magneto-optical effects and spin-dependent photochemical reactions. The review aims to provide a
comprehensive overview to utilize the spin multiplicity of the excited state in manipulating the above
