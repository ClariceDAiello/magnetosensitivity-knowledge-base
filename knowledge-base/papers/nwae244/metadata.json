  "abstract": "The spin of electrons plays a vital role in chemical reactions and processes, and the excited state generated by\nthe absorption of photons shows abundant spin-related phenomena. However, the importance of electron\nspin in photochemistry studies has been rarely mentioned or summarized. In this review, we briefly\nintroduce the concept of spin photochemistry based on the spin multiplicity of the excited state, which leads\nto the observation of various spin-related photophysical properties and photochemical reactivities. Then,\nwe focus on the recent advances in terms of light-induced magnetic properties, excited-state\nmagneto-optical effects and spin-dependent photochemical reactions. The review aims to provide a\ncomprehensive overview to utilize the spin multiplicity of the excited state in manipulating the above\n1 Key Laboratory of photophysical and photochemical processes. Finally, we discuss the existing challenges in the emerging field\nPhotochemistry,\nof spin photochemistry and future",
