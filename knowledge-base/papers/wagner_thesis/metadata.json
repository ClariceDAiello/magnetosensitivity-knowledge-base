Themodulationoftheanisotropic\nhyperfine interaction by rotational motion of the constituent radicals is identified as the most\nsignificant relaxation mechanism; this is the mechanism investigated here in a range of systems\nwithin two complementary theoretical approaches, Redfield theory and a theory based on the\nstochasticLiouvilleequation(SLE).\nThethesiscommenceswithanintroductiontospinchemistryandradicalpairreactions. The\nquantum mechanical formalism required for the treatment of relaxation is set out. A unified\nrelaxation theory is then presented; care is taken throughout to demonstrate its validity under\nD\npreviously not considered low-field conditions.
