## Abstract

Thisthesispresentsforthefirsttimearigorousandsystematicstudyofrelaxationeffectson
radicalrecombinationreactionsinweakstaticmagneticfields. Themodulationoftheanisotropic
hyperfine interaction by rotational motion of the constituent radicals is identified as the most
significant relaxation mechanism; this is the mechanism investigated here in a range of systems
within two complementary theoretical approaches, Redfield theory and a theory based on the
stochasticLiouvilleequation(SLE).
Thethesiscommenceswithanintroductiontospinchemistryandradicalpairreactions. The
quantum mechanical formalism required for the treatment of relaxation is set out. A unified
relaxation theory is then presented; care is taken throughout to demonstrate its validity under
D
previously not considered low-field conditions. A compact formulation in terms of Wigner -
functionsandsphericaltensoroperatorsisdevelopedforthetime-dependentHamiltonian. This
is crucial for the evaluation of the correlation functions required
