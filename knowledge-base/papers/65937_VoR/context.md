## Abstract

Molecular spins provide potential building units for future quantum
information science and spintronic technologies. In particular, doublet (S = 1/ ) and
2
triplet (S = 1) molecular spin states have the potential for excellent optical and spin
propertiesfortheseapplicationsifusefulphoton-spinmechanismsatroomtemperature
can be devised. Here we explore the potential of exploiting reversible energy transfer

polarization. We investigate the dependence of the photon-spin mechanism on the
magnitude and sign of the exchange interaction between the doublet and triplet spin
components in amorphous and crystalline model systems. The design of a magnetic
field inclination sensor is proposed from understanding the required “structure” (spin
interactions) to “function” (magnetosensitivity).
Doublet (S = 1/ ) and triplet (S = 1) spin states from In our recent work, we showed that the interplay of trip- 2
molecules provide p
