ABSTRACT: Molecular spins provide potential building units for future quantum
information science and spintronic technologies. In particular, doublet (S = 1/ ) and

polarization. We investigate the dependence of the photon-spin mechanism on the
magnitude and sign of the exchange interaction between the doublet and triplet spin
components in amorphous and crystalline model systems. The design of a magnetic
field inclination sensor is proposed from understanding the required “structure” (spin
interactions) to “function” (magnetosensitivity).
