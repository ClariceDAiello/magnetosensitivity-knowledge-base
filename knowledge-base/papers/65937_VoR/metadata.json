In particular, doublet (S = 1/ ) and\n2\ntriplet (S = 1) molecular spin states have the potential for excellent optical and spin\npropertiesfortheseapplicationsifusefulphoton-spinmechanismsatroomtemperature\ncan be devised.

We investigate the dependence of the photon-spin mechanism on the\nmagnitude and sign of the exchange interaction between the doublet and triplet spin\ncomponents in amorphous and crystalline model systems. The design of a magnetic\nfield inclination sensor is proposed from understanding the required “structure” (spin\ninteractions) to “function” (magnetosensitivity).\nDoublet (S = 1/ ) and triplet (S = 1) spin states from In our recent work, we showed that the interplay of trip- 2\nmolecules provide p",
