Magnetic fields as weak as the Earth’s can change the yields of radical pair reactions even though the energies involved
are orders of magnitude smaller than the thermal energy, k T, at room temperature. Proposed as the source of the light-
B
dependent magnetic compass in migratory birds, the radical pair mechanism is thought to operate in cryptochrome
flavoproteins in the retina. Here we demonstrate that the primary magnetic field effect on flavin photoreactions can be
amplified chemically byslow radical termination reactions underconditions of continuous photoexcitation. The nature and
origin of the amplification are revealed by studies of the intermolecular flavin–tryptophan and flavin–ascorbic acid
photocycles and the closely related intramolecular flavin–tryptophan radical pair in cryptochrome. Amplification factors of
up to 5.6 were observed for magnetic fields weaker than 1mT. Substantial chemical amplification could have a significant
