Quantum biology is the study of quantum effects on biochemical mechanisms and biological function.
We show that the biological production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in live cells can be influenced
by coherent electron spin dynamics, providing a new example of quantum biology in cellular regulation.
ROS partitioning appears to be mediated during the activation of molecular oxygen (O ) by reduced
2
flavoenzymes, forming spin-correlated radical pairs (RPs). We find that oscillating magnetic fields at
Zeeman resonance alter relative yields of cellular superoxide (O •−) and hydrogen peroxide (H O )
2 2 2
ROS products, indicating coherent singlet-triplet mixing at the point of ROS formation. Furthermore,
the orientation-dependence of magnetic stimulation, which leads to specific changes in ROS levels,
increases either mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis rates. Our results reveal quantum effects
in live cell cultures that bridge atomic and cellular levels by connecting ROS partitioning to cellular
bioenergetics.
Quantum biology may be thought of as the signatures of molecular-level quantum phenomena observed in bio-
logical systems at functional, cellular, or organism levels1,2. For example, quantum effects in biological systems
have been implicated in mechanisms for avian navigation3–7, olfactory sensing8,9, and photosynthesis10–12. Here,
we present results that reveal a novel domain of quantum biology: the control of the biological production of reac-
tive oxygen species (ROS) via coherent spin dynamics in a radical pair (RP) reaction. Our work builds on studies
of complexes between reduced flavoenzymes and molecular oxygen13,14, within the context of quantum biology15
and the radical pair mechanism (RPM)16,17.
The RPM offers an attractive foundation to explain how quantum effects can influence biochemical ROS pro-
duction. At the heart of the RPM lies a coherent singlet-triplet interconversion (Fig. 1), driven by the dynamical
mixing of the spin eigenstates of coupled free-radicals. The RP spin dynamics are governed by internal magnetic
interactions, usually electron-nuclear hyperfine interactions (HFIs) and applied magnetic fields. External static
and oscillating magnetic fields can alter RP spin dynamics by Zeeman and HFI resonance effects, and thereby
change the relative yields of reaction products that derive, alternatively, from singlet and triplet RP states18,19. The
product yields will depend on the strength of the static field and on the frequency, amplitude, and orientation (rel-
ative to the static field) of the applied oscillating magnetic field17. These experimental parameters can be adjusted
to alter the relative ROS product yields in vitro. In this work, we demonstrate magnetic field-induced changes in
ROS levels that leave a metabolic signature at the cellular level. We report the effects of the orientation of oscillat-
ing fields on the ROS reaction yields in cell cultures and the impact of the resulting variations in the ROS products
on the regulation of cellular bioenergetics.
We assume that magnetically sensitive ROS formation occurs at flavoenzyme centers (Fig. 1), initialized by an
electron transfer that activates molecular oxygen (O) in reduced flavoenyzmes20. A triplet-born, spin-correlated

RP is created between flavin semiquinone (FADH•) and superoxide (O•−)21,22. The FADH•:O•− intermediate
2 2
is a branch point for ROS products, where subsequent spin-selective reactions have two competing pathways.
Either O•− is released from the triplet RP state and escapes into the medium, or a hydroperoxy-flavin transient

is formed from the singlet RP state. A subsequent second electron transfer releases hydrogen peroxide (HO).
2 2
Besides kinetic requirements22, the coherent evolution between the singlet and triplet states of FADH•:O•− RP
2
determines the amount of the products for the two reaction channels. We hypothesize that RP spin dynamics can
be altered by external static and oscillating magnetic fields23, which change singlet-triplet intersystem crossing
(ISC) rates, and thus affect the outcome of cellular ROS product ratios.
To test the RPM hypothesis for ROS-related quantum biology, we developed low-frequency, low-field instru-
mentation for product-yield detected magnetic resonance (PYDMR)21. In the present PYDMR study, primary
human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to either 50 μ T static magnetic fields (SMF) in
control samples, or to 50 μ T SMFs combined with 1.4 MHz, 20 μ T RF magnetic fields at Zeeman resonance in
rms
experimental samples. The RF orientation was applied in parallel or perpendicular angles with respect to the SMF.
Intracellular O•− and extracellular HO were measured by selective assays in HUVEC cultures. Figure 2 exhibits
2 2 2
the changes observed in the ROS product distributions measured for parallel and perpendicular RF orientations.
In the perpendicular orientation, we measured a 36% ± 4 reduction of O•− (p < 0.002) and a 21% ± 5 reduction
2
of HO (p < 0.02). For the parallel orientation, we measured a 10% ± 2 (p < 0.002) reduction of O•− and an
2 2 2
8% ± 8 increase oaf HO (p < 0.02). Changes in ROS products in cell cultures between SMF ± RF are indica-
2 2
tive of a resonance effect on singlet-triplet intersystem crossing (or quantum coherences) at the point of ROS
formation21.
Singlet-triplet product yields were modeled by numerical simulations of a triplet-born one-proton radical-pair
reaction with static and RF magnetic fields at Zeeman resonance7, Fig. 3. The numerical results predict an
orientation-dependent increase in singlet product yield (HO) and decrease in triplet product yield (O•−) when
2 2 2
the resonant RF field is added to the static field. These simulations are in agreement with perpendicular experi-
mental results (Fig. 2) and are consistent with our previous cellular results with hyperfine resonance effects21. The
theoretical model of a one-proton RP does not account for changes in ROS yields (O•− and HO) in the parallel
2 2 2
orientation, which suggests either limitations of the simplified model in the complex cellular environment or
anisotropic hyperfine resonances near the Zeeman resonance.
To understand the potential effects of ROS signaling on cellular bioenergetics, we measured the oxygen con-
sumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) with a Seahorse XF Analyzer, Fig. 4. OCR indi-
cates the mitochondrial respiration rate and ECAR is predominately a measure of lactic acid formed during
glycolytic energy metabolism24,25. Figure 4 illustrates experiments in HUVECs that show RF orientation depend-
ence of OCR and ECAR bioenergetic measurements, which appear to result from changes in ROS partition-
ing. Zeeman resonance at perpendicular excitation did not affect OCR levels (Fig. 4A) but increased ECAR by

resonance (1.4 MHz and 50 μT magnetic field). The data is presented as a product yield ratio percentage

levels by 36% ± 4% (p < 0.002) and 21% ± 5% (p < 0.02), respectively, relative to controls. In parallel orientation,
HO levels increased by 8% ± 8% (p < 0.02), whereas O•− decreased by 10% ± 2% (p < 0.002), relative to
2 2 2
controls. The amount of ROS produced were normalized to protein concentrations and represent the average of
3 independent experiments.

one-proton radical-pair with one isotropic hyperfine coupling of 500 μ T and a RP lifetime of 10 μ s. The static
magnetic field was set to B = 50 μ T and the RF magnetic field amplitude set to B = 20 μ T (RMS), with a

100% ± 13 (Fig. 4C). Zeeman resonance at parallel excitation had an opposite effect, where OCR increased by
54% ± 4 (Fig. 4B) while ECAR remained unchanged (Fig. 4D). Altered OCR and ECAR values indicate pheno-
typic changes in HUVECs bioenergetic pathways, demonstrating spin biochemistry intervention of ROS signal-
ing by RF magnetic fields at Zeeman resonance.
The orientation effects that lead to specific ROS product distributions are in agreement with the simple RPM
model for the perpendicular orientation, which predicts an increase in singlet yields with a concomitant decrease
in triplet yields, Fig. 3. The overall reduction in measured ROS products at perpendicular excitation suggests
a possible ROS signaling link to increased glycolytic activity26,27. The decrease in steady-state ROS levels with
enhanced glycolytic activity might be due to scavenging of ROS by pyruvate28. The differential effect on ROS
product yields at parallel excitation indicate a signaling channel of increased mitochondrial respiration. Our
experiments did not explore the downstream targets of the ROS signaling pathways that lead to regulation of gly-
colysis and respiration. We suggest that ROS signaling channels are likely to involve the activation of bioenergetic
regulation proteins26,29,30, eliciting a type of hormesis response31 or a Warburg effect27.
Magnetic stimulation of ROS partitioning in live cells reveals hallmarks of quantum coherence, manifested
by changes in cellular ROS product distributions. Changes in ROS product partitioning, in turn, altered cellular
bioenergetics by increasing either mitochondrial respiration or glycolysis. ROS formation is inextricably linked
to bioenergetics by normal cellular metabolism, connecting persistent quantum effects in ROS oxidative signaling
to cellular bioenergetics. Because of the importance of ROS in human health and disease32, this research is likely
to have significance for several areas in bio-medical research. Our results provide fundamental insights into the
role of the RPM in ROS redox biology and cellular bioenergetics, revealing a new example of quantum biology.

Figure 4. Bioenergetic profiles of HUVECs cultures monitored with a Seahorse XF Analyzer, comparing
static alone ( ) and static + RF ( ) magnetic fields. Oligomycin was added at 21 min to inhibit ATP
synthesis, the proton ionophore FCCP was added at 41 min to assess the maximum possible oxygen
consumption, and antimycin A was added at 61 min to inhibit electron flow through complex III. The static
magnetic field was 50 μ T and the RF was 1.4 MHz at Zeeman resonance. The RF was oriented perpendicular
(A and C) or parallel (B and D) to the static field. Perpendicular RF excitation did not affect the oxygen
consumption rate (OCR) (Panel A), whereas extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) was increased by 100 ± 13
(p < 0.001, Panel C). Parallel RF excitation lead to increased OCR by 54 ± 4 (p < 0.001, Panel B), while ECAR
remained unchanged (Panel D). These are results of 3 independent representative experiments and data were
normalized to total cellular protein.
Methods
Cell Culture. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (passage 2–4) were cultured in endothe-
lial growth medium (Promocell GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum (FCS),
0.004 ml/ml endothelial cell growth supplement/heparin, 0.1 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 1 ng/ml basic
fibroblast growth factor, and 1 mg/ml hydrocortisone at 37 °C with 5% CO. The cells were cultured in a 75-cm2
2
flask to expand cell number. After reaching confluence, the cells were seeded in (a) 6-well culture plates at a
density of 3.5× 103 cells/cm2 for ROS experiments; (b) and in mini plates at 3,500 cells per well for Seahorse XFp
Analyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).
ROS Measurements. Cellular H O production was measured with the horseradish peroxidase-linked
2 2
Amplex Ultra Red (HRP-AUR) fluorometric assay (Invitrogen). After cells were seeded, they were exposed to
SMF ± RF magnetic fields for the duration of the experiment, by use of the PYDMR apparatus we previously
described21. At day 3, medium was aspirated and cells were washed with Hank’s Buffer (HB) with 100 μ M dieth-
ylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and incubated for 1 h with HB containing 10 μ M AUR and 0.2 units/
ml HRP. Resorufin fluorescence was collected on a Gemini fluorescence microplate reader (Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale, CA).
To measure intracellular production of O•−, HUVECs were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in HB containing
2
50 μM dihydroethidium (DHE) at day 3. Cells were washed twice in HB with 100 μM DTPA and harvested in 300
μ L of methanol. The samples were spun down for 15 min at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected and
dried for 5–6 hrs at 37 °C and stored at − 20 °C for 7–10 days before high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) analysis. An Agilent 1100 series HPLC with a G1321A fluorescence detector was used for DHE product

separation. Analytes were separated using a C-18 reverse-phase column (Nucleosil 250 to 4.5 mm) as previously
described33. The total fluorescence intensity of the 2-hydroxyethidium peak were averaged for all wells and then
averaged for three separate experiments.
Protein content, HPLC analysis, and resorufin fluorescence were measured at the same termination points.
HO and O•− measurements were normalized to total protein concentration (BCA, Pierce). HO calibration
2 2 2 2 2
curves with HRP-AUR under the same RF magnetic field strengths showed no differences compared to SMF
controls, demonstrating that RF fields do not interact with the HO detection assay.

Cellular Bioenergetics. An XFp Analyzer from Seahorse Bioscience was used for the bioenergetic meas-
urements. HUVECs were seeded at 4,000 cells per well in XFp miniplates and exposed to RF magnetic fields for
2 days. The MitoStress Test Assay was performed as described previously24,25. The XFp Analyzer measured mito-
chondrial respiration and glycolysis in vitro34,35 in the same samples. Mitochondrial respiration was determined
by the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in cell culture. Glycolysis was assessed by the extracellular acidification
rate (ECAR). To estimate the proportion of the OCR coupled to ATP synthesis, oligomycin (1 μg /ml) was injected
at 21 minutes into all samples to inhibit the ATP synthase. Typically, the OCR rate decreases in response to oli-
gomycin by the extent to which the cells are using mitochondria to generate ATP. The remaining OCR can be
ascribed to both proton leak across the mitochondrial membrane and oxygen consumption by processes other
than reduction at cytochrome c oxidase. To determine the maximal OCR that the cells can sustain, the pro-
ton ionophore (uncoupler) FCCP (1 μ M) was injected at 41 minutes. Lastly, antimycin A (10 μ M) is injected at
61 minutes to inhibit electron flux through Complex III, which suppresses OCR dramatically. What remains is the
OCR that is attributable to O consumption due to the formation of mitochondrial ROS and non-mitochondrial

sources.
