  "abstract": "Coherent Spin Dynamics of Radical Pairs in Weak Magnetic Fields\nHannah J. Hogben\nDepartment of Chemistry\nPhysical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory and Oriel College\nAbstract of a thesis submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy\nTrinity Term 2011\nThe outcome of chemical reactions proceeding via radical pair (RP) intermediates can be in-\nfluencedbythemagnitudeanddirectionofappliedmagneticfields,evenforinteractionstrengths\nfar smaller than the thermal energy. Sensitivity to Earth-strength magnetic fields has been sug-\ngested as a biophysical mechanism of animal magnetoreception and this thesis is concerned with\nsimulations of the effects of such weak magnetic fields on RP reaction yields.\nState-space restriction techniques previously used in the simulation of NMR spectra are\nhere applied to RPs. Methods for improving the efficiency of Liouville-space spin dynamics\ncalculations are presented along with a procedure to form operators directly into a reduced\nstate-space. These are ",
