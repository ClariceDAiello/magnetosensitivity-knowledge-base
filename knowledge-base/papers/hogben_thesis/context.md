## Abstract

Coherent Spin Dynamics of Radical Pairs in Weak Magnetic Fields

Abstract of a thesis submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy
Trinity Term 2011
The outcome of chemical reactions proceeding via radical pair (RP) intermediates can be in-
fluencedbythemagnitudeanddirectionofappliedmagneticfields,evenforinteractionstrengths
far smaller than the thermal energy. Sensitivity to Earth-strength magnetic fields has been sug-
gested as a biophysical mechanism of animal magnetoreception and this thesis is concerned with
simulations of the effects of such weak magnetic fields on RP reaction yields.
State-space restriction techniques previously used in the simulation of NMR spectra are
here applied to RPs. Methods for improving the efficiency of Liouville-space spin dynamics
calculations are presented along with a procedure to form operators directly into a reduced
state-space. These are
