  "abstract": "genetic information with the world of real living organisms?\nThe analysis of gene functions depends on two complementary approaches:\ngenetics and biochemistry. Genetics starts with the study of mutants: we either\nfind or make an organism in which a gene is altered, and then examine the effects\non the organism’s structure and performance (Figure 1–23). Biochemistry more\ndirectly examines the functions of molecules: here we extract molecules from an\norganism and then study their chemical activities. By combining genetics and\nbiochemistry, it is possible to find those molecules whose production depends on\na given gene. At the same time, careful studies of the performance of the mutant\norganism show us what role those molecules have in the operation of the organ-\nism as a whole. Thus, genetics and biochemistry used in combination with cell\nbiology provide the best way to relate genes and molecules to the structure and\nfunction of an organism.\n5 µm\nIn recent years, DNA sequence information ",
