A pulsed magnet which is useful for the research of chemical reactions has recently been constructed by our group.

X-band ESR apparatus has also been developed by our group. The world’s best sensitivity and resolution have been real-
ized in this apparatus. In this account, we review our recent results on new magnetic field effects and spin dynamics ob-
tained with such novel methods as described above for radical reactions at room temperature in solution. In Section 1,
typical mechanisms of MFEs on radical pairs such as the ∆g mechanism and the relaxation mechanism are explained as
the introduction of this review. In Section 2, the saturation of MFEs due to the ∆g mechanism observed for radical pairs
generated from the photoreduction of 4-methoxybenzophenone with benzenethiol in fluid solutions under ultrahigh fields
are described. In Section 3, the saturation and reversion of MFEs due to the relaxation mechanism observed for radical
pairs generated from the photoreduction of carbonyl and quinone compounds in micellar solutions under ultrahigh fields
are reviewed. In Section 4, the first observation of MFEs on the reactions of three-spin systems generated photochemi-
cally in solution are introduced. In Section 5, we describe spin dynamics of radical pairs studied with our optically de-
tected ESR apparatus for radical pairs generated from the photoreduction of carbonyl and quinone compounds in micel-
lar solutions.

5. Spin Dynamics of Radical Pairs Studied with an Opti-
tween the quartet-doublet states plays an important role during
cally Detected ESR Apparatus
In the preceding sections, the studies of MFEs on radical re-
actions with the transient optical absorption (A(t) profiles) due
to intermediate radicals were reviewed. Direct measurements
of intermediate radicals with various ESR methods are also
possible. For example, we first studied the radical pairs in mi-
celles with a continuous wave (cw) ESR method without field
modulation and found CIDEP signals due to spin-correlated
radical pairs.25 The cw-ESR method without field modulation
is informative, but its time resolution is not always high
enough to clarify the details of spin dynamics. Although
pulsed-ESR methods such as the Fourier transfer (FT) ESR
can improve the time resolution, they have many limitations in
measuring spin dynamics. For example, such ESR methods
can provide us only the combined information of concentration
and polarization. Thus, an optical detected (OD) ESR method
which is realized by the coupling of the pulsed-ESR and tran-
sient absorption methods seems to be advantageous to the
study of dynamic behavior of intermediate radicals.
Recently, we constructed such an ODESR apparatus, com-
bining a JEOL RSV 2000 X-band pulsed-ESR one with our ns-
transient optical absorption one.26 Because we could realize
the world best sensitivity in our ODESR apparatus, we have
been able to obtain novel fruits on spin dynamics of radical
pairs with a short microwave pulse. In this section, several
typical results obtained with our ODESR for the photoreduc-

disappearance from its mixed M state (k (cid:3) k ), the initial

part of the rise corresponds to the generation process with the
rate constant of k
G
. During this stage, the [M]/[T(cid:6)] ratio is kept
approximately constant. When the generation of the radical
pairs is slowed down due to the consumption of the triplet
state, the [M]/[T(cid:6)] ratio is decreased by the cage recombina-
tion from the M state. On the other hand, the decay from the
T(cid:6) state is much slower than that of the M one. Because the
[M]/[T(cid:6)] ratio becomes zero at the maximum point (t (cid:2) t
M2
),
the decay part of the [a(cid:4)b](t (cid:2) t ) curve corresponds to the

decay of [T(cid:6)]. From its decay, therefore, the k

be obtained. This method for the determination of the k value

is much better than that from the a(cid:4)b curve mentioned before

Hisaharu Hayashi was born in Tokushima in 1942. He has been the Director of Molecular
Photochemistry Labotatory at RIKEN (The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research)
since 1983. He graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1964 and received his Dr. Sc. un-
der the auspices of Prof. Saburo Nagakura at The Institute for Solid State Physics of the Uni-
versity of Tokyo in 1969. Since 1969, he has been working in RIKEN. He was appointed as
a visiting professor at the Institute for Molecular Science for two years (1984/1986). He has
been a visiting professor at Department of Electronic Chemistry of Interdisciplinary Gradu-
ate School of Science and Engineering of Tokyo Institute of Technology since 1997. His re-
search interests are in Spin Chemistry, including magnetic field effects on chemical reac-
tions. In 1998, he edited a book entitled “Dynamic Spin Chemistry” with Prof. Saburo
Nagakura and Prof. Tohru Azumi. He received the Award of Chemical Society of Japan for
Young Scientists in 1976 and the Award of Japanese Photochemistry Association in 1992.
Yoshio Sakaguchi was born in Tokyo in 1954. He has been a member of Molecular Photo-
chemistry Laboratory at RIKEN (The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research) since
1983 and has been promoted to its Senior Scientist in 1991. He was graduated from the Uni-
versity of Tokyo in 1976 and received his Dr. Sc. under the auspices of Prof. Saburo
Nagakura at the Institute for Solid State Physics of the University of Tokyo in 1981. He had
been a visiting associate professor at the Department of Material Science of Graduate
School of Science and Engineering of Saitama University since 1993 and has been promoted
to a visiting professor since 1999. His research interests are in Spin Chemistry, including
magnetic field and microwave field effects on chemical reactions.
Masanobu Wakasa was born in Tokyo in 1961. He graduated from Gakushuin University in
1985 and received his Dr. Sc. from Gakushuin University (Prof. K. Mochida) in 1989. He
was given the Research Fellowship for Young Scientists from Japan Society for the Promo-
tion of Science (1988/1989). He has been a member of Molecular Photochemistry Labora-
tory at RIKEN (The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research) since 1989 and has been
promoted to its Senior Research Scientist since 1999. His research interests are in photo-
chemistry and organometallic chemistry. In 1991, he received the Award for Young Chem-
ists from the Silicon Photochemistry Society of Japan.
