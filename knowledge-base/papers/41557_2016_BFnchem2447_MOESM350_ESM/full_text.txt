A. Measurement of magnetic field effects by fluorescence
Spectrally resolved MFEs: Setup I
Magnetic field effects on fluorescence spectra were recorded essentially as described by Evans et
al.1 Samples were positioned between Helmholtz coils which were used to generate static magnetic
fields of up to 12 mT, with rise and fall times less than 3 ms. A 405 nm CW diode laser (1Q1H350,
350 mW; Power Technology) provided continuous illumination of the sample. The fluorescence was
coupled to a spectrograph (SR303i; Andor) which dispersed the wavelength components onto a
charge‐coupled device (CCD) camera (DU90P‐BV; Andor Newton). The fluorescence signal was
integrated for a defined period (the camera 'exposure time') starting at a fixed 'delay time', T, after
switching on the magnetic field. After recording the signal, the field was returned to zero ready for
the next measurement. Most solutions were flowed at a rate of ca. 0.25 mL min−1 through a sample
cell (Starna Scientific, UV Quartz, 45/Q, 1 mm optical path length) so as to minimize
photodegradation. Most of the experiments were conducted at room temperature and for magnetic
fields in the range 0 to 12 mT, chosen in a randomized order. For AtCry1, the sample was not flowed
and was cooled (282 K) using a custom‐made, chilled stage.
Experimental parameters for the results presented in the main text are given in Supplementary
Table A1.

Time‐resolved MFEs: Setup II
Time‐resolved measurements were carried out using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Ti‐E;
Nikon). Samples were held in a flow chamber constructed from a silicon rubber gasket (McMaster‐
Carr) and two coverslips (Menzel; Germany) with an optical path length of 0.5 mm (see Ref.2). They
were illuminated using the attenuated and expanded beam of a 470 nm diode laser (Stradus 473‐80,
80 mW; Vortran Laser Technology). The excitation light was focused at the back aperture of an oil
immersion objective (CFI Apo TIRF 60X Oil, N.A. 1.49; Nikon) to provide trans‐illumination of the sample.
The power entering the back of the objective was varied between 0.10 and 3.7 mW resulting in
power densities in the object plane between 0.020 and 0.74 μW μm−2 (based on the 1/e2 contours of
the excitation intensity). The fluorescence emission was collected through the same objective,

transmitted through a dichroic mirror (Brightline FF497‐Di03; Semrock) and a bandpass filter
(BrightLine 550/88; Semrock), and recorded using an electron‐multiplying CCD camera (iXon+
DV860E; Andor Technology). Magnetic fields were generated using a solenoid wound around a 3 mm
diameter ferrite core and fixed into a non‐metallic mount placed 1 mm above the sample. Using a
custom‐built power supply, magnetic fields of up to 27 mT could be generated with a rise time of
less than 70 μs. Both the data acquisition and the magnetic field stepping were controlled by a
digital delay pulse generator (model 9520; Quantum Composers). The excitation light was only
admitted to the sample during the fluorescence measurement period using an optical shutter (SH05;
Thorlabs) synchronized with the camera shutter. A description of the calibration of the magnetic
field can be found in Ref.3.
Experimental parameters for the results presented in the main text are given in Supplementary
Table A2.
For all samples except cryptochrome (Fig. 6, main text), the fluorescence was integrated for a period
of 5 ms per camera frame (the camera 'exposure time') and the interval between frames was 7 ms
(frame rate: ~143 Hz). Typically 16,000 frames were recorded with the magnetic field alternated
between zero and a preset value every 80, 160, or 240 frames depending on the sample (see
Supplementary Table A2 for details of individual measurements). The 'field on/off interval' is the
time the magnetic field remains on or off before switching. For each run, a previously unexposed
aliquot of the sample was admitted to the cell using a flow system. The flow was stopped while the
fluorescence was measured.
For the cryptochrome experiments, 50 μL samples were held between two coverslips separated by a
polydimethylsiloxane spacer (Sylgard 184; Dow Corning). The sample was injected into the pre‐
cooled cell placed on a Peltier stage (PT100‐NIF; Linkam) at 268 K. 10,000 frames were recorded with
an exposure time of 40 ms and frame interval of 42 ms with the field switched every 100 frames (i.e.
4.2 s). For each measurement at least 11 time‐traces were accumulated, each time using a
previously unexposed portion of the sample.

The fluorescence intensity for each camera frame was obtained by 'robust averaging'.4 To determine
the time‐resolved MFE, the fluorescence time‐profiles from individual measurements (as described
above) were averaged, fitted to a multi‐exponential function and used to calculate the MFEs for
each field‐on/field‐off cycle. The first 5 cycles were discarded because of distortions resulting from

the system adjusting to a new quasi‐equilibrium during the initial phase of photoexcitation and
because there was some difficulty fitting the average intensity due to the steep decay of the
fluorescence at the beginning of the measurement. The time‐resolved MFEs for the remaining
on/off‐cycles were averaged with the smallest and largest 5% of the values at every time point
removed in order to guard against outliers and spikes. There were no statistically significant
differences (at the 95% level) between the remaining time points and their means. In order to
determine the prompt and the delayed MFEs, the time‐resolved MFEs were fitted to exponential
functions starting with the fourth time point. The MFEs extrapolated to t = 0 and t   are reported
as χ and χ , respectively.

B. Measurement of magnetic field effects on intermolecular
reactions of flavins
FMN/Lysozyme
Using setup I, fluorescence‐detected MFE profiles were recorded for FMN/lysozyme mixtures at
various delay times, T, between switching on the magnetic field and recording the fluorescence. A
10 µM FMN/0.5 mM lysozyme sample was flowed at 0.25 mL min1 with continuous photoexcitation
by a 405 nm laser at 270 mW. The fluorescence spectral profile showed good agreement with the
S  S , * transition of the isoalloxazine group of the flavin. A small decrease in fluorescence
1 0
intensity was seen on application of an external magnetic field (12 mT). The inverted, scaled
fluorescence difference signal for T = 0.01 s, ΔI (B ) = I (B ) − I (0), is shown as the black trace in
F 0 F 0 F
Supplementary Fig. B1a; its sign is consistent with an initial triplet radical pair. The difference
spectrum coincides perfectly with the fluorescence profile of fully oxidised FMN (red trace),
suggesting a single dominant, magnetically sensitive fluorescent species (the excited singlet state of
fully oxidised FMN). This conclusion is reinforced by the coincidence of the scaled difference signals
obtained for different delay times between the field change and the start of fluorescence acquisition
(Supplementary Fig. B1b).

maximum MFE) is unchanged (Supplementary Table B1). The invariance of B is in keeping with our

proposal that the enhanced MFEs stem from a single radical pair.

Setup II was used to investigate the time‐dependence of the enhanced MFE. Fresh samples were
continuously illuminated in the presence of a magnetic field stepped between 0 mT and 27 mT (rise
time < 70 μs) recording the fluorescence continuously. The overall decrease in fluorescence intensity
(Fig. 2a and d, main text) is due to the sample re‐equilibrating to photoexcitation and the interplay
between photobleaching and diffusion. Turning on the photoexcitation source rapidly depletes the
flavin ground state as steady state concentrations for the excited states are reached. The
photochemistry of flavins is not as perfectly cyclic as implied by the reaction scheme in Fig. 1 (main
text). Photoexcitation also leads to degradation products such as lumichrome.5 Although
lumichrome is also capable of forming photo‐induced triplet‐born radical pairs, no magnetically
sensitive fluorescence from lumichrome was observable with 470 nm photoexcitation in setup II.
Such photodegradation pathways tend to reduce the measured fluorescence intensity, although this
is opposed by diffusion of fresh sample into the detection volume.
As mentioned in the main text, the time‐resolved MFE is superimposed on the decaying trend of the
fluorescence. An average MFE response to field switching was obtained following the subtraction of
the decay by means of multi‐exponential fits. No statistically significant difference was observed
when comparing individual cycles to their means. Furthermore, the averaged MFE responses to
field‐on and field‐off steps were identical (see Supplementary Fig. B2).

switching field on. Blue: response to switching field off. Red: average of the two. Black:

To obtain the enhancement factor, E, the initial (primary, χ ) and final (delayed, χ ) MFEs were
p d
determined. An exponential function was fitted to the slow component (see, e.g., Supplementary
Fig. B2) to obtain a time constant (τ). Using such fits values of χ could be obtained for reactions that
d
did not reach a steady state during the field on/off periods.

Increasing the solvent viscosity of the FMN/lysozyme solutions by the addition of glycerol (20% v/v)
was found to boost the enhancement (Supplementary Fig. B3) from 2.32 to 3.50, as well as
increasing the time constant from τ = 0.47 s to τ = 2.2 s. While the ratio of the two termination rate
constants (k /k ) determines E, it is their values which set the timescale. It seems likely that the

increase in solvent viscosity affects the diffusion‐controlled contributions to k and k and hence

both E and τ.

FMN/Tryptophan
The rate of disappearance of flavin radicals by disproportionation and reaction with molecular
oxygen increases supra‐linearly with their concentration as a result of the quadratic and
autocatalytic nature, respectively, of the two processes. As expected and shown in Supplementary
Figs B4 and B5, increasing either the FMN concentration or the laser pump power increases k ,
F
decreases k /k and results in smaller enhancement factors.

C. Calculation of MFEs for inter‐ and intramolecular radical pairs
Intermolecular MFEs
The reaction scheme in Supplementary Fig. C1 has been used to model the MFEs that arise in cyclic
intermolecular radical pair reactions under conditions of continuous illumination and square‐wave
modulated magnetic fields. Using an approach analogous to that of Murakami et al.6, we have solved
numerically the differential equations that describe the time‐dependence of the system following
step‐wise changes in the intensity of an external magnetic field.
Supplementary Figure C1. Reaction scheme for intermolecular flavin (F) +
donor (D) reactions.
The magnetic sensitivity of the photocycle originates in field‐dependent singlet‐triplet
interconversion of the singlet (S) and triplet (T , T , T ) spin states of the geminate radical pair (curly

MATLAB’s 15s ordinary differential equation solver was used to calculate the change in the

termination reactions play a role, their impact on the operation of cryptochrome as a magnetic

Furthermore, when the light intensity is reduced (Supplementary Fig. C8), a larger ratio k / k is

necessary to achieve a significant enhancement (see Supplementary Information). That is, the lower

D. Bare‐bones model of MFEs for inter‐ and intramolecular radical
pairs
The kinetic model described above, while comprehensive, does not readily reveal the essential
principles underlying the enhanced MFE. Here we present an approximate, pared down model that
shows the same qualitative behaviour and affords a simple expression relating the amplification
factor, E, to relevant rate constants.

A simplified intermolecular radical pair reaction scheme is shown in Supplementary Fig. D1a. It
comprises the diamagnetic, ground‐state flavin (F), uncorrelated free radicals (F and D+), and a
magnetically sensitive intermediate (G), which accounts for the radical pair and all upstream, excited
states. Magnetic field effects are introduced by allowing the rate constant with which G returns to F,
k (B ), i.e. the recombination efficiency, to depend on the strength of the external magnetic field, B .

The MFE is defined as the relative change in the steady‐state concentration of F brought about by
the action of the magnetic field. Since the MFEs, χ (i = d, p), are typically small, it is permissible to

Intramolecular MFEs
Amplified MFEs can also occur for radical pairs formed intramolecularly in a photocycle in which
there are no bimolecular recombination reactions. A bare‐bones reaction scheme that qualitatively
accounts for MFEs in this case is shown in Supplementary Fig. D2a. Proceeding in a manner
analogous to that for the intermolecular case, we find that the MFE enhancement for the ground‐
state (FD) is given by
f2 f 1
E (11)
f2 f 
where k /k k (B ). Note that when k = k = 0, the MFE is  k /k . For an experiment
P P B 0 F D p B B
that detects the fluorescence of the electron acceptor, F (see Supplementary Fig. D2a), Equation (11)
is applicable when the photoexcited state of F is swiftly quenched in the state F–D(cid:127)+, e.g. by energy
transfer. Note that 1 so that an enhancement of the MFE (E ≥ 1) is expected irrespective of the
value of f = k /k . This is strikingly different to the intermolecular case above.
D A
If the populations of both F–D(cid:127)+ and F–D are monitored via the fluorescence of F, the enhancement
factor is given by:
f2 f 1 1
E   (12)
f2 f  f(1)
and significant MFE enhancement results for f > 1. If the fluorescence quantum yield is reduced by
the presence of D(cid:127)+, Eqs. (12) and (11) provide lower and upper bounds on E. Supplementary Fig.
D2b illustrates the dependence of E on f in these two limits.

E. Flavin photochemistry
Transient absorption
Transient absorption spectra for the FMN/lysozyme and FMN/Trp reactions were obtained using a
Sirah Cobra Dye laser (450 nm, 3 mJ, 7 ns pulses) pumped by a Nd:YAG Continuum Surelite laser (355
nm, 100 mJ, 7 ns pulses). An Oriel xenon arc lamp (800 W) provided the continuous UV‐visible probe
light. The probe light transmitted through the sample cell was passed to an Oriel monochromator to
select a specific wavelength and then detected by a photo‐multiplier tube. The time‐resolved
absorption profile, ΔA(t), was recorded as the difference in the absorption of the sample before and
after photoexcitation, as a function of time after the pump pulse.
The transient absorption spectra for FMN/lysozyme and FMN/Trp (Supplementary Fig. E1) show that
the flavin triplet excited state, 3FMN*, and the neutral flavin semiquinone radical, FMNH, decay on
the order of microseconds and seconds respectively, in agreement with prior studies.10, 11 A Stern‐
Volmer plot for 3FMN* gave a 3FMN*Trp quenching rate constant of 1.2 × 109 M−1s−1 close to the
diffusion controlled limit.

Reactivity of flavin radicals
A significant reaction pathway for the neutral flavin semiquinone radical is the thermodynamically
favourable disproportionation reaction to form the fully oxidized and fully reduced forms of the
flavin:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

Furthermore, there is a slow reaction pathway for the neutral semiquinone radical reacting with
molecular oxygen12, 13with a rate constant k ≈ 1 × 104 M−1 s−1:
O2
FH·+ O  F + O·-+ H+ . (15)
2 2
However, oxidation of FH· radicals by the superoxide (O·- ) formed in (15),
2
FH·+ O·-+H+  F + H O , (16)
2 2 2
occurs much more rapidly (k ≈ 1 × 108 M−1 s−1), meaning that the two reactions together are
O
2

autocatalytic.13
The disproportionation and molecular oxygen reactions are obvious candidates for MFE‐enhancing
termination processes in intermolecular photocycles. Both reactions proceed with a supra‐linear
dependence on the concentration of flavin radicals resulting in a reduction in k /k , and hence also in
D F
E, when either the flavin concentration or the pump power is increased (see above and main text).
Furthermore, the rate of reaction of flavin radicals with molecular oxygen is strongly dependent on
their protonation state (pK (FMNH) = 8.6) and therefore on the pH. The equivalent reaction to (15)
a
for FMN has a rate constant, k ≈ 1 × 108 M−1 s−1, that is four orders of magnitude faster than for
O2
FMNH.12, 13 This allows E to be controlled by changing the pH of the solution.
To confirm the involvement of molecular oxygen, experiments were performed on de‐oxygenated
aqueous solutions of FMN (10 M) and tryptophan (1.0 mM) prepared in a glove box under an argon
atmosphere (Supplementary Fig. E2). Consistent with the above interpretation, we found an
increased amplification factor (E) in the absence of oxygen because of the reduced rate of removal
of flavin radicals (k ). The absolute amplitude of the prompt magnetic field effect is also slightly
F
higher, probably due to a longer radical pair lifetime. De‐oxygenation has an impact at several points
in the photocycle (unlike, for example, adding TCEP whose only significant effect is to accelerate the
reduction of the donor radical). In the absence of oxygen, flavin triplets accumulate leading to
triplet‐triplet annihilation (T + T  S + S ) and delayed fluorescence (S  S + h) which
1 1 1 0 1 0 F
complicates matters considerably. Additionally, in the absence of oxygen, the flavin radicals are very
long lived meaning that there is a much greater depletion of the ground state reactants and
consequently weak fluorescence from the desired route (S + h  S ; S  S + h). In short, the
0 1 1 0 F
presence of oxygen is desirable in the sense that it “closes” the photocycle and gives favourable
cycle times.

F. Switched light intensity
Corroboration of our interpretation of the MFE amplification effect was obtained from experiments
in which the light intensity was periodically adjusted (in the absence of a magnetic field) as an
alternative way of shifting the position of the photo‐stationary state (Supplementary Fig. F1a).
Attenuation of the light intensity was achieved by square‐wave, on‐off modulation of the 350 mW
laser output varying the duty cycle to obtain the reduced intensities (80%, 70%, 60%, 50% and 20%)
shown in the figure. When the light intensity was abruptly reduced, a prompt fluorescence
component was observed followed by a slow delayed component. This is reproduced by simulations
(Supplementary Fig. F1b) with the same parameter values used previously (Supplementary Table
C1).
