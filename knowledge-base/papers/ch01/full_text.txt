Such basic knowledge is also necessary in understanding the use of magnetic
resonance techniques (Chapter 5). In the following sections we discuss a few
fundamental principles of the physical processes that govern the interaction of
light with biomolecules, optical markers or other relevant matter such as nano-
particles. This chapter provides a brief but wide-ranging insight into important

The size of typical molecules or biomolecules is usually on the order of a few
nanometres, which is far smaller than the dimensions of the oscillating electric-
fieldwavesofvisiblelight,whichareontheorderofafewhundrednanometres.
When molecules are within the waves of the light, the charged components of
the molecules, especially the electrons, are affected by the oscillating electric-
field component of the light. If a molecule possesses a suitable electronic struc-
ture it can absorb a photon of a specific wavelength, resulting in an electronic
structure rearrangement. In the next section, we discuss what the electronic
structureofmoleculeslookslike.

WhatDoestheElectronicStructureofMoleculesLookLike?Orbitals,WaveFunctions
andBondingInteractions
As with photons, electrons posses also both wave- and particle-like properties.
Because of the wave-like character of electrons, only probabilities can be given
offindingelectronsatacertainplacearoundthenucleiofamolecule.Thiselec-
tronic structure is usually visualized by electron clouds or probability densities,
which are mathematically described by three-dimensional probability density
functions.Dependingonthemolecularstructure,onlydistincteigenstatesofthe
electron probability densitiesare possible. Such a state simply describes a possi-
blethree-dimensionalstandingwaveofthenegativelychargedelectronwavesin
the presence of the positively charged nuclei – similar to a string of an instru-
ment, which can also vibrate only with certain frequencies and overtones. Each

usually transferred from an electronic ground state into an energetically higher
electronic excited state. In an excited state the three-dimensional, electronic
probability densities are different from the ground-state probability densities.
Only photons having energies corresponding to the energy difference between
these electronic states can be absorbed by the molecules. This is the origin of
the colour of a compound: only light of certain wavelengths is absorbed by the
compound – light of other wavelengths is either transmitted or scattered. The
photon energy corresponding to the absorbed wavelength is equal to the neces-
saryexcitationenergyfortherespectivetransition.
What does the probability density function, P(x, y, z), corresponding to a cer-
tain electronic state look like? In quantum theory, the probability density for
finding electrons at a certain place P(x, y, z) is calculated from the electronic
wavefunction,ψ(x,y,z),correspondingtothisstate:
P x;y;zψ* x;y;zψ x;y;z (1.2)

and negative parts of the three-dimensional wave function changes with a cer-
tainfrequency.Thenegativeandpositivesignsoftheorbitalsarenottobecon-
fused with negative or positive charges. They are rather a consequence of the
wave character of the electrons. For example, the waves of light (Figure 1.1) are
also mathematically described by oscillating functions having negative and posi-
tivevaluesbutofcoursethishasnothingtodowithpositiveornegativecharges.
However, often, it is sufficient to work with time-independent versions of the
wavefunctions,whichrepresentstationarystatesorstandingwavesandinwhich
the oscillating, time-dependent factor is omitted. In Figure 1.3, for example,
time-independent wave functions or orbitals are visualized for which negative
partsaredepictedingrey,whereasthepositivepartsareunfilled.Theoscillation
also has no effect on the probability density of finding an electron at certain
places, P ~r, negative signs are cancelled out by the multiplication described by
(1.2). The shape of the three-dimensional probability densities, P ~r, as calcu-
lated by (1.2) are visually often quite similar to the shape of the wave functions,
with the most important difference that there are no “negative” regions for the
probabilitydensityofelectrons.
Orbitals,andthusprobabilitydensities,neverchangeabruptly.Foranelectron
in an s orbital, for example, the corresponding probability density increases
smoothly when approaching the nucleus. Presentations of orbitals, such as
shown in Figure 1.3, or probability densities usually symbolize a certain volume
ofthe correspondingprobability densityin which theelectron can befound, for
example, with 90% probability. The shown surfaces are called isosurfaces
because they correspond to equal values for the probability of finding the elec-
tronortoequalabsolutevaluesofthewavefunction.
To contain all information on the electrons, for example the actual phase of
the oscillation, wave functions can also contain mathematically complex terms.
The symbol “*” in (1.2) simply denotes a transformation in which all imaginary
parts of complex numbers in the wave function are multiplied by  1. However,
for a qualitative understanding of the following sections, an indepth knowledge
abouttheimaginarypartsofthewavefunctionsisnotmandatory.
Ifanatomapproachesanotheratomthisaffectsthepossibleeigenstatesofthe
electrons because they are then in the vicinity of two positively charged nuclei.
Thepossiblewavefunctionsforsingleelectronsinthepresenceofseveralnuclei
are called molecular orbitals. Molecular orbitals can be approximated by linear
combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO). If the wave functions of two atomic s
orbitals with the same sign (corresponding to the situation that they oscillate in
phase) are combined they form a new a bonding molecular orbital called a
σ-orbital, (φ σ ∝φ1 s φ2 s , in the lower middle of Figure 1.3). The energy of an
electron occupying a bonding molecular σ orbital is lower than that of an elec-
tron in an atomic s orbital. This is the driving force for molecular bonds. So, if,
forexample,twohydrogenatomswithasingleelectroninansorbitalapproach,
both electrons can then be found in the newly formed bonding σ-orbital. The
probability density of finding the electrons at a certain place of the molecular
σ-orbital can again be calculated from the corresponding molecular orbital φ σ

using(1.2).Notably,anorbitalcanonlybeoccupiedbyamaximumoftwoelec-
tronswithoppositespins(Wewilldiscussthemeaningofelectronspinsfurther
below.) If two atomic s-orbitals with opposite signs (corresponding to the situa-
tion that they oscillate out of phase) are combined they form an antibonding
molecularσ*-orbital,φ σ ∝φ1 s  φ2 s (in the uppermiddle ofFigure 1.3).Electrons
in antibonding σ*-orbitals havehigherenergiesthan electrons in bonding σ-orbi-
tals (orbital energies are visualized as horizontal lines on the right in Figure 1.3,
the corresponding electrons with opposite spins as arrows on these lines). By
absorbing a photon with an energy corresponding to the energy difference
betweentheseorbitalsoneoftheelectronsinthebondingσ-orbitalcanbeexcited
into the antibonding σ* orbital. The large energy gap of the σ®σ* transition
usuallyrequiresexcitationwithphotonscorrespondingtoUVlight.Theantibond-
ing σ*-orbital has one nodal plane, which constitutes a region of zero electron
density.Therefore,aσ®σ* excitationcan leadtobondbreakage.Notably,itisa
convention to assign antibonding orbitals also by a star, which is not to be con-
fusedwith the meaning of the star in equations such as (1.2) where itassigns the
earliermentionedtransformationofimaginarypartsofthewavefunctions.
Thesecondsimplestatomicorbitalsarep-orbitals(left-handsideinFigure1.4).
They have a nodal plane at the nucleus andthe sign of the real part of the wave
function is always opposite across this nodal plane. Two atomic p-orbitals of
appropriate relative orientation at neighbouring nuclei can form molecular
π-orbitals.2) In organic molecules and biomolecules most π-orbitals are found at

Similarly, several p-orbitals can form π-orbitals that are delocalized over mul-
tiplenuclei(Figure1.5).Suchmolecularorbitalsarecalledconjugatedπ-systems.
In Figure 1.5, four atomic p-orbitals form four molecular orbitals. In a similar
manner, n molecular π-orbitals can be constructed from n atomic p-orbitals.
The energy of the newly formed molecular orbitals increases with the number
nodal planes (see energies of the molecular π-orbitals π , π , π*;π* in Figure 1.5).

The electrons from the original atomic p-orbitals (four in Figure 1.5) are then
filled into molecularorbitals, starting with the lowest-energyorbitalsand obeying
therule thatonly amaximum oftwo electronsareallowedpermolecularorbital.
If orbitals have equal energies, they are first occupied by single electrons before
anyofthemisfilledwithasecondelectron.
The highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital are usually assigned by their acronyms HOMO and LUMO, respectively.
For most organic molecules, the electronic ground state corresponds to the situa-
tionthatallorbitalsuptotheHOMOelectronsareoccupiedbytwoelectrons(see,
for example, Figures 1.4 and 1.5). Similarly, for organic molecules the first excited
statecorrespondsoftentothesituationthatoneelectronhasbeenpromotedfrom

For butadiene (Figure 1.5), for example, S corresponds to the situation in

which the lowest two molecular orbitals π and π are each occupied by two

electrons. As can be seen by a comparison of the orbital energies of ethene in
Figure 1.4 and the corresponding orbital energies of butadiene in Figure 1.5 the
energydifferencebetweentheelectronsintheHOMOandtheLUMOdecreases
as the system of conjugated p-orbitals becomes larger. In general, larger conju-
gatedπ-systemstypically absorb photonsoflower energyandthus longerwave-
lengthsthansmallerconjugatedπ-systems[comparewith(1.1)].
Themolecularπ-orbitalsofmorecomplicatedmolecules,likebiomoleculesor
optical markers, naturally look more complicated. Figure 1.6 shows wave func-
tions of the π-system of the organic molecule anthracene as an example. The
general rule that electrons in orbitals having more nodal planes have higher
energiesstillappliesinmostcases.
Electronic transitions involving conjugated π-systems are especially important
inthespectroscopy ofbiomolecules, oropticalmarkers,becauseabsorptionand

Theprobabilitybywhichaphotonofcorrectenergyisabsorbedbyamolecule
depends on the ability of the light’s oscillating electric field to change the initial
electronic state into the final electronic state. For example, light can excite the
single electron of an isolated hydrogen atom from an s-orbital into a p-orbital,
whentheorientationofitsoscillationelectricfieldvectorisperpendiculartothe
nodalplane ofthep-orbital (Figure1.7a). Inturn,itisnot possibletoexcite the
electron from one s-orbital into another s-orbital of higher energy because such
atransitioncannotbepromotedbyanoscillatingelectricfield(Figure1.7b).
As can be seen from this simple example, it is important that the direction of
the oscillation of the electric field of the light fits somehow with the orientation
andshapeoftheelectroncloudsandthewavefunctionsdescribingtheinitialand
the final electronicstate ofthe atomormolecule. The directionofthe oscillating
electric field of the light is defined by its polarization vector (Figure 1.1). The
directionandmagnitudeofthechangeinthechargedistributionduringthetran-
sition is closely related to the so-called transition dipole moment, which can be
calculatedfromthewavefunctionsoftheinitialandfinalelectronicstate(1.4):

dipole moment for the corresponding transition (Figure 1.9). Since the wave func-
tions oscillate, the signs of the orbitals in Figure 1.8 are arbitrary. As a result, it is
also arbitrary whether the transition dipole moment vector points in one or the
otherdirection(indicatedbythedoublearrowinFigures1.8and1.9).

Also, the probability of the reverse process, the transition of an electron from

transition. A transition thus corresponds to the case where the oscillating
electric-field component of light is in resonance with the corresponding transi-
tiondensityoscillationbetweeninitialandfinalstates.
Acalculationofthetransitiondensityandthetransitiondipolemomentbetween
the two s-orbitals (Figure 1.7b) explains why this transition cannot be induced by
light. The corresponding transition density is spherically symmetrical around the
spherically symmetrical origin at the nucleus (position of the nucleus is at x=0,
y=0, z=0). Since the term e~r in (1.4) switches signs at the origin (x=0, y=0,
z=0),intheoverallintegrationdifferentpartsaroundtheorigincanceleachother
out exactly. For example, at the arbitrary position (x=l, y=0, z=0) the value of
the transition density, ψ*ψ , is exactly the same as at the position (x= l, y=0,
F I
z=0). The term e~r also has the same absolute value at these two positions but
oppositesigns[rememberthat~r  x;y;z].Consequently,ψ*ψ  e~r atthesetwo

positionsalsohavethe sameabsolutevaluesbutoppositesignsandthereforecan-
cel each other out exactly in the integration described by (1.4). The same applies
foranyothertwopositions(x,y,z)and( x, y, z).Asanoverallresultthetran-
sition dipole moment is zero. In general, transitions are called optically forbidden
ordipoleforbiddenwhentheyhaveazerotransitiondipolemoment.
Some important selection rules for optical transitions can be deduced directly
from the above argument. For instance, the parity selection rule, also called
Laporte’s rule, that applies for molecules having an inversion symmetry centre.
Molecules having an inversion symmetry centre always have identical atoms at
the positions (x, y, z) and ( x,  y,  z). The centre itself is located in the middle
of the molecules and has the coordinates x=0, y=0, z=0. This is the case for
ethene (Figure 1.4), butadiene (Figure 1.5) and also for anthracene (Figure 1.6).
Thecorrespondingmolecularorbitalsofthesemoleculescaneitherhaveag(ger-
ade) or a u (ungerade) symmetry. For orbitals with g symmetry the wave func-
tions have identical values for any pair of positions (x, y, z) and ( x,  y,  z).

Why is the probability for a pure electronic excitation (v´´=0®v´=0)4) for
some molecules (Figures 1.10a and c) the highest, whereas for other molecules
(Figure 1.10b and d) an excitation into the third vibrational state of S (v´´=0®

called Franck–Condon principle. Since the timescale of excitation of the light
electrons into a higherelectronic state isfar shorterthanthe vibrational motions

because excited states usually have more antibonding character (Figures 1.3–1.5)

not exactly overlapping, because typically the molecule itself and solvent molecules
around the solute molecule rearrange themselves as a response to the new elec-

For the third possible de-excitation path way we have to introduce a further

depicted by opposite arrows in Figure 1.14. The quantum mechanical Pauli rule
states that no electron in a molecule can have the exact same properties as
another electron in the molecule. Therefore, an orbital can be occupied by two
electronsonlyiftheyhavedifferentspins.
However, as can be seen from the right most diagram in Figure 1.14, Pauli’s
ruleisnotviolatedifasingleelectronexcitedintoahighermolecularorbitalhas
the same spin as the remaining electron in the original HOMO, because they
occupy different orbitals. Such electronic states with two unpaired electrons of
the same spin are referred to as triplet states. The energetically lowest triplet
stateisusuallydepictedbyT .Statesinwhichforeachelectronanotherelectron

The vector diagrams depicted in Figure 1.15 give us an idea of the origin of
this nomenclature. The spin of an electron is a purely quantum mechanical
property and has no classical analogue. However, due to the spin, the electron
hasasmallmagneticmoment,withtheresultthatanisolatedelectronactssimi-
larly to a small magnet. In an external magnetic field, the magnetic moment of
an electron can be symbolized by a vector representing the orientation of the
magneticmomentwithrespecttotheexternalfield(thinarrowsinFigure1.15).
Depending on the spin of the electron, the magnetic moment can be either ori-
entated with or against the external magnetic field. These two orientations are
assignedα-orβ-spin,respectively.Duetoquantummechanicalreasons,itisnot
orientated exactly parallel to the external field but slightly tilted. In addition, it
rotates around the axis of this external field. Further details of the properties of
spin states will be discussed in Chapter 4. Here, it shall only be noted that the

only a single state is possible in an external magnetic field, which is defined as

unpaired electrons do not cancel each other out (thick arrows in Figure 1.15).
The individual magnetic moments of the two unpaired electrons can be com-
bined in three ways (αα, ββ, αβ) in an external magnetic field. This is the origin
forthenametripletstate(T).SandTarealso calledthemultiplicityofanelec-
tronic state. Because electrons with the same spin cannot be simultaneously at
the same place (Pauli’s rule) the repulsive interactions between these electrons
aregenerallysmaller.Asaconsequence,tripletstatesareusuallylowerinenergy
thantherespectivesingletstates.
Figure 1.16 shows how the formation of a triplet state typically takes place.
Thetripletstateisusuallyalsopopulatedfromthevibrationalgroundstateofan
excited singlet state, S (v´=0). The corresponding transition, S ÎT , is called
1 1 1
intersystem crossing. As in the case of internal conversion, intersystem crossing
isfavouredwhenagoodoverlapexistsbetweenvibrationalwavefunctionsofthe
excited singlet state, S , with vibrational wave functions of the triplet state, T
1 1
[Figure 1.16, (1.7)]. In comparison to fluorescence or internal conversion, the
process of intersystem crossing is usually a lot less probable. Intersystem cross-
ing requires a change of the total spin of the electron that corresponds to a
change of the angular momentum. However, it is a fundamental law that the
overallangularmomentumofanisolatedsystemmustremainconstant.Because
there are only verylimited possibilities to compensate for the changein angular
momentum such spontaneous flips in the spin of electrons are rather unlikely
andarethereforecalledspinforbidden.Onlywhenthechangeinthespinangu-
lar momentum can be compensated by certain mechanisms can such spin flips
happen. An important example fur such a mechanism is spin–orbit coupling in
which, in a classical picture, a change in the angular momentum describing the

After intersystem crossing, vibrational excitation is also usually generated,
which is again dissipated within femto- to picoseconds until the molecule

transitions involving a change in multiplicity. Nonradiative de-excitation or
intersystemcrossing,T ÎS ,isalsopossible.Similartotheinternalconversion,

S ÎS , the probability for this process depends on overlap integrals such as

an overall result, many biomolecules and fluorescence markers rarely undergo
intersystemcrossingtothetripletstates,butonceatripletstatehasbeenformed

The generally lower energy of the triplet states cause the phosphorescence to
appear at longer wavelengths than fluorescence (Figure 1.17). Similarly to fluo-
rescence, the phosphorescence spectrum often appears to be a mirror image of
the ground-state absorption, because the vibrational modes are often very simi-
larinallelectronicstates.

energy levels, are depicted as horizontal lines. As mentioned earlier, all radiative
processes (absorption or emission of a photon) are depicted using straight arrows,
