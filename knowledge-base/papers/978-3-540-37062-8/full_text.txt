Preface
Magnetism is one of the key physical properties of materials and every
material has its own magnetism. Magnetism is divided into three groups,
ferromagnetism, paramagnetism and diamagnetism. For example, metal
iron is ferromagnetic, oxygen gas is paramagnetic and water is
diamagnetic. It is a dream of chemists and physicists to use this physical
property for controlling chemical and physical processes. However, this
novel idea was not accepted until recently, except for the use of
ferromagnetism. Since magnetic energy of paramagnetic and diamagnetic
material is very much smaller than the thermal energy at room
temperature, it was believed to be insufficient to overcome the activation
energy associated with chemical and physical processes. Very recently,
technology on manufacturing superconducting magnets has shown great
progress and chemists and physicists can now use a strong magnetic field
of 10 T or so without difficulty.
From 1992 to 1994, as a part of a research project "Molecular
Magnetism" (Project leader, Koh-ichi Ito), supported by a Grant-in-Aid for
Scientific Researchs on Priority Areas from the Ministry of Educafion,
Science, and Culture, Japan, magnetic field effects (MFEs) in photo
chemical reactions and related phenomena were studied extensively. Since
then, several national research projects on MFEs in a wide variety of
chemical and physical processes were carried out in Japan, as the
importance of high magnetic field has been recognized. Three years ago, a
three-year research project, "Innovative Utilization of High Magnetic
Field" (Project leader, Masuhiro Yamaguchi) was started with the support
of a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas from the
Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan.
From the above research, many interesting phenomena, which can hardly
be detected in a low magnetic field (< ca. 1 T), have been observed. The
marvelous finding of these results is that even chemical and physical
processes associated with diamagnetic materials, which are major
materials on earth, are significantly affected by high magnetic fields. For
example, the Moses effect, magnetic orientation of organic polymers and
gels and carbon nanotubes, magnetic levitation of diamagnetic materials,
and pseudo-microgravity generated by magnetic force have been observed.

X Preface
These newly found magnetic phenomena will be very useful for processing
functional molecules with improved quality. This brand new research field,
covering MFEs in chemical and physical processes of diamagnetic,
paramagnetic and ferromagnetic materials, is named magneto-science.
Jiki-Kagaku,"^ summarizing the research on magneto-science in Japan,
was published in 2002. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first book
introducing this novel field of magneto-science. However, the monograph
is written in Japanese, limiting its audience. The aim of the present volume
is to present the highlights of research on magneto-science conducted in
Japan as well as in other countries, since magneto-science will become one
of the basic sciences supporting materials sciences, nano- and life-sciences
and since there are potentially many far-reaching technological
applications to various areas in industry.
This volume is arranged in such a way that it will serve not only as a
reference for specialists and nonspecialists, but also as a review citing
much of the extensive literature related to this field. After introducing the
basic concepts of magneto-science in Chapter 1, examples of various types
of MFEs are systematically presented: effects of magnetic force, effects of
Lorentz force and MHD, magneto-thermodynamic effects, magnetic
orientation, dynamic spin chemistry, and novel effects of high magnetic
fields are presented in Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, respectively.
The editors express their sincere thanks to the contributors for their
kind cooperation and also to Mr. Ippei Ohta of Kodansha Scientific Ltd.
for his invaluable editorial assistance. Thanks are also due to the Japan
Society for Promotion of Sciences, Japan, for supporting this publication
with a Grant-in-Aid for Publication of Scientific Research Results.

Fundamentals of Magnetic Field Effects
Magnetic energy is smaller than thermal energy or electric
energy. The magnetic energy of an electron spin of 1 Bohr
magneton in a field of IT corresponds to thermal energy of
0.67 K or electric energy of 58 //V. Furthermore, thermal
disturbance reduces magnetic energy in nonferromagnetic
systems. It is 12.5 mJ mol"^ in 1 T at 300 K for a paramagnetic
system. This is about 10"^ the thermal energy of 2.5 kJ mol"^ at
the same temperature. Consequently, it does not seem that
magnetic field effects (MFEs) occur at ordinary or elevated
temperatures at which materials are processed. However, a
variety of MFEs were found first in selected systems and later
in popular systems by utilizing appropriate mechanisms based
on quantum mechanics, electromagnetism and magnetic
properties of materials.
In this chapter, we first introduce the quantum mechanical
or electromagnetic origins of MFEs associated with the
summary of the quantities and units in magnetism. The
fundamental mechanism of magneto-thermodynamic effects,
magnetic force effects and quantum mechanical effect (dynamic
spin chemistry) are then described. Recent developments in
magnet technology have helped the discovery of these MFEs. In
many cases, MFEs are enhanced in proportion to the square of
the magnetic field strength. This chapter also describes the
science and technology of high magnetic field generation.
1.1 Basis of Magneto-science
1.1,1 Origins of Magnetic Field Effects
Magnetic field effects (MFEs) are classified according to the time-space
properties of fields (steady or time-varying, and homogeneous or gradient
ones) as listed in Table 1-1-1. This classification depends on the MFEs
themselves, not on practical applied fields. If, for instance, a magnetic
effect occurs in a much smaller region compared to the spatial variation of

an applied gradient field, it is regarded as a homogeneous field. When a
magnetic effect proceeds and terminates within a shorter period than the
duration of an applied pulsed field, it can be considered to be steady.
Time-varying magnetic fields can induce large MFEs via the
induction of eddy current or the injection of energy. We, however, focus
our main interest on the MFEs induced by steady fields, both homogeneous
and gradient, in this volume. Below, we briefly introduce the origins of
MFEs referring to the epoch-making findings listed in Table 1-1-2.
A. Quantum Effect
In the quantum theory, the particle which possesses spin S is accompanied
by magnetic moment. This magnetic moment interacts with magnetic field
B by the Zeeman effect. This interaction is expressed by the Hamiltonian
for an electron.
H = -gll^S^B (1)
where g is the g-factor (g = 2 for the electron spin) and JUB is the Bohr

--- Page 23 ---

1.1 Basis of Magneto-science 3
magneton. The z-component of the spin is 5^= -1/2 and 1/2 when the z-axis
is along the magnetic field. Consequently, the state of the electron spin is
split into two energy levels in the magnetic field.
Frequently, radicals with unpaired electrons appear during a chemical
reaction. Magnetic fields can influence the kinetics or the yields of some
chemical reactions due to the radicals.'^^ In the early stage of a photo-
induced radical reaction, two radicals make a radical pair at the total spin
with the singlet state 5 = 0 or the triplet state S =1 while the energy level of
the singlet state is not split by a magnetic field and the triplet state is split
into three energy levels assigned by 5,= -1, 0, 1. The yields of final
reaction products depend on the singlet or the triplet state in the early stage
of the reaction. Hence, both states convert to each other at a certain
probability by magnetic fields. As a consequence, the yields of the final
products vary with the strength of magnetic fields. This is called the
radical pair mechanism of the MFE and was clearly verified in the
photodecomposition of dibenzoyl peroide.^^
B. Magneto-thermodynamic Effect
Every substance has the magnetic free energy Gm more or less under the
influence of a magnetic field. If the magnetic free energy is considerably
different between the reactant and the product sides in a reaction, the
reaction tends to proceed towards the side with the lower magnetic free
energy. This is called the magneto-thermodynamic effect. The same
situation can occur in first-order phase changes also. When all components
which take part in the reaction or phase change are paramagnetic or
diamagnetic, the change in magnetic free energy is written
AGm=--^AxB' (2)
where Ax is the change in susceptibility per reaction or phase change and
/lo is the permeability of a vacuum. (The exact expression is given in
section 1.2.) The value of AGm is on the order of 1 J mol"^ even when B
=10 T. This is much smaller than the thermal energy of 2.5 kJ mol"' at
room temperature by a factor of about 10 ^ Therefore, the magneto-
thermodynamic effect cannot be detected even under high magnetic fields
of 10-30 T which can be supplied by current magnets. However, if
ferromagnefic components take part in a reacfion or phase change, the
change in magnetic free energy becomes so large that it is several or
several tens of percent of the thermal energy because of a large change in
magnetization AM.
AGm = -AMB (3)
This was first exemplified by the MFE on the chemical equilibrium of
ferromagnetic metal hydride-hydrogen reactions: Applying magnetic fields
to the ferromagnetic LaCosH^ and hydrogen system induces increase in the

--- Page 24 ---

4 1 Fundamentals of Magnetic Field Effects
equilibrium hydrogen pressure, which is a measure of the chemical
equilibrium.^^ The MFE on a phase change was found in the magnetic
field-induced martensitic transformations in ferrous alloys.'*^
C. Magnetic Force
If a magnetic body is positioned in a gradient field, the body is acted on by
a magnetic force, called the Faraday force, as
F^ = VM^ = V^B^ (4)
az fJ.Q dz
where V is the material volume and M is the magnetization. The second
equality folds on a paramagnetic or diamagnetic substance with the
susceptibility x- This force is very weak for usual diamagnetic substances
in ordinary fields. Recently, however, we can enhance the product B(dB/dz)
with the aid of high field magnets. Consequently, some diamagnetic
substances, such as water and organic compounds, can be levitated in air
by applied fields which range up to 20 T or more.^^ Thus new functional
materials can be synthesized under micro-gravity in laboratories on Earth,
not in space.
Meanwhile, the free surface of water is deformed by magnetic fields
of several Tesla. This is termed the Moses effect.^^ Furthermore, the
diamagnetic levitation and the Moses effect can be enhanced by using a
counter paramagnetic liquid. This is called the magnetic Archimedes effect
analogous to the usual Archimedes effect.^^
D. Magnetic Torque and Alignment
The magnetic free energy of a magnetic body, including paramagnetic and
diamagnetic bodies, is expressed by
Gm = -VM' B = -VMB cos 6 (5)
where 6 is the angle between the magnetization M and the field B. As a
consequence, the body undertakes the magnetic torque T as
T = -^^ = VMB^me (6)
de
Here, the torque acts around the axis perpendicular to both M and B. This
torque is very weak for a single diamagnetic molecule. But the magnetic
torque becomes capable of overcoming the thermal disturbance if a
molecular assembly is formed with A^=10'^-10^ molecules. Consequently,
the molecular assemblies are aligned by magnetic fields and show
anisotropics in macroscopic properties. This magnetic alignment was first
indicated in the biological material of fibrin fibers^^ and later in a variety of
substances, such as crystalline polymers^^ and organic gels.'^^
E. Lorentz Force and MHD
An electric charge q which moves with the velocity v in the magnetic field

1.1 Basis of Magneto-science 5
B is acted on by the Lorentz force F as
F = qvXB (7)
For fluid matter, liquid and gaseous, the interacting force / between an
electric current density i and the magnetic field B is given by
f=ixB (8)
This is the base of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Every chemical
reaction inevitably includes some ions in the process. The ions are forced
to move perpendicular to both the current and the field. This is typical in
electrochemical reactions. The MHD effect was first investigated in
macroscopic systems of electrolysis,^'^ and more recently for microscopic
systems in relation to the morphology of electrochemical products.'^^
1.1.2 Quantities and Units in Magnetism
Magneto-science is related not only to magnetism but also to various
scientific and technological fields. We must simultaneously treat different
kinds of quantities, e. g. mechanical, thermal, electric, chemical and others.
Unfortunately, there are diverse definitions of the quantities and unit
systems in magnetism. Original papers in magnetism are mostly described
in CGS units even now. However, SI units (MKS units) are now widely
used in other fields. As a result, we encounter serious difficulties
frequently in nomenclature and numerical calculations. The best and only
way to overcome this difficulty is to conform to SI units in magneto-
science. Let us reconfirm the basic quantities in magnetism and their units.
A. Fields in Magnetism
The magnetic flux density B [T = Wb m"^] involves contributions by the
magnetic field strength H [A m"'] and magnetization M [A m"' = J T"'m"^]
while brackets [ ] denote SI units.
B=HoH + idoM (9)
where jUo is the permeability of a vacuum (//o= 4;r x 10"^ H m"'). When an
isolated body is placed in the external field He, the demagnetization field
Hd is produced in the body. This originates in the continuity of magnetic
flux density B.
H = He^Hci (10)
Eventually,
B = fioHe + ldoHd+HoM (11)
It is noted that the quantity I = JUQM [T = Wb m"^] is defined as the
magnetic polarization in SI units.

--- Page 26 ---

1 Fundamentals of Magnetic Field Effects
B. Susceptibility and Permeability
The magnetization curve shows the H-dependence of magnetization Af.
The ferromagnet has a nonhnear, nonsingle value dependence called the
hysteresis curve. In other substances, the magnetization is proportional to
the magnetic field strength.
M = xH (12)
where x [absolute number] is the (volume) susceptibility. The
susceptibility is positive and negative for paramagnetic and diamagnetic
substances, respectively.
In an anisotropic medium, the susceptibility must be expressed by a
symmetrical second-rank tensor as
MC 'Xn Xn Xn' '//l
Ml = I2I Z22 X23 IHi iX'J=Xji) (13)
Mi .Xi' X32 x». [H.
where the subscripts 1, 2 and 3 denote the jc, y and z axes in the Cartesian
coordinate, respectively. ^^^ In general, the symmetrical second-rank tensor
posses the principal axes. That is, the tensor is represented by a simple
form when it refers to the principle axes.
Mi' 'Xi 0 0" •//l
Ml = 0 X2 0 //2 (14)
Mi .0 0 XK [Hi
where X\^ X2 and X3 are the principal components of the susceptibility
tensor. The three principal components are equal for an isotropic substance
(;f 1= X2= Xr)^ two of them are equal but the third is different for a uniaxial
substance (xi= Xi^X^ ^"d all of them are different from each other for a
biaxial substance iXx^X^^X^)-
The permeability // [H m'] is defined by the following equation.
B=^iH (15)
In an anisotropic medium, the permeability is a symmetrical second-rank
tensor [ju,y] like the susceptibility tensor.
C. Magnetic Quantities of Materials
The total magnetization Mxox [J T"'] of a system is given by
Mtot=jdvM = VM (16)
V
Here the second equality holds when the magnetization is homogeneous in
the system volume V [m^]. In materials science, the magnetization is
frequently measured in mass magnetization a [J T"' kg''] or in molar
magnetization Mmoi [J T"' mol"']. The magnetization possessed by an atom,
molecule, ion or electron is expressed by the magnetic moment fi [J T"'].
The susceptibility x is usually defined by Eq.(12); alternatively, we

can introduce a different definition of the susceptibility K as
M = K(iiioH) = KBO, (K = //jUo) (17)
where ^o simply represents /UQH. This susceptibility K [J T~^ m'^] is very
convenient to use because of (1) easier numerical conversion from CGS
units, which are traditionally adopted in magnetism, to MKS units and (2)
more understandable physical meaning of units compared to the usual
susceptibility x- For instance, the mass susceptibility x
1 erg

possibly gets rid of the eyesore of Ho from electromagnetic formulae. The
Faraday force presented by Eq.(4) is simplified as
F, = VKB^ (18)

where B = JHQH [T]. Table 1-1-3 lists the conversion between CGS units and
MKS units.
D. Demagnetization Field
The demagnetization field appears more or less in every magnetized body.

--- Page 28 ---

8 1 Fundamentals of Magnetic Field Effects
even a paramagnetic or diamagnetic one. In general, the demagnetization
field depends on the figure of the body and the distribution of the external
field. But the demagnetization field is uniform and proportional to the
magnetization when an ellipsoidal body is located in a uniform field, i. e.,
Hd=^-NM (19)
where N [positive absolute number] is called the demagnetization factor.
Its value is numerically calculated for general ellipsoids and exactly
formulated for ellipsoids of revolution, which approximate the figure of a
sample in many experiments.^^ '^^
Usually, it is allowable to treat the magnetic field strength H as being
equal to the external field H^ in nonferromagnetic substances. Let us
consider the influence of the demagnetization field on the susceptibility
exactly. Substituting Eqs.(lO) and (19) for Eq.(12) leads to
= ;t{//e-N;t(//e-^M)} = --- = ;f/fe{i + (-^;f)+(-N;f)'+---} = Y^//e^^^^
Therefore, the effective susceptibility x^ff against the external field //e is
given by
Xcff=Y^^(\-mX (21)
The demagnetization factor A^ depends on the principal axes of an ellipsoid
while N\+N2+N3=l. Consequently, the effective susceptibility depends on
the direction for an ellipsoidal body with isotropic susceptibility.

1.2 Magnetic Energy and Magneto-thermodynamic Effects
In this section, we deduce the MFEs of the thermodynamic properties of
chemical reactions and phase changes on the basis of electromagnetism
and thermodynamics. As a result, systematic formulae are derived for the
magnetic field-induced changes in the thermodynamic properties, such as
the equilibrium constant, heat of reaction, critical temperature of phase
change, etc.
1.2.1 Magnetic Energy and Free Energy
A. Magnetic Energy
When a system undergoes an infinitesimal magnetic change, the magnetic
work into the system is expressed by
dWrna,=ldvHdB (1)
V
where V is the volume of the system, v the volume element, H the magnetic
field strength and dB the infinitesimal change in the magnetic flux
density*^ Here, the magnetic flux density B is contributed by the external
field He, the demagnetization field Hd and the magnetization M as written
by Eq.(ll) in section 1.1. As a consequence, the magnetic work is
decomposed into
dWmag =jdvidoHcdHc-^jdviJoHcdM
^ ^ (2)
= jdv//o//edHe+Jdv)UoHddHd+jJv/ioHdM
V V V
Because the first term on the far right hand-side is the magnetic work
required to produce the magnetic field in a vacuum, it can be eliminated
when working in the field of materials science.^^ The second term is the
magnetic work required to produce the demagnetization field. The third
term is that required to magnetize the substance, which is determined by
the magnetization curve M vs. ^ as a thermodynamic property. Therefore,
when we are interested in the thermodynamic properties of a substance, the
magnetic energy is written by
dUmag=\dviHoHdM (3)
On the other hand, when dealing with the magnetic energy of a real body
of magnetic substance, we must include the term of the demagnetization
field.

B. Free Energy and Chemical Potential
In this chapter, we employ Eq.(3) as the magnetic energy to investigate the
thermodynamic behavior of a system.^^ We assume, for simplicity's sake,
that the magnetic field strength H and the magnetization M are
homogenous in the whole system. Thus,
d L^mag = j d vjUo^ d M = ^QH d M tot (5)
V
where Mtot is the total magnetization of the system as defined by Eq.(16) in
section 1.1. Then the first law of thermodynamics includes the magnetic
term as
/=i
where U is the internal energy, S entropy, V volume, T temperature, P
pressure and A^i, A^2, ..., A^n and jUi, jU2, ..., jUn are the mole numbers and
chemical potential of components 1, 2, ..., n, respectively. The internal
energy L^ is a function of the extensive parameters of 5, V, TVi, A^2, .., Nn
and Mtot.
The free energy G is a function of the intensive parameters of 7, P, H
(in place of the extensive parameters 5, V, Mtot in U) and the extensive
parameters NuNi, .... A^n. This is obtained by the Legendre transformation.
G=U-TS + PV-HQHM,oi (7)
As a matter of fact, its infinitesimal variation of G is given by
dG = -SdT+VdP + ^HidN,-HoM,oxdH (8)
The total magnetization is the sum of the magnetization of the constituent
components.
n
Mtot = \dvM = ^ N,mi (9)

where mi is the molar magnetization of the /-th component. Accordingly,
the infinitesimal variation in free energy takes the form
dG = -SdT-\-VdP+J^lLi,dNi-J^HoNimidH (10)
Because two kinds of the second-rank partial derivatives in relation to H
and Ni are equal to each other,"^^

Thus, the infinitesimal variation in free energy is
dG = -5dr + VdP + J(Ai/'^+/x/'"^)dM-X/ioMm,dif (13)
Eqs. (12) and (13) are basic relations to investigate the MFEs on the
thermodynamic properties of chemical reactions and phase changes.
1.2.2 Chemical Equilibrium in Magnetic Fields
A. Condition of Equilibrium
When a system achieves equilibrium under the influence of constant
temperature r, pressure P and magnetic field strength //, the free energy G
must be minimum for a hypothetical change in mole numbers M (/ =1, 2...,
n\
m
^oNi JT.P.N,*N,.H ,, ..
\dNi JT.P,NJ:^N,M
Meanwhile, a chemical reaction is generally written by
where v, and A, are the stoichiometric coefficient and the molecular
formula of the i-ih component while v, is negative for the reactants
(/=1, ...,/?) and positive for the products (/ = /7+l, ..., n). The changes in
mole numbers can be represented by one parameter, the extent of reaction
^ as
dM=V/d(^, (/ = l,2,-s«) (16)
Consequently, the conditions for equilibrium Eq. (14) are rewritten into
dG
^S )T,P,H
Taking into account Eq. (13), the first condition for the chemical
equilibrium Eq. (17) gives the relation
i{^ir^^ir)v.=^ (18)
By defining the nonmagnetic free energy change g^^^ and the magnetic free
energy change g^""^ per hypothetical unit reaction (d(^ =1 mol), this becomes

--- Page 32 ---

12 1 Fundamentals of Magnetic Field Effects
^(o,+^(.)^0, fg"" = Xv,/i,'°', g""' = Xv,/i,""'l (19)
V /=i i=\ J
This means that the magnetic free energy change g^""^ counterbalances the
nonmagnetic free energy change g^"^ at chemical equilibrium under the
influence of a magnetic field.
If all components are paramagnetic or diamagnetic, the magnetization
is proportional to the magnetic field strength.
m, = ;f,// = {x^ I lUo){HoH) = K,B (20)
where Ki [J T~^ mol"^] is the molar susceptibility of the /-th component.

In the case of ferromagnetic components, the magnetization is not a simple
function of the magnetic field strength. However, we can assume that the
magnetization is saturated up to the saturation magnetization of m^'\ [J T"^
mol"*] even in low fields. Therefore,
g('")=-Jv, J ^i,m^r^H = -ii,H±vM''=-Bt,yM'' (22)
/=i //io '=1 '=1
B. Direction and Gibbs Phase Rule of Reactions
We investigate the second condition of chemical equilibrium Eq. (17). This
relation is transformed into the following inequality after some
mathematical derivation.'*^
This inequality means that an increase in magnetic field shifts the reaction
towards the direction in which the total magnetization of the system is
increased, and vice versa.
Let us suppose a system which is composed of c chemical reactions,
n components and m phases under the influence of temperature r, pressure
P and magnetic field strength H. This system has « -i- 3 intensive
parameters of r, P, H, ^i, ^2, ..., A^n while they satisfy m Gibbs-Duhem
relations and c equations of chemical equilibrium Eq. (17). Therefore, the
number of independent intensive parameters, the degree of freedom, is
F = « + 3-m-c (24)
This is the Gibbs phase rule of chemical reactions under the influence of a
magnetic field. For instance, the liquid-gas phase change of a substance A
has the degree of freedom F = 2 because there is no reaction (c = 0)

--- Page 33 ---

1.2 Magnetic Energy and Magneto-thermodynamic Effects 13
between the unchanged component A (« =1) in the two phases (m = 2).
Alternatively, we can assume that there is one reaction (c = 1) between two
components of Auquid and Agas (n = 2) in the respective phases (m = 2).
Accordingly, the phase change occurs on the equilibrium plane in the
three-dimensional T-P-H space.
1.2.3 Magnetic Field Effects on Thermodynamic Quantities
A. Equilibrium Constant
First, we assume an ideal gas reaction in which the nonmagnetic chemical
potential of the i-ih component is given by
ju/'^=jU,*+/?nn(/?/P*) (25)
where P* is the standard pressure (ordinarily P*=latm) and /i,* is the
standard chemical potential at temperature T and standard pressure P*.
Accordingly, the condition of the chemical equilibrium of Eq. (18) is
rewritten to
J^Vi{Hi^-\-Hi''"') = -RTj^Vi\n(Pi /P*) = -RT\nK, (26)
where Kp is the (pressure) equilibrium constant which is a function of 7, P
and H. Comparing the equilibrium constant in a magnetic field and that in
zero field leads to
pi'") n
ln^p""-ln^pi''i=-^^—, iKp=YliPi/P*r') (27)
RT j=i
where Kp ^"^ and Kp ^^^ are the equilibrium constant in the magnetic field and
that in zero field, respectively. Below, we use similar notations for other
quantities.
For instance, suppose that one component (/ =g) is gaseous and the
others are in a solid or liquid phase in a reaction. In this case, the
equilibrium P is dominated by the pressure of the gaseous component. If
every component is paramagnetic or diamagnetic, the MFE on the
equilibrium pressure is expressed by
ln(p[^i/p(0])^. =J?i_^v,7C, (28)
2RT i=i
Similarly, for a ferromagnetic system,
ln(pf//I/pf01)v. ^A.fy.^is^ (29)
RTtt
In the case of an ideal solution reaction, the nonmagnetic chemical
potential is given by
iU/°^ = ^/*+/?rin(jc,/x*) (30)
where ;c* is the standard concentration and /i,* is the standard chemical
potential at temperature T and standard concentration JC*. Thus, the MFE
on the (concentration) equilibrium constant Kx is expressed by equations
similar to Eq. (27) while P//P* is replaced by JC//;C*.

14 1 Fundamentals of Magnetic Field Effects
B. Electromotive Force
An electrochemical system is composed of two half cells. Each half cell is
a reaction like Eq. (15), consisting of two phases, the a and the p phases in
which the components (/=1, 2, ..., r) and the components (/ = r+1, r+2,...,
s) are included, respectively. The chemical potential of the i-ih component
includes the nonelectromagnetic, the electronic and the magnetic terms as
/// =/z/'^ +/i/^^ +^/'"^ =/i, *+/?rin(jc, /x*) + z/F^a +/i/"^ (31)
where jc* is the standard concentration, jc/ and z, are the concentration and
the valence of the /-th component, respectively, F is the Faraday constant
and *Fa is the electric potential for the a phase (*Pp for the p phase). In this
case, the equilibrium condition Eq. (18) is replaced by
t,{i^i'''-^^r-^nry,=o 02)
This leads to the electromotive force E of the half cell.^^
£ = ^„-«Fp=^^v,(/x,*+/?nn(;c,/jc*) + /i/'"0 (33)
fq i=i
where Fq is the total charge transfer by the unit reaction (d<^=l mol).
r s
q = - X^'^'= X^'^' (34)
(a phase) ((5 phase)
Thus, the magnetic field-induced change in the electromotive force is
Fq i=\ Fq
where g^""^ is the magnetic free energy change for the half cell.
Now we go on to the full cell, which is composed of two electrodes
and electrolyte solution. That is, one half cell consists of one electrode
(Phase a) and the solution (Phase p) and the other one consists of the
solution (Phase p) and the other electrode (Phase y). The entire reaction is
expressed by Eq. (15) when the two electrodes do not contribute to it.
Applying Eq. (35) to both half cells and adding them gives the MFE on the
electromotive force between the two electrodes.
A£ = £[/^]_£[o]^(^^^^)[//i_(^^_^yoi^_Lf ^^y.)^_L^(-) (36)
Fql^x Fq
Where n is the number of constituent components in the solution, g"""^ is the
magnetic free energy change for the reaction and Fq is the total charge
contributing to the reaction. This is rewritten to the following equation for
the paramagnetic or diamagnetic system.
A£ = ^l;v,7C, (37)
2Fq /=i
It is easy to adapt this consideration to the MFE on the electromotive force
in gradient magnetic fields.^^

1.2 Magnetic Energy and Magneto-thermodynamic Effects 15
C. Heat, Free Energy and Entropy of Reaction
A chemical reaction is accompanied by the heat of reaction (the enthalpy
change) Aff, the free energy of reaction (the free energy change) ACf and
the entropy of reaction (the entropy change) A5^ when it occurs between
the components at the standard pressure P*, temperature T and magnetic
field strength H. These three thermodynamic quantities are possibly a
function of T and H and they are related to each other as
AH = AG^TAS (38)
where the superscript ^ is omitted from the notation for simplification. The
free energy of reaction is connected to the equilibrium constant.
AG = -RT\nKp (39)
Consequently, the magnetic field-induced change in AG is obtained by
^G^^i - AG^'^ = -RT{\n K,'"' - In ^p^^^) = g'^' (40)
Furthermore, the heat of reaction is expressed by the van't Hoff relation.
AAHH == /R?Tr''——\lnnKA,: p (41)
dT '
Thus, the magnetic field-induced change in AH is given by
A//t^] - A^io] ^ ^(m) _ 7 A^(-) (42)
dT
Finally, using Eq. (38) gives
A5t^]_A5i«]=_A^(-) (43)
oT
The formulae of Eqs. (41)-(43) are applicable to a solution or solid
reaction. It is noted that Eq. (43) is common to the case of magnetic
refrigeration (heat)."^^
D. Phase Change
Two phases coexist in a first-order phase change. For instance, a liquid-gas
phase change is
Aiiquid = Agas (44)
Accordingly, this phase change is expressed by vi=-l and V2=l in Eq. (15).
All of the formulae obtained above can be applied to this phase change.
We assume that the system is paramagnetic or diamagnetic with the molar
susceptibility of KI for the liquid (Phase 1) and K2 for the gas (Phase 2). Eq.
(21) yields the magnetic free energy change per unit mole reaction.
^(-)=-15^(^2-^i) = -^^'AfC, {ki=Xi^l^o,B = ^oH) (45)
Eventually, using Eq. (28) gives the MFE on the equilibrium pressure in
the gas phase.

Because the degree of freedom is 2 for the phase change under the
influence of magnetic fields, there are two independent parameters among
temperature 7, pressure P and magnetic field H, If the pressure is fixed, the
phase equilibrium is determined by T and H, That is, the critical
temperature of the phase change is a function of magnetic field ff at a
constant pressure.
We have one of the Maxwell relations for a magnetic system.

Meanwhile, the change in free energy AG is zero on the equilibrium plane
in relation to Eq. (38).
TAS = AH, (A5=52-5,,A// = //2-//i) (48)
Using the above two equations leads to
dJUoH)^ AH
dT TAm
where AH and Am are the heat of enthalpy and the molar magnetization
change from Phases 1 to 2. This is the magnetic Clapeyron-Clausius
equation. If the two phases are paramagnetic or diamagnetic with an
isotropic susceptibility of KI or K2, it is
Am = m2-mi=K2B-K\B = BAK (50)
Accordingly,
i dr = - ^ d5 (51)

Eventually, the magnetic field-induced change in the critical temperature is
given by

where we reasonably assume that the magnetic field-induced changes in
AH and the critical temperature To are small.

1.3 Effects of Magnetic Orientation, Magnetic Force and
Lorentz Force
1,3.1 Magnetic Orientation
A. Magnetic Orientation Due to Magnetic Susceptibility Anisotropy^^
Usually a molecule has anisotropic magnetic susceptibilities. For example,
diamagnetic susceptibility of benzene parallel to the molecular plane is
different from that perpendicular to the plane. This anisotropy arises from
the magnetic induction of a ring current when the magnetic field is applied.
Therefore, the magnetic energy is orientation-dependent and energetically
the molecule undergoes molecular orientation to the most stable direction.
However, the energy of a molecule is negligibly small compared with the
thermal energy at room temperature, and, as a result, the magnetic
orientation of a single molecule is only expected to occur at very low
temperatures.
In contrast to the magnetic energy of a molecule, aggregates, which
have an ordered structure like a crystal, can obtain anisotropic magnetic
energies larger than the thermal energy at room temperature. This is
because the anisotropic magnetic energy of an aggregate increases with
increasing volume, whereas its translational thermal energy, randomizing
its orientation, is constant, regardless of volume. For the purpose of
simplicity, we assume here that an aggregate is composed of n moles of
molecules, has a cylindrical shape and has molecular diamagnetic
susceptibilities ;fmoii and ;fmoiii, which are the susceptibilities perpendicular
and parallel to the cylindrical axis, z (see Fig. 1-3-1). Then the magnetic
energy £:mag of the aggregate in a magnetic field, //, is given,
£n,ag(0,H) = -(1 / l)^ion iXn^ou cos' e-f Xr^oXL sin' e)H^
= ~(l/2)/lon(;fmoIl+(;i:molH -;fmoll)COs'0)//' (1)
= -(1 / 2)^iQn {XrnoXL H- A;|fnioi cos' e)H^
where e is the angle between the magnetic field and the cylindrical axis, z,
and Axmoi (= Xmom - Xmou) is the anisotropic magnetic susceptibility. Fig.l-
3-2 shows schematically the angular dependence of ^mag {0, H) when Xmoin
< Xmou < 0. Putting the anisotropic magnetic energy A£mag {H) = £^mag(0, H) -
£^mag (^/2, //), the aggregate undergoes magnetic orientation when ACmag {H)
becomes larger than the thermal energy.
It is notable that AEm^g(H) is dependent on n. This means that the size
of an aggregate is a very important factor in magnetic orientation. An
aggregate with small Axmoi can undergo magnetic orientation when it is
large in size, i.e., large «, or under a higher magnetic field, compared with

depends on n, A^magC//) of an aggregate can exceed the translational energy
simply by increasing its volume.
Angular dependence of aggregates obeys the Boltzmann distribution
law. When the orientation is limited in a two-dimensional plane, the
probability P(6, H, T) dO that the z axis of an aggregate orients at the angles
between 0 and 0 + d0 at // and temperature T is given,
P(0, HJ)(\e = exp[-£niag {e. H)/kT]de/ jj exp[-£n.ag (0, H) /kT]de (2)
where k is the Boltzmann constant. Fig. 1-3-3 shows schematically two
distribution curves P(6,H, T) of aggregates when Xmom < Xmon < 0. Keeping
H and T constant, aggregates showing curve (b) have a larger | A^moi I value
compared to those showing curve (a). Keeping AXmoi and T constant,
aggregates showing curve (b) are placed in a higher magnetic field,
compared to those showing curve (a). Keeping AXmoi and H constant,
aggregates showing curve (b) are placed at a temperature lower than those

showing curve (a). Therefore it is possible to obtain AXmoi from analysis of
Experimentally, P(e, H, T) is estimated from the number of aggregates
within angles G^^O, In this case, the width of angles, 2A0, affects the
quality of P{6,H,T)P Even using the same experimental data, a higher
field is apparently required for the magnetic orientation when A0 is small. A
lower field is apparently required for the orientation, when A0 is large.
Furthermore, crystal shape and the direction of magnetic field (horizontal
or vertical) also affect P(^,//, 7), since gravity also influences the stability
of oriented aggregates.^-^^
The degree of magnetic orientation is also expressed by using the
order parameter S{H, T), when the orientation is in a two-dimensional
plane.
5(//,r) = Jj2cos^0-l]P(^,//,r)d0 (3)
S(H,T) changes from -1 to 1. S(H,T) = 1 when all aggregates are oriented
parallel (0 = 0) to /f, S(H, T) = -\ when they are oriented perpendicular {6 =
nil) to the field, and S{H, 7) = 0 for randomly oriented aggregates.
Magnetic susceptibility of a material is given by the second-rank
symmetric tensor. When the axes of the tensor are chosen correctly, the
tensor becomes diagonal and the magnetic susceptibility of a material is
presented by using three susceptibilities, Xu X2 and x^ along the principal
axes, jci, X2 and JC3, respectively. In the case of crystals, their magnetic axes
are sometimes correlated to their crystal symmetry, as shown in Table 1-3-
1."^^ When a crystal is tetragonal, for example, its magnetic axes coincide
with the crystal axes and it has two magnetic susceptibilities. So once the
crystal system of a crystal is known, one can easily estimate the orientation
of a crystal in a magnetic field.
Thus far, the relationship between anisotropic magnetic energy and

angular distribution of aggregates has been discussed. Anisotropic
magnetic susceptibility is also related to the motion of an aggregate
suspended in viscous medium in a magnetic field.^^ When it is suspended
in viscous medium in a magnetic field, as shown in Fig. 1-3-1, an
aggregate receives the magnetic torque T{e, //),
T(e,H) = -^Em.MH)/^e = (\/2)^lonAx(sin2e)H' (4)
Thus the aggregate rotates to minimize its magnetic energy. The rotational
motion of the aggregate is given by balancing the magnetic torque and the
hydrodynamic torque,
Lde/dt = -T(d,H)
(5)
= -(\/2)HonAxisin2e)H
where t is the time.
The left-hand side of Eq. (5) is the hydrodynamic torque on the
aggregate through the surrounding viscous medium when the aggregate
rotates at an angular velocity of d6/dt. The parameter L depends on the
volume and the shape of the aggregate. The solution to Eq. (5) is
tan 6 = tan do exp (-t/r) (6)
Here Go is the initial angle between the aggregate and the magnetic field
and T is the orientation relaxation time, which is defined as
r-'=(V/L)iUoAx^H' (7)
where V is the volume of the aggregate, L the parameter representing the
shape of the aggregate, and Ax^ the anisotropic volume magnetic
susceptibility (VAx^ = n AXmoi). In the case of a sphere with radius a, L =
8 nrja^ and V = (4/3) ;ra\ where rj is the viscosity of medium. Then Eq. (7)
becomes
T-'=HOAX.H'/6TI (8)
Thus AXv is obtained from the orientation relaxation time, r. In the case of

--- Page 41 ---

1.3 Effects of Magnetic Orientation, Magnetic Force and Lorentz Force 21
an ellipsoid, the general formula of L was derived by Jeffery.^^ Therefore,
we can determine AXv (Axmoi) from r, when L can be obtained analytically.
B. Magnetic Orientation Due to Shape Anisotropy'^
Another mechanism of magnetic orientation is shape anisotropy. In this
mechanism, an aggregate with isotropic magnetic susceptibility can also
undergo magnetic orientation only if its shape is anisotropic. Its
mechanism is slightly complicated. When a diamagnetic substance is
placed in a magnetic field //, as shown in Fig. 1-3-4, it is magnetized and
magnetic poles are induced at its two ends, and because of these magnetic
poles, a magnetic field, called the demagnetizing field, //d, is induced.
^/jUo=//ex+M + //d (9)
where B is the magnetic flux density, //ex the external magnetic field and M
the magnetization. In the case of a diamagnetic substance (x < 0), //a is the
same direction as //ex, whereas the direction of Af is opposite to //ex as,
M = ;t://ex/(l + A^Z)<0 (10)
and
H, =-NM = -NxH,. / (l-^ NX)- -NxH,A\- Nx)^ -NxH,.>0 (11)
where A^ is the number of induced magnetic poles. The demagnetizing field
is proportional to N. In Fig. 1-3-4, two orientations of a diamagnetic
material are shown. The number of magnetic poles in orientation (b) is
larger than that in (a), //d in orientation (b) is larger than that in (a).
Therefore, orientation (b) is more unstable in energy than orientation (a),
since the //d of (b) is larger than that of (a). As the demagnetizing field is
dependent on the shape of the material and the magnetizing direction, as
schematically shown in Fig. 1-3-4, the magnetic energy of the material

depends on the shape and its magnetizing direction. As a result, a material
of isotropic magnetic susceptibility undergoes magnetic orientation to the
direction where its magnetic energy is minimum. Few examples of
magnetic orientation due to shape anisotropy have been reported.^'^^
However, this mechanism seems to be adapted only when their orientations
cannot be explained by their anisotropic magnetic susceptibility. Therefore,
further theoretical and experimental analysis of this mechanism is urgently
required. This mechanism is of general importance, since the orientation of
aggregates occurs simply when they have anisotropy in shape, regardless
of magnetic susceptibility.
Examples of magnetic orientation are given in Chapter 5.
1.3.2 Magnetic Force
Magnetic force arises from the interaction of the magnetism of a material
and a magnetic field. When a magnetic field is nonuniform, a substance
receives the magnetic force Fmag/^
Fmag = -dEmag /dz = jloX^dHldz (12)
where £mag is the isotropic magnetic energy, x the isotropic magnetic
susceptibility, and dHldz the gradient of H in the z-direction. Characteristics
of magnetic force are summarized in Table 1-3-2. The force is dependent
on if. It is linear and parallel or anti-parallel to that of dHldz. The force
repels diamagnetic materials (j^ < 0) to a lower magnetic field, whereas it
attracts paramagnetic materials Of > 0) to a higher field. The direction of
the force is invariant when the magnetic field direction is changed to the
opposite one.
Magnetic force is very important as a mechanical effect of magnetic
fields. For example, one can move the aqueous solution of paramagnetic
ions in water simply by using a conventional permanent magnet (0.2-
0.3 T).^^ It is possible to separate paramagnetic ions^^^ and paramagnetic
particles. ^^^
When a vessel containing water is placed in a horizontal high
magnetic field gradient, water is split into two parts, because water
(diamagnetic) is repelled out from the magnetic field. ^^^ This phenomenon
is called the Moses effect.

1.3 Effects of Magnetic Orientation, Magnetic Force and Lorentz Force 23
One can levitate many materials, water, plastics and etc., by using a
vertical high magnetic field gradient.'^^ Suppose that a diamagnetic
material, whose mass and mass magnetic susceptibility are m and j, is
placed in a vertical magnetic field. It is levitated when the magnetic force
to the material, which is opposite to gravity, is equal to gravity as a whole,
{mx/Ho)BdB/dz = mg (13)
where z is in the vertical direction. When the condition given by Eq. (13) is
held at every infinitesimal place in the material, the material is said to be
placed in pseudo-microgravity. One can levitate a water droplet
(diamagnetic) by applying a vertical magnetic force of 1360 T^m~^ against
gravity. It is also possible to prepare pseudo-hypergravity by applying the
magnetic force to the same direction to gravity.
Many examples of magnetic force are discussed in Chapter 2.
1.3.3 Lorentz Force
The Lorentz force arises from the interaction of a moving electric charge
and a magnetic field. When it moves in a magnetic field, an electrically
charged particle receives a Lorentz force FL,'^
FL=qvxB (14)
where q is the electric charge of a particle, v the velocity of the particle,
and B the magnetic flux density. Characteristics of the Lorentz force are
Usted in Table 1-3-2. This force is proportional to B (= /doH). It induces a
torque on the particle in the plane perpendicular to B, and induces
rotational motion. The direction of the torque is reversed when the
direction of B is reversed. One can differentiate the effects of the Lorentz
force and the magnetic force using Table 1-3-2.
In solution, ions and charged particles cannot move alone due to
collision with the solvent and other solutes. As a result, the Lorentz force
induces convection of the solution. This mechanism is called the
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) mechanism. It is important in not only
electrochemical reactions where electric current moves in solution but also
in processes in solution where ions move to a specific reaction zone such
as the solid/liquid interface.
Generally speaking, the speed of convection induced by the Lorentz
force in an electrochemical reaction can be estimated from the following
equation, ^"^^
aii/ar + (iiV)ii = -(l/p)VP + vV'ii + (l/p)/xB (15)
where u is the velocity of the solution, t the time, p the density of solution,
P the pressure, v the dynamic viscosity of solution, i the electric current
and B the magnetic flux density. Analysis of Eq. (15) is reported
elsewhere.^^^ The solufion of Eq. (15) depends on the experimental

--- Page 44 ---

24 1 Fundamentals of Magnetic Field Effects
conditions. In the case of anodic oxidation of iodine ions, for example, the
speed of convection is experimentally obtained to be about 16 mm s~^ at
0.6 T.^^^ MHD-induced convection is quite fast and very significantly
affects transportation from bulk solution to a reaction zone.
The direction of convection induced by the Lorentz force is also
strongly affected by the experimental conditions. The force can induce
locally small vortexes, i.e., the micro-MHD effect.'^^ With the aid of the

1.4 Dynamic Spin Chemistry
1.4.1 What Is Modern Spin Chemistry?
Classical magnetochemistry deals mainly with macroscopic magnetic
properties in chemistry,'^ whereas spin chemistry emphasizes more a
microscopic view of magnetic phenomena.^^ In other words, spin chemistry

--- Page 45 ---

1.4 Dynamic Spin Chemistry 25
can be regarded as a modem version of magnetochemistry. At present, spin
chemistry is more or less broadly defined as a research field specializing in
magnetic phenomena in chemistry, including synthesis of molecular
magnets based on organic compounds, magnetic field effects on chemical
reactions and application of magnetic resonance spectroscopy to chemical
phenomena.^^ Dynamic aspects of modern magnetochemistry may be
called dynamic spin chemistry, which is chiefly concerned with chemical
reactivity, dynamics and kinetics of magnetic phenomena in chemistry.
It was well known in the 1950's that ortho- and para-hydxogtn
interconversion is catalyzed by paramagnetic substances and dependent on
the strength of magnetic fields applied to reaction systems/^ In spite of
many attempts to induce changes in reaction rates on application of
external magnetic fields, very little reproducible and reliable data were
obtained for chemical reactions in the solution phase until the 1970's.
During the last three decades there has been substantial scientific activity
in the field of dynamic spin chemistry, mainly dealing with magnetic field
and magnetic isotope effects on chemical and biochemical reactions as
well as chemically induced spin polarization.^^ A critical step in the
development of dynamic spin chemistry was the discovery of chemically
induced dynamic nuclear polarization (CIDNP) and its interpretation on
the basis of the radical pair model.^'^^ The so-called radical pair mechanism
has turned out to be a valuable key concept for systematically investigating
magnetic field effects on chemical yields and kinetics.
One of the most important researches in spin chemistry is the
magnetic field effect on dynamical behavior of excited molecules in the
gas phase. In 1974 Matsuzaki and Nagakura found that the intensity of
fluorescence from the diamagnetic excited singlet state (*A2) of CS2 was
appreciably reduced in the presence of an external magnetic field.^^
Magnetic field quenching of emission has been observed for I2 in the
triplet state and NO2 in the doublet state. It should be noted that magnetic
quenching of CS2 has opened a new field of energy transfer of excited
molecules in the gaseous state.
1.4.2 Theoretical Background for the Radical Pair Model
The basic principle of radical pair (RP) is introduced in this subsection.
The spin Hamiltonian for an RP consisting of radicals A and B is given by
the following equations^'^^:
/fRP=X2A5AZ+r2B5BZ+//ex d)
//ex=-y(25A5B+l/2) (2)
^ A= ^AMB^O / {h I iK) + laAn /An (3)
QB=gBliiBBo/{h/2n)-\-laBmlBm (4)

where subscripts A and B refer to radical A and radical B, respectively.
Here, the direction of the external field Bo is taken as the z axis. The
coefficients ^An and asm are the hyperfine coupling constants of the n-ih
and m-th nuclei. The two spins precess around the direction of the external
field Bo with the following angular frequencies:
0)^' = gAflsBo / (h / 27t)-^ZaAn MAn (5)
COB" = SBUBBO I {hi 2K)+ 1. a^m M^m (6)
where MAO and M^m are the spin quantum numbers corresponding to h for
the n-th and m-th nuclei, respectively. The superscripts a and b refer to the
respective nuclear spin state of radicals A and B. The singlet (5) and triplet
{Tn\ n= 1, 0, -1) states of RP can be given as follows:
\S>={\aAliB>-\asPA>]/^'2 (7)
ir+i>=laAaB> (8)
iro>={laAi8B> + laBi3A>}/V2 (9)
\U>=\PAPB> (10)
The exchange term, //ex, determines the energy separation between the
singlet and triplet states (A£ = £$-£7= 27),
£=<SI//exl5>^y (11)
ET=<Ti\H,,\T,>=-J (12)
When the inter-radical distance between radicals A and B is denoted by r,
dependence of 7 on r can approximately be given by the following
expression:
J(r) = JoQxp(-^r) (13)
Since Jo is usually negative for RPs composed of neutral radicals, the r-
dependence of the energies of the singlet and triplet states is schematically
illustrated in Fig. 1-4-1 in the absence (a) and presence (b) of an external
magnetic field. Fig. 1-4-2 shows the Zeeman splitting as a function of
magnetic field strength. The most important matrix element responsible for
the intersystem crossing in the presence of the static magnetic field is
described by the following equation:
(5l//Rpiro) = (a)/-a)B')/2 = ab (14)
Kaptein^^^ has obtained the time evolution of the time-dependent wave
function y/(t) for an RP during the S-To conversion by solving the
Schrodinger equation, i(h/2n) dyA^tydt = //RP V<0. where y/it) is represented

by the product of the electron-spin states I S > and I To> and nuclear-spin
states lA^ab>:
y/(t) = {Cs(t)\S>-^Cj(t)\To>}\N,,> (15)
When the two electron spins feel a strong exchange interaction (J) at the
moment of pair production, there may be no mixing of S and To. Once two
spins are separated by a sufficiently long distance (more than 1.0 nm) and
feel negligibly small J for some extended time, the spins of A and B
precess with their respective Larmor frequency. The difference between
singlet and triplet states lies in only the phase of their spins in the vector
description of the RP model. Consequently, the phase of the two spins may
alternate as a function of time. In other words, the S and To states oscillate
quantum mechanically. This type of S-To conversion is visualized in Fig. 1-
4-3. This can be regarded as intersystem crossing which may occur in the
nanosecond time range, and the rate for S-To mixing is usually of the order
of 10' s-\

1.4.3 Experimental Methods and Examples
A wide variety of experimental methods have been applied to dynamic
spin chemistry. Above all time-resolved optical spectroscopy and magnetic
resonance are powerful tools to detect and characterize transient species. It
should be noted that optical spectroscopy excels in time resolution,
whereas magnetic resonance has strong advantages in identifying and
characterizing paramagnetic transient species. Therefore, combined use of
time-resolved optical and magnetic resonance spectroscopy is quite fruitful
in the kinetic and mechanistic studies of reactions involving radical pairs
and biradicals.
Scheme 1-4-1 summarizes a typical reaction scheme for the creation
of RP intermediates. Most of the reactions involving RPs so far
investigated may fall into the three categories shown in Scheme 1-4-1.
Laser flash photolysis or pulse radiolysis of solutions containing electron
donors and acceptors may result in the formation of radical ion pairs, while
photochemistry of carbonyl compounds often involves homolytic bond
cleavage or hydrogen abstraction.
Scheme 1-4-2 summarizes a generalized model reaction involving
radical pairs. There are two different pathways leading to end products.
One is cage product formation, and the other escape product formation. On
going from the zero field to a high field, the end product yields decrease or
increase depending on the spin multiplicity of its precursor and the nature
of reaction pathways. When the singlet-triplet spin conversion is
dominantly induced by hyperfine interaction, the cage product formation
from singlet-born separated radical pairs increases in the presence of

external magnetic fields. Table 1-4-1(a) lists changes in end product
formation in the presence of external magnetic fields when the spin
conversion is dominated by the hyperfme coupling. Table 1-4-1 (b) lists
changes in end product yields in the presence of magnetic fields when the
singlet-triplet conversion is dominated by the Zeeman interaction (A^
mechanism). Because B\/2 values {vide infra) commonly observed for
organic radical pairs containing light atoms are usually smaller than
10 mT, the magnetic field effects induced by the hyperfine coupling (HFC)
mechanism show some saturation below 50 mT. The saturation
phenomenon is characteristic of the HFC mechanism, while the magnetic

field effects due to Ag mechanism increase with increasing field strength
without saturation.
The first CIDEP effect was observed in 1963 for H atoms during
irradiation of liquid methane and methane-ethane mixture with 2.8 MeV
electrons at ca. 100 K.^^^ One of the two hyperfine lines for H atoms is
emissive and the other absorptive. This clearly shows that the population
differences of the two hyperfine levels have opposite signs as the result of
complicated polarization effects ensuing from the initial creation of the
radical pair consisting of • CH3 and • H, and subsequent recombination.
In 1967 CIDNP phenomena were independently reported by two
research groups.'''^^^ The observation of CIDNP was made for the reaction
of n-butyllithium with alkyl bromide and for thermolysis of benzoyl
peroxide in cyclohexanone solution. These reports have provided a starting
point for the vigorous development of CIDNP.
In a pioneering work published in 1969, Brocklehurst predicted that
electron paramagnetic relaxation of radical ion pairs could affect the
relative distribution of singlet and triplet recombination products.'^^ In
1974 Brocklehurst and coworkers reported magnetic field effects on the
singlet/triplet ratio in the geminate recombination of radical ion pairs
produced on pulse radiolysis in viscous squalene solutions containing
fluorene. The solutions were irradiated with 50 ns pulses of 3 MeV
electrons at doses of ca. 4 krad per pulse.''^^
The reaction scheme can be summarized as follows:
(1) ionization of solvent molecules (S): S -^ S^ + e~
(2) electron transfer from fluorene (Fl) to the solvent cation:
S^ + Fl -^ S + Fr
(3) formation of fluorene anion: Fl + e -^ Fl"
(4) radical pair formation: Fr + Fl' -^ ^[Fr Fl]
(5) singlet-triplet spin conversion: ^[Fr Fl] -^ \FV Fl]
(6) recombination of radical ion pairs and fluorescence emission:

--- Page 51 ---

1.4 Dynamic Spin Chemistry 31
^[Fr Fl] ->+^Fr+ F1->2F1 + /IVF
The fluorescence intensity from fluorene in the excited singlet state was
enhanced on application of magnetic fields (< 0.5 T). The fluorescence
intensity increased with increasing field strength (0-50 mT). The intensity
exhibited a plateau in the region above 0.1 T. It should be noted that there
may be saturation of magnetic field effects when the hyperfine interaction
dominates the intersystem crossing. The observed results are in agreement
with the theoretical prediction published in 1969 and can be explained in
terms of the radical pair model. Because fluorene in the excited singlet
state is a cage product, the yield of singlet-bom product increases when the
hyperfine coupling mechanism is dominant (see Table 1-4-1(a)).
The first experimental demonstration of the crucial role of nuclear
magnetic moments was presented by Sagdeev and coworkers in 1972.'^^
They showed that in the radical reacfion of pentafluorobenzyl chloride
C6F5CH2CI with n-butyllithium C4H9Li, the rafio of C6F5(CH2)4CH3 to
C6F5(CH2)2C6F5 in the product increased on the application of an external
magnetic field. The field dependence of singlet-triplet transitions for
radical pairs induced by hyperfine interaction (HFI) accounts for the
observed magnetic field effects. The results described in ref. 15 can be
interpreted through the hyperfine mechanism in terms of the radical pair
model. The yield of cage product C6F5(CH2)4CH3 decreases while that of
the escape product C6F5(CH2)2C6F5 increases in the presence of magnetic
fields. Recently, Wakasa and Hayashi re-examined the organometallic
reaction reported by Sagdeev and coworkers. ^^^ However, they were not
able to reproduce magnetic field effects on the end product yield.
In 1976 Schulten, Weller and collaborators'^^ demonstrated the
substantial contribution of the isotropic HFI and nuclear magnetic
moments to the efficiency of a geminate recombination for radical ion
pairs generated by laser photolysis. Weller and collaborators reported that
magnetic field effects on the yield of pyrene in the excited triplet state
formed after photolysis of solutions containing pyrene and anilines in polar
solvents at room temperature.'^^ They observed by means of nanosecond
laser photolysis that the transient absorption intensity of the excited triplet
decreased in the presence of low magnetic fields. The triplet yield at 50
mT was about 80% of the value in the zero field in methanol. The observed
results can be explained in terms of the radical pair model. In this case the
singlet-triplet spin conversion is reduced in the low field region, which
corresponds to the reduced yield of molecular excited triplet.
The reaction scheme is given below:
(1) excitation of pyrene: pyrene + HVA -> 'pyrene*
(2) electron transfer from D (anilines) to pyrene:
'pyrene* -1- D -> '[pyrene" + D""]
(3) singlet-triplet spin conversion:'[pyrene'-i-D''] -^ ^[pyrene +D^]
(4) formation of molecular excited triplet:

--- Page 52 ---

32 1 Fundamentals of Magnetic Field Effects
^[pyrene" + D""] -> "^pyrene* + D
Weller et al. have also proposed the B1/2 value, which is defined as the half
field where half the maximum field effects are observed in the following
equation:
where B^ and By are evaluated from hyperfine coupling constants observed
for radicals X and Y.
One of the typical magnetic field effects on the end-product yields
was reported by Tanimoto and collaborators in 1976.'^^ They observed a
decrease in the yield of cage product, phenyl benzoate formed in the
singlet-sensitized photolysis of benzoyl peroxide in the presence of high
magnetic fields up to 4.3 T. In this case, the A^ or Zeeman mechanism
dominates instead of the hyperfine coupling mechanism. The singlet-bom
radical pair initially consists of two benzoyloxy radicals which undergo
decarboxylation of benzoyloxy radicals, thereby forming a pair composed
of phenyl and benzoyloxy radicals. The difference in g-factor for the latter
pair is fairly large. The singlet-triplet conversion is enhanced under higher
magnetic fields when the Ag mechanism dominates. They found that
changes in cage product yields [y(B)-K(0)] are proportional to the square
root of field strength B^'^, where Y and 0 refer to the yield and zero field,
respectively. The observed results are in agreement with the prediction
based upon the radical pair model.
In 1976 Buchachenko et al. succeeded in detecting magnetic field
effects on the concentration of magnetically active heavy carbon (^^C) in
the photochemical decomposition of dibenzyl ketone in benzene and
hexane.^^^ This is one of the earliest reports on magnetic isotope effects.
Sagdeev, Molin and coworkers found magnetic isotope effects in the triplet
sensitized photolysis of benzoyl peroxide.^^^ Namely, they recorded ^^C-
NMR spectrum of the cage product, phenyl benzoate C6H5COOC6H5, and
concluded that the increase in the amount of ^^C at the C-1 position of the
phenoxy moiety was due to the increased recombination probabilities
induced by hyperfine interaction of the radical pairs containing heavy
carbon.
In 1976 Buchachenko and coworkers reported magnetic isotope
effects for heavy carbon ^"^C in photodecomposition of dibenzyl ketone
(DBK) at room temperature. On photoexcitation DBK undergoes Norrish
type I cleavage in the triplet manifold. ^^^ They found that triplet-singlet
spin conversion of radical pairs consisting of phenylacetyl and benzyl
radicals was more rapid for the pair containing the heavy carbon than for
the pair with the normal one. In other words, radical pairs containing the
heavy carbon recombine faster than the pairs with '^C, and therefore the
heavy carbon was enriched at the central carbon atom. This work clearly
shows that isotope enrichment is possible for elements composed of
magnetic and nonmagnetic nuclei by use of magnetic isotope effects.

For the case of a uniform-current-density solenoid coil, shown in Fig. 1-5-
1, magnetic fields along the z axis, Bz (T), are calculated by the following

MiiY-^m -ir-Pm (1)
where a = ailax, p = b/a\, y = z/a\, /JQ = the permeability of free space
(4;rxl0"^ NA"^), j = the current density (Am~^), a\ = the coil inner radius
(m), (32 = the coil outer radius (m), and b = the coil half height (m).
At a point far from the magnet center, p (p» ai, b), the magnet can
be seen as a magnetic dipole. The magnetic fields Br and Bz decreased with
p^ The following relation was shown:
BAO.p) = -2BAp.O) (2)
By using Eqs. (1) and (2), stray fields can be roughly estimated.
A numerical calculation is necessary for magnetic fields around the
magnet except in the central zone. The fields in the sphere, r^ + z^ < a\^,
shown in Fig. 1-5-1, can be expressed as a power series, involving
Legendre polynominals.^^ For field calculations at any point, many
computer programs are available. A study by Watanabe^^ lists all the source
codes, so it is easy to use from the viewpoints of reproducibility and
modification. It can be used for solenoids as well as for racetrack and other
shapes.
When permanent magnets or ferromagnetic materials are present,
numerical calculations based on a finite element method are required. If a
commercial package is used for a calculation, understanding its accuracy
and limitations is very important. It is strongly recommended that
researchers confirm whether the calculation results make sense from a
physical point of view.
For general applications, B, grad B, and grad (B^l are important as
spatial distributions. The last term determines the magnetic force working

Fig. 1-5-2. It is noted that grad B and grad {B^)I2 become zero at the
magnet center, where the maximum B is obtained. The optimal shapes for
generating B, grad B, and grad {B^)I2 are slightly different even in a single
solenoid coil. Ordinary magnets are designed from the viewpoint of a high
^ or a uniform B.
By a combination of long solenoid coils and compensation coils, a
very uniform ^ in a limited space can be achieved. An NMR spectrometer
generates a very uniform B with an error component of about 1 ppb in a
sample volume. Temporal fluctuation also exists. The stability of a power
supply is in the range of 10"^ h"' to 10"^ h ^ The persistent mode of a
superconducting magnet, mentioned below, realizes a temporal stability of
less than 10-^ h-^
1.5.2 How to Generate High Magnetic Fields
A. Permanent Magnets
Permanent magnets are convenient when the required space is small or the
required field is low. They do not require auxiliaries such as power supply
or cooling system. As a sample can be positioned just on the surface of the
magnet, a large grad B and a large grad {B^)I2 are easily obtained. The
residual flux density of an Nd-Fe-B magnet is about 1.5 T. Using the
magnetic cylinder proposed by Halbach,"^^ fields of more than 3 T can be
obtained with rare-earth magnets. By modifying the Halbach cylinder, a
field of 5.16 T was achieved in a 2 mm gap.^^

--- Page 56 ---

36 1 Fundamentals of Magnetic Field Effects
A high-rc superconductor bulk can be used like a permanent magnet.
It requires a coolant or a refrigerator to maintain the superconducting state
and there must be a gap of a few millimeters to separate it from the sample
for thermal insulation. The maximum field, however, is very high. A
trapped field of 17.24 T was reported with a Y-Ba-Cu-O disk at 27 K.^>
B. Superconducting Magnets
Although a superconducting magnet requires liquid helium or a
refrigerator to maintain its superconducting state, it provides an
economical solution to generating high magnetic fields in a large space for
a long period of time. Once a very large magnet is installed, its energy
consumption is not particularly large. Superconducting magnets are
employed in MRI and fusion devices.
A superconducting magnet is composed of two kinds of superconductors,
with the exception of some demonstration magnets. For a magnet of less
than 10 T, NbTi conductors are mainly employed. For fields of more than
10 T, a combinafion of NbTi and NbsSn conductors is indispensable.
NbsSn conductors are three or more times expensive and more difficult to
handle than NbTi conductors due to their brittleness. The highest field of a
whole-body MRI magnet is 9.4 T at present. This value is mainly limited
by the performance of NbTi conductors, suggesting that the field of 10 T is
a very important threshold value for a superconducting magnet. By
combining NbTi and Nb3Sn conductors, fields up to 21.9 T have been
achieved.^^ As the critical field of NbiSn is about 25 T, the generation of
fields above 25 T requires other superconductors, such as high-Tc
superconductors. The highest field of superconducting magnets, 23.4 T,
was accomplished using NbTi, Nb3Sn and Bi-2212 conductors.^^ Increasing
the highest field will be possible mainly by developing and improving
superconductors.
A superconducting magnet is superior in field stability. In some
magnets, a switch made of a superconducting wire is connected in parallel.
When a magnet is being excited, the switch is heated to maintain the
normal state, and a power supply increases the current going through the
magnet. At the regulated current, the switch is cooled to the
superconducting state, and the current circulates in the superconducting
circuit including the magnet. This is called a persistent-mode operation. A
field decay rate of less than 10"^ h~' is realized in the persistent-mode
operafion of a well-designed and fabricated magnet, such as an NMR
magnet.
The improvements made to the cryocooler-cooled superconducting
magnet are remarkable. Fig. 1-5-3 shows a schematic cross section. This
magnet was realized by combining two technological inventions. One is
the development of a high-performance cryocooler, and the other is a
current lead made of high-Tc superconductors which possess both low

magnet is very suitable for magnetic processing because a long-term
operation can be performed without the need to refill coolants. A magnet
aiming at 19 T in a 52 mm room-temperature bore is now under
construction.^^
C. Resistive Magnets
In order to generate higher steady-state fields than those created with a
superconducting magnet, a resistive magnet is employed. This is made of
copper-alloy solenoid coils and operates in cooling water. Although several
kinds of coil windings have been proposed and fabricated, a Bitter coil,
named after its inventor, Francis Bitter, is commonly employed now. The
coil is made of Bitter plates, which have cooling holes for water and a slit
to pile them spirally with an electrical contact. A typical example of a
Bitter plate and an assembly of the coil are shown in Fig. 1-5-4.
The highest field achieved with a resistive magnet is 33.1 T in a 32-
mm room-temperature bore.^^ Compared with the superconducting magnet,
the resistive magnet is good at changing magnetic fields at a fast rate.
Since its current density is one order of magnitude larger than that of the
superconducting magnet, a large grad B and a large grad (B^)/2 are easily
obtained.
The disadvantage of a resistive magnet is its extremely large energy
consumption. The 33.1 T resistive magnet consumed 17.2 MW. The
consumption energy is changed to heat in the resistive magnet. Additional
energy is required to cool the magnet with water. For operating a high-field
resistive magnet, a large DC power supply and a large water-cooling
system must be installed. Only five facilities, the National High Magnetic

Field Laboratory (U.S.A.), the Grenoble High Magnetic Field Laboratory
(France), the High Field Magnet Laboratory (Netherlands), the Tsukuba
Magnet Laboratory (Japan) and the High Field Laboratory for
Superconducting Materials (Japan), provide resistive magnets for external
users.
D. Hybrid Magnets
A hybrid magnet consists of an outer superconducting magnet and an inner
resistive magnet. A schematic illustration of a hybrid magnet is shown in
Fig. 1-5-4. It is the most economical method for generating the highest
fields in a steady state. While a superconducting magnet is good at
generating magnetic fields in a large space with little energy consumption,
a resistive magnet is free from the critical fields of superconductors.
At present, the highest steady-state field of 45.2 T was achieved with
a hybrid magnet at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.'^^
Although the hybrid magnet is a very powerful system for the generation
of high magnetic fields, it possesses the disadvantages of the resistive
magnet and the superconducting magnet. Only three facilities, the National
High Magnetic Field Laboratory (45.2 T), the Tsukuba Magnet Laboratory
(37.9 T) and the High Field Laboratory for Superconducting Materials
(31.1 T), operate hybrid magnets for external researchers.

1.5 High-field Generation for Magnetic Processing 39
E. Pulsed Magnets
A pulsed magnet can generate much higher fields in a short period. A
nondestructive pulsed magnet is cooled with liquid nitrogen or water. By
discharging the energy in a capacitor bank to a magnet, high magnetic
fields are generated in a moment. A maximum field of 80.3 T with a pulse
duration of 8 ms has been reported.'^^ Using a large power supply system,
quasi-steady-state fields can be generated. A pulsed magnet, which could
generate a flat top field of 60 T in 100 ms, has been developed.^^^
Using the exploding single turn coil technique or the flux
compression technique, fields of more than 100 T can be generated. A coil
is broken after every field generation.
1.5.3 Some Issues Regarding Processing in High Magnetic Fields
Several kinds of interactions should be considered when processing in high
magnetic fields. Attention to the attractive force to ferromagnetic materials
is the most important. When materials with high electrical conductivity
move in magnetic fields, an eddy current occurs, causing heat generation
and a breaking force. The interaction between the currents and the
magnetic fields must also be considered in sample heating or measurement
wiring.
Almost no measurement apparatuses have been designed for use in
high magnetic fields. It is well known that the thermoelectric voltage of
thermocouples is significantly affected by magnetic fields at low
temperatures. Confirmation will be necessary to prove that the phenomena
used for the measurement method will not be affected.
1.5.4 Conclusions
Each magnetic processing may require unique spatial and temporal
distribution of the magnetic fields. Recent progress in magnet technology
makes this possible. However, some limitations might exist due to
economic, technological and theoretical difficulties. It is very important to
identify the type of magnetic field required for a specific kind of
processing.
Magnet technology, as well as magnetic processing, is progressing
rapidly. The latest results are presented at the International Conference on
Magnet Technology, which is held every other year. Selected papers
presented at the conference are published in IEEE Transactions on Applied
Superconductivity. Such information is helpful for understanding how to
achieve a required field with the available technology.

Effects of Magnetic Force
Magnetic force, or Faraday force, basically acts on all kinds of
magnetic materials, but it is very weak for diamagnetic
materials under ordinary fields near 1 T which are generated by
conventional magnets. This force is proportional to the so-
called magnetic force field B(3B/3z). As a consequence, using a
high magnetic field magnet above 15 T makes possible to
levitate diamagnetic materials in air against gravitational force.
In this chapter, MFEs based on magnetic forces are
described in relation to diamagnetic levitation, diamagnetic
separation, crystal growth in micro-gravity, micro-patterning,
reaction control, etc. where the magnetic forces are enhanced by
various methods to obtain useful MFEs.
2.1 Magnetic Levitation of Diamagnetic Materials
2.1.1 What is Magnetic Levitation?
Diamagnetic materials receive a repulsive force in a magnetic field
gradient. This force is too small to be observed under magnetic fields of
~1 T generated by a conventional electromagnet or a permanent magnet.
Recent developments in magnet technology allow the use of a
superconducting magnet without liquid helium or a stronger
electromagnet. A hybrid magnet, which consists of an inner water-cooled
magnet and an outer superconducting magnet, can generate magnetic fields
of up to 30-45 T. If diamagnetic materials are placed in such a hybrid
magnet, the magnetic force rises and counterbalances gravity, leading to
levitation of the materials.*^
When a diamagnetic material is placed in the vertical bore of a
solenoidal electromagnet, the magnetic force per unit mass of the material
in the vertical direction Fm is given by
/vn=(l/)Uo);t:gWi5/dz) (1)
where Xs is the magnetic susceptibility per unit mass, jUo the vacuum
permeability and B the magnetic flux density. The diamagnetic material

--- Page 62 ---

42 2 Effects of Magnetic Force
has negative susceptibility, so it receives an upward repulsive force if it is
placed above the center of the magnet. Magnetic levitation can be realized
when Fm = g, where g is the gravity constant. To levitate a water droplet,
the magnetic force field |5(d5/dz)| = 1360 T*^ m"' is required. Since a
usual superconducting magnet with the maximum field of 10 T can
produce magnetic force fields of up to -400 T^ m~\ a hybrid magnet must
be used for the levitation of water and other diamagnetic materials.
The first levitation experiment for various diamagnetic solids and
liquids, water, wood, organic polymers, etc. was conducted by Beaugnon
and Toumier using a hybrid magnet at the high magnetic field laboratory in
Grenoble, France.'^ This was followed by several levitation experiments
for many materials and living animals in other high magnetic field
laboratories throughout the world,^"^^ and applications to materials
synthesis have been attempted at the high magnetic field laboratory in
Sendai, Japan.^'^^
The counterbalance between the magnetic force and gravity holds for
each molecule constituting the materials. It is hence noteworthy that
magnetic levitation gives rise to a quasi-microgravity condition, allowing
some similar experiments in a space shuttle. Strictly speaking, however,
the state of magnetic levitation is not equivalent to microgravity in space.
While no stable potential minimum exists in space, the magnetically
levitating materials lie in a "valley" of potential energy. Moreover, strong
magnetic fields induce other magnetic field effects on the levitating
materials, e.g., magnetic orientation, dipole-dipole interaction, magnetic
convection, etc. For applications to materials synthesis, it is important to
understand the behavior of diamagnetic materials under levitation
conditions. This is described in section 2.1.3. One of the advantages of the
microgravity state is the repression of thermal convection that is
responsible for the quality of crystals. Section 2.1.4 is devoted to a
description of the thermal convection behavior in water under magnetic
levitation.
Magnetic levitation enables many novel techniques in materials
synthesis, one of which is containerless crystal growth. A containerless
technique provides a clean environment free from contamination from a
container. Heterogeneous nucleation is suppressed in the containerless
condition, so the liquid can easily be supercooled or supersaturated.
Sections 2.1.5 and 2.1.6 describe the application of magnetic levitation to
crystal growth.
Containerless technique has been applied to melt growth of levitating
materials. Melting of levitating glasses was carried out without a crucible
by using a hybrid magnet and a CO2 laser. This involves the use of what is
called a "magnetic levitation furnace." ^^ The development of the levitation
furnace and the thermal behavior of the levitating materials are discussed
in sections 2.1.7 and 2.1.8.

2.1 Magnetic Levitation of Diamagnetic Materials 43
2.1.2 Experiments on Magnetic Levitation
The levitation of diamagnetic materials requires strong magnetic force
fields |j5(d5/dz)| > 10001 T^m"'. For levitation experiments, a hybrid
magnet or a high-gradient superconducting magnet is indispensable. The
magnetic field profiles and levitating conditions depend on the
electromagnets used in the experiments. Here the authors discuss
experimental procedures using a hybrid magnet at the high magnetic field
laboratory in Sendai, where many kinds of levitation experiments have
been conducted.^"^' ^^^ The hybrid magnet used in the levitation experiments
consists of an inner water-cooled Bitter magnet and an outer
superconducting magnet. This magnet can generate a maximum field of up
to 28 T at the magnet center and a maximum force field of | B{dB/dz) I ~
3000 T^ m~^ in a 52-mm room-temperature bore.
A stable levitation condition can be obtained by considering the
potential energy of the material in the hybrid magnet. As an example, the
levitation condition of a water droplet is described.^^ When the droplet is
placed in a magnetic flux density B at distance z from the center of the
magnet along the vertical axial direction, the potential energy per unit mass
of water U is given as
U = -(\/2^o)XsB'-^gz + C (2)
where Xg is the magnetic susceptibility of water (-9.07 xlO"^ m^ kg'^ at
20°C),^^^ and C a constant. Fig. 2-l-l(a) shows the potential energy curve
as a function of z when the hybrid magnet generates 17.9 T at the magnet
center (z = 0). The curve has a minimum at z = 76 mm, where water can be
levitated. This position is slightly lower than the upper edge of the water-

cooled magnet. Fig. 2-1-1(b) shows the potential curve at z = 76 mm as a
function of the distance r from the center along the horizontal direction.
The curve has a minimum at the horizontal center (r = 0), and thereby
stable levitation is realized without any contact with the wall. The position
for the stable levitation is determined by the profile of the magnetic field in
the magnet bore, hence it is independent of the magnetic susceptibility of
the levitating samples.
The behavior of levitating samples is observed by a simple optical
system, which allows a side view in a confined space of the magnet bore.
The system consists of an electroluminescence device as the light source, a
prism and a small CCD camera, which displays fine images even in a
strong magnetic field of 20 T. The temperature within the magnet bore can
be controlled from -10°C to 50°C by the circulation of a thermoregulated
antifreezing liquid.
2.1.3 Alignment and Orientation of Levitation Materials
It is difficult to control levitating materials under contacdess conditions. In
microgravity of space, even weak forces such as wetness, which are
usually negligible under the gravity condition, have strong effects on the
behavior of materials. This is also the case under the magnetic levitation
condition. While no stable potential minimum exists for the materials in
space, the magnetically levitating materials lie in a valley of the potential
energy. Whether weak forces affect the behavior of these materials or not
thus depends on both the depth and width of the potential valley. The
levitating materials are expected to exhibit characteristic behavior different
from those under usual conditions, and the study of this behavior is
significant for the development of new material processing techniques.
Figure 2-1-2(a) shows the magnetic levitation of bismuth particles in
an optical cell placed in a hybrid magnet with the magnetic flux density at
the magnet center ^c = 11.7 T."^ The levitating particles align vertically
around z = 75 mm. Fig. 2-1-2 (b) shows the magnetic levitation of bismuth
particles at Be = 12.2 T. The particles align horizontally around z = 82 mm,
and it is noteworthy that they repel each other. Fig. 2-1-2(c) and (d) show
the contours of the potential energy around the levitating positions in Figs.
2-1-2(a) and (b), respectively. At Be = 12.2 T, the potential valley lies
horizontally around z = 80 - 82 mm (Fig. 2-1-2(d)). As a result, the
levitating particles align horizontally along the potential valley as shown in
Fig. 2-l-2(b). These particles then repel each other, because the
diamagnetic moments in all of these particles are in the same direction. On
the other hand, at ^c = 117 T, the potential energy has a local minimum
around z = 75 mm, r = 0, as shown in Fig. 2-1-2(c). The shape of the
potential energy most likely causes aggregation of the levitating particles
in the local minimum. Nevertheless, the bismuth particles align vertically
along the z axis as shown in Fig. 2-1-2(a). This indicates that the attractive

force among the diamagnetic moments in the particles causes the vertical
alignment.
It is possible to apply the effect of the potential energy valley to the
orientation of a levitating material, which has no anisotropy in magnetic
susceptibility but has shape anisotropy such as a rotational ellipsoid.'^^ Fig.
2-1-3(a) shows the levitation of two grains of rice in the hybrid magnet at
^c = 17.8 T. The rice grains levitate vertically around z = 76 mm. On the
other hand, they levitate horizontally at z = 79 mm with Be = 18.0 T, as
shown in Fig. 2-1-3(b).
When a diamagnetic material without anisotropy in magnetic
susceptibility is placed in a homogeneous magnetic field, the magnetic
orientation depends on the shape anisotropy. For the case of a rotational
ellipsoid, the long axis is liable to be oriented parallel to the magnetic
field.^^^ Under the magnetic levitation condition, however, the field is
highly gradient, and the orientation also depends on the potential energy
curve of the material. The calculated shape of the potential energy
minimum at z = 76 mm may preferentially cause the horizontal orientation,
as shown in Fig.2-l-2(c). Nevertheless, the orientation of the rice grains is
vertical, i.e., parallel to the magnetic field, as shown in Fig. 2-1-3(a). The

T.
shape anisotropy is thus responsible for such vertical orientation. On the
other hand, the horizontal valley of the potential energy exists at around
80 mm, and this horizontal valley is responsible for the horizontal
orientation of the rice grains in Fig. 2-1-3(b).
These results demonstrate that the magnetic levitation allows control
of alignment and orientation of diamagnetic materials even under a
contactless condition.
2.1.4 Thermal Convection in Water under Levitation Conditions
Control of thermal convection is one of the most important factors for
materials synthesis. The strong gradient magnetic fields causing magnetic
levitation provide a quasi-microgravity condition and are thus expected to
suppress thermal convection. To examine this, the heat transfer behavior in
water was investigated in the hybrid magnet.^"^^
Water is put into a plastic optical cell whose thickness is adjusted to
3 mm by inserting a spacer. A heater is placed horizontally in the middle of
the fluid. The sample cell is placed in the magnet bore, and the position of
the heater is adjusted to z = 76 mm. The behavior of heat transfer in water
is visualized by a liquid-crystal sheet fixed on a spacer; the sheet changes
color from black to green only in the temperature range of 35-40°C or
40-45°C.
Figure 2-1-4 shows the heat transfer behaviors in water under the
magnetic levitation condition B(dB/dz) = -1360 T' m' (Fig. 2-1-4(a)) and
a stronger force field B(dB/dz) = -2880 T' m'^ (Fig. 2-1-4(b) and (c)). In
the absence of a magnetic field, thermal convection rises above the heater,
and no convection appears below the heater. This is expected from the
density decrease and the buoyancy for the hot water. In contrast, no clear
convection is seen around the heater under magnetic levitation conditions,
as shown in Fig. 2-1-4(a). This result demonstrates that thermal convection

Fig. 2-1-4 Heat transfer in water (a) under a magnetic levitation condition B(dB/dz) = -1360 T' m"' in

is significantly suppressed under levitation conditions, as expected under
microgravity conditions. However, the heat transfer behavior is
asymmetric on the upside and the downside. Slight convection seems to
remain above the heater.
When hot water with temperature t2 is surrounded by cold water with
temperature t\, the total force is written as
F = (\/fio){xAt2)-xAti)]B{dB/dz)-{pit2)-pM}8 (t2>tO (3)
where x^it) and p(t) are the magnetic susceptibility per unit volume and the
density of water at temperature r, respectively. The first term is the
magnetic force and the second term is the gravitational buoyancy. When F
= 0, the buoyancy is cancelled out by the magnetic force, and the thermal
convection is expected to disappear. If Xg is independent of temperature,
the magnetic levitation conditions provide the F = 0 state because xM) =
Xspit) and {l/iJ.o)XgB(dB/dz) = g. Being different from usual diamagnetic
materials, \xg(0\ of water increases with increasing temperature.'^^ From
the values of p(0 and x^iO^ the values of I B(dB/dz) I were estimated for the
F = 0 state, assuming that the temperature difference tj-ti was 1°C. The
estimated values are 2000 - 3000 T' m"' for the temperatures 30 - 40°C,
being much larger than that under the levitation condition (1360 T^ m"').'^^
This means that the thermal convection remains under magnetic levitation
conditions. Hence, the asymmetric heat transfer in Fig. 2-1-4(a) comes
from the residual thermal convection above the heater.
Under the stronger magnetic force field B{dB/dz) = -2880 T^ m'* at
temperatures 35-40°C (Fig. 2-1-4(b)), symmetric heat transfer occurs on
both sides of the heater, and the thermal convection disappears. In this
case, the heat transfer is controlled by the thermal conduction of water, as
likely observed under microgravity conditions.
The values of \B(dB/dz)\ for F = 0 decrease gradually with
increasing temperature.'^^ Fig. 2-1-4(c) shows the result in the higher
temperature range 40-45°C under the same force field B(dB/dz) =

--- Page 68 ---

48 2 Effects of Magnetic Force
-2880 T^ m"'. Downward convection is seen below the heater, indicating
that the magnetic force predominates the buoyancy in this condition.
Similar magnetic convection has been observed in a paramagnetic fluid, ^"^^
where the temperature dependence of ;fg (the Curie law ;^g°^r') results in
dominant effects of the magnetic force on the thermal behavior of the
fluid. In the present case, it is surprising that the magnetic convection can
be observed even in diamagnetic water.
2.1.5 Solidification of a Levitating Water Droplet
Levitating crystal growth in magnetic fields may be a fascinating
technique for synthesis of diamagnetic materials. As a first attempt, the
solidification of a levitating water droplet was conducted.^^ Fig. 2-1-5(a)
shows a levitating water droplet as large as --6 mm in diameter at 0°C in
the hybrid magnet with Be = 17.9 T. Decreasing temperature at a rate of
approximately -0.3°C min', a supercooled liquid state survives down to
-10°C, then the droplet abruptly becomes opaque, as shown in Fig. 2-1-
5(b). Taking account of the latent heat of water freezing 79.7 kcal kg' and
the present supercooling temperature -10°C, it should be noted that the
whole droplet cannot be frozen. An opaque ice shell is formed whose
quantity is estimated to be approximately 12 wt% of the droplet, assuming
Fig. 2-1-5 Solidification process of a levitating water droplet in the hybrid magnet at Be = 17.9 T: (a)
before freezing at 0°C; (b) the initial stage of the solidification, forming an opaque ice shell
at -10°C; (c) appearance of inner water from the top of the shell (arrow); (d) generation of
bubbles of dissolved air, moving downward (arrow).

--- Page 69 ---

2.1 Magnetic Levitation of Diamagnetic Materials 49
the adiabatic condition that the thermal transport from the water surface to
the atmosphere is neghgibly small during formation of the ice shell (less
than 1 sec). The freezing part penetrates to the inside with lapse of time,
and the volume increase of freezing inner water breaks the top of the shell
(see arrow in Fig. 2-1-5(c)). The water comes out of the shell then freezes.
Repeating the process makes the droplet egg-shaped. Simultaneously, the
solidification generates bubbles of dissolved air, and they move downward
noticeably(see arrow in Fig. 2-1-5(d)).
The observed novel features in this experiment are attributed to two
factors in magnetic levitation. The first is the containerless condition,
which suppresses nucleation of crystals and stabilizes the supercooled
liquid state. Solidification begins abruptly, forming the ice shell
instantaneously. But the containerless adiabatic condition decelerates the
following solidification because there exists no transferring pass of the
freezing latent heat.
The second factor is the magnetic field gradient in which
paramagnetic oxygen is subject to the attractive magnetic force toward the
center of the magnet. In the levitating water no buoyancy acts on the
bubbles of air, hence the magnetic force makes them move downward.
Another effect of the magnetic field gradient is found in Fig. 2-1-5(c). The
place at which the inner water comes out of the globule is the top of the
shell. This is partly due to the influence of slight contact with the glass
capillary at the bottom of the globule and partly due to the difference in the
magnetic force between water and ice. The magnetic susceptibilities of
water and ice at 0°C are -9.04x10' and -8.82x10-' m' kg'*,
respectively, ^^^ hence the upward magnetic force acting on water is larger
than that on ice. As a result, the inner water comes out of the top.
2.1.6 Solution Crystal Growth
As the next application, crystal growth from a solution was conducted
under magnetic levitation conditions.^' Fig. 2-1-6(a) shows the crystal
growth of NH4CI in a levitating solution droplet (7 mm diameter) placed in
the hybrid magnet with 5c =18.1 T. The temperature is decreased from
25°C through the saturation temperature (12°C) down to 4.8°C at a rate of
-0.3°C min-\ The supersaturated state survives down to 4.8°C, then a
small cross-shaped nucleus appears at a certain place in the upper
hemisphere. It moves downward to the bottom of the droplet and grows
into a dendrite. The dendritic growth appears to be two-dimensional along
the surface of the droplet.
This result shows two characteristics of containerless crystal growth,
nucleation and growth direction. In the case of crystal growth in a
container, heterogeneous nucleation is induced by container walls, and it is
uncontrollable. The above result demonstrates that containerless crystal
growth under the magnetic levitation condition eliminates such

magnet at 5c = 18.1 T: (b) Crystal growth of NH4CI around the top of the droplet placed on

heterogeneous nucleation and reduces the number of growing crystals in
the solution. On the other hand, the droplet surface considerably affects the
growth direction of the crystal. Once the crystal sediments to the bottom of
the droplet, the dendrite grows along the surface. This is due partly to the
evaporation of the water and partly to the peculiarity of the liquid-gas
interface, suggesting that mass transport at the interface is much larger
than that in bulk solution.
Figure 2-1-6(b) shows NH4CI crystal growth in a solution droplet
placed on a glass dish in the hybrid magnet with Be = 20 T, where wetness
forces the droplet to keep in contact with the dish surface. It is found that
the dendrites grow at the top of the droplet. This is in contrast to the
bottom growth in the levitating droplet at i5c= 18.1 T.
Taking account of the magnetic force, gravity and buoyancy, the
force Fcrys acting on the unit volume of the crystal is given as
/Vrys = -(1 / //o )(;|:crys " jfsol )B{dB / d-) + (Pcrys " psol )g (4)
where x is the magnetic susceptibility per the unit volume (;tcrys= -13.2 x
10^ and Xso\ = -10.2 x 10"^) and p is density (pcrys= 1.53 x 10^ and psoi =
1.13 X 10^ kg m"^). The subscripts "crys'' and "sol" represent the crystal
and the solution, respectively. The force Fcrys is composed of the magnetic
and gravitational terms. The former is an upward force, and the latter is a

downward one. When the solution is levitating, the gravitational term is
larger than the magnetic term, so the crystal sediments to the bottom, as
shown in Fig. 2-1-6(a). With increasing magnetic field, the magnetic term
predominates the gravitational one, then the crystal floats on the solution,
as shown in Fig. 2-1-6(b).
Here it is worth considering the particular state Fcrys = 0. Balancing
the magnetic and gravitational terms means that the crystal neither
sediments to the bottom nor floats on the solution, implying that the crystal
is "levitating" in the solution. Even in the case of solution crystal growth
in a container, this allows wall-contact-free crystal growth. Such an
experiment was conducted as follows.
The NH4CI aqueous solution was saturated at 20°C (27.1 wt%), using
a quartz cell (10 x 10 x 30 mm^) as the container. To realize the Fcrys = 0
state at the position z = 76 mm, the hybrid magnet is required to generate
Be = 19.1 T. A seed crystal is put into the solution, and the temperature kept
at 22°C. The seed crystal stays at the bottom of the cell below Bc= 19 T.
When the magnetic field reaches Bc= 19.1 T, the seed crystal moves to the
horizontal center, where the horizontal potential energy is minimum, and it
levitates at z = 76 mm in the solution. Decreasing temperature from 22°C
to 17°C, a dendrite develops from the levitating seed without contact with
the wall, as shown in Fig. 2-1-6(c). This result demonstrates that the
magnetic force allows control of the crystal position in the solution,
leading to the novel technique of wall-contact-free crystal growth.
2.1.7 Magnetic Levitation Furnace
Containerless melting is one of the most practical and useful applications
of magnetic levitation. The advantages of containerless melting are (i) a
clean process free of contamination by the container, (ii) the easy
production of a supercooling state due to the repression of heterogeneous
nucleation and (iii) the capability of reaching temperatures higher than the
melting point of a crucible. Furthermore, in the case of the magnetic
levitation furnace, high magnetic fields are expected to cause orientation of
materials with anisotropic magnetic susceptibility.
The design of a magnetic levitation furnace requires several specific
features which are not seen in usual furnaces. The first requirement is the
heating of samples in high magnetic fields. Because the furnace is placed
in a hybrid magnet generating fields of up to 30 T, it must be able to
operate satisfactorily in such an environment. The second is the installation
of the furnace in a confined narrow space in the hybrid magnet, which
usually has a 52- or 32-mm bore. The third is the capability to be able to
observe the sample in the furnace to check that it actually levitates in the
heating and cooling processes. If the magnetic susceptibility of the sample
changes at melting or solidification, the sample falls or flies away.
The CO2 laser furnace is one of the heating methods satisfying the

--- Page 72 ---

52 2 Effects of Magnetic Force
above requirements. The laser beam is not affected by magnetic fields, and
local irradiation on just the sample allows the use of a CCD camera near
the sample. A horizontal laser beam from a CO2 laser is reflected by a
concave mirror and focused on a sample levitating in a sample cell.
The first experiment conducted with this furnace was the
containerless melting of BK7 glass.^' A glass cube changed shape into a
perfect sphere after melting and solidification. Marangoni convection was
observed in a melting droplet of paraffin.'^' When a paraffin cube
containing a few carbon particles was levitated and melted, the vertical
flow of carbon particles along the droplet surface was observed.
Microgravity environments including magnetic levitation make it possible
to ignore buoyant convection. The local heating from the upper side of the
sample induces the inhomogeneity in the surface tension of the droplet,
causing the Marangoni convection on the free interface.
The appearance of the Marangoni convection demonstrates that
magnetic levitation provides a quasi-microgravity condition. However, it
reduces the effects of magnetic orientation, which is useful for the
synthesis of functional materials. In order to solve this problem, a
homogeneous heating furnace with a YAG laser was designed.'^^ The laser
beam is guided to the top of the furnace through a laser fiber and shaped
into a ring by a cone mirror. The beam is then reflected by a concave ring
mirror and focused on the levitating sample at the radial center of the
furnace. The sample is thereby irradiated homogeneously by the radial
beam when the sample size is smaller than the beam width of 5 mm.
The experiment of paraffin melting was performed with the YAG
laser furnace, and the result is shown in Fig. 2-1-7.'^^ A paraffin cube is
levitating in the hybrid magnet bore with ^c= 15.6 T (Fig. 2-1-7(a)), and it
is melted by laser irradiation (Fig. 2-1-7(b)). A slight flow of carbon
remains in the melting droplet, but the flow rate is approximately 1/10 that
in the CO2 laser furnace. The homogeneous irradiation in the YAG laser
furnace considerably reduces the Marangoni convection. Simultaneously,
the reduction of the convection results in the magnetic orientation of the
paraffin. The levitating droplet falls during the solidification process, as
shown in Fig. 2-1-7(c), even though the applied magnetic field is kept
constant. This indicates that the magnetic susceptibility along the magnetic
field decreases due to the magnetic orientation of the paraffin molecules.
The orientation was confirmed by measurements of magnetic susceptibility
and X-ray diffraction.
The anisotropy in the magnetic susceptibility of the falling sample t^x
= X^- Xii was evaluated to be -0.095 x 10"^ m^ kg"', where Xn and x^ are
the magnetic suscepfibility parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic
field, respectively. This value is consistent with the estimate taking into
account the magnefic orientaUon of a single C-C bond in the paraffin
molecule.'^^ In contrast, falling of the sample was not observed in the case

of the CO2 laser furnace. Hence, homogeneous heating in the magnetic
levitation furnace reduces the convection, producing a spherical sample
with magnetic orientation. In addition, it is noted that the magnetic
levitation condition is quite sensitive to change in the magnetic
susceptibility.
2.1.8 Thermal Behavior of Levitating Materials
For practical use of the magnetic levitation furnace, it is necessary to
understand the thermal behavior of diamagnetic materials under magnetic
levitation conditions. It is known that the temperature dependence of
magnetic susceptibility of diamagnetic materials is very small. A slight
change in the susceptibility, however, affects the sample position in the
magnetic levitation. In the experiment of paraffin melting in the magnetic
levitation furnace, the sample moved upward by approximately 1 mm upon
laser irradiation.^^^ This means that Ixgl of the paraffin increases with
increasing temperature. From the potential energy profile, a change of I Xg I
can be estimated to be 0.5% for the 1-mm upward movement. If the
increase of Ixgl is larger than -10% and the sample moves upward more
than 5 mm, the sample loses the horizontal stable position (see Fig. 2-1-
2(d)), then moves to the wall. In order to keep such a sample at the

--- Page 74 ---

54 2 Effects of Magnetic Force
horizontal center, the magnetic field must be adjusted throughout the
heating process.
If a levitating sample is heated inhomogeneously and thermal
conductivity of the sample is very small, the levitating behavior is
complicated. An example is the motion of a piece of polymethylmethacrylate
(PMMA) in the magnetic levitation furnace with a CO2 laser. PMMA is a
clear plastic used for optic fibers. When the laser was switched on, the
levitating sample began to rotate in the horizontal plane. The period of
rotation was about 1-2 s, depending on the laser power. When the laser
was switched off, the rotation gradually slowed down and finally stopped.
When the laser was switched on again, the sample started to rotate again.
The origin of the rotational motion is considered to be the
inhomogeneous heating of the sample. When part of the sample is
irradiated by an off-center laser beam, the increase of I Xg I in the heated
part causes the magnetic force to act toward the horizontal center because
the magnetic field is minimum at the horizontal center at the given height.
However, the other part tends to stay on the equipotential surface in a
concentric circular shape. Consequently, a torque acts on the sample,
leading to the rotational motion. The rotational mode depends on the
manner of irradiation. Actually, rotation around a horizontal axis was
observed in another irradiation. In these thermal motions, the thermal
energy given off by laser irradiation is transformed into the magnetic
potential energy through the increase of I Xg L then transformed into kinetic
energy as a relaxation process.

2,2 Magneto-Archimedes Effects and Related Effects
The possible application of magnetic fields to the processing of feeble
magnetic materials has recently attracted much attention. The use of
magnetic fields is characteristic for its non-contact manner, i.e., magnetic
fields can have an effect on materials processing without any direct contact
with the matter. Types of influence include the control of gravitational
force and positions, convections, and magnetic orientations, among others.
These are explained in terms of the magnetic energy or magnetic forces.
The magnetic energy on a unit volume of a substance is expressed as
where ^o is the permeability of vacuum, x is the volume magnetic
susceptibility, and B is the magnetic flux density. The magnetic force per
unit volume is written as follows with the function of JC, the position of the
substance in magnetic fields:
F = ^ B^ (2)
jlo dx
When an electric coil is used to produce the magnetic field, the field takes
its maximum at the center of the coil and attenuates gradually with
distance from the center; on the other hand, the magnetic force is not
exerted at the center while it works at off-center positions. The most
striking field effect of gravitational force control was the diamagnetic
levitation made by Beaugnon and Toumier. ^^ Moreover, the morphological
relationships among different phases and even in a single phase may be
modified by the application of sufficiently high fields. Convection controls
have been made in fluids such as liquids^^ or gases.^^ The above equations
indicate that the field effect on feeble magnetic substances can be
intensified with the square of field strength B^ and that the use of a
superconducting magnet provides the means to boost the magnetic field
effect. Therefore, it is expected that various new processes of feeble
magnetic materials can be controlled by the use of magnetic fields. In this
section, several magnetic force effects on feeble magnetic materials and a
way to enhance them, i.e., the magneto-Archimedes technique, are
reviewed.

susceptibility. When a field of 10 T is applied in a horizontal superconducting
magnet, the surface of water is lowered at the center relative to the level at
the zero field regions, as shown in Fig. 2-2-1. In contrast, the surface of a
nearly saturated copper sulfate aqueous solution is raised at the center.
These effects are known as the "Moses effect" and the "reversed Moses
effect."
The surface or interface height difference of liquid between the
positions of X] and X2 was formulated as follows considering the
competition between the gravitational potential energy and the magnetic
energy:

respectively. The total height difference of the water surface was 39 mm
between the positions in the 10 T field and the zero field, as expected from
Eq. (3). To deform water or copper sulfate solution surfaces significantly,
high magnetic fields such as 10 T are required because of their small
magnetic susceptibihties. That is, the use of high magnetic fields was the
key to observing large deformation. However, under certain conditions, the
morphology of liquid can be deformed even by a permanent magnet, as
shown in Fig. 2-2-2. Here, the magnetic field at the center was 0.56 T. The
effect of the magnetic force was significantly enhanced by overlaying
another liquid of similar density on top of the initial one. This effect is
called the "enhanced Moses effect." It should be noted that the same height
difference as that shown in Fig. 2-2-1 has been observed under much lower
fields.
2.2.2 Diamagnetic Levitation and Magneto-Archimedes Levitation
Magnetic levitation of diamagnetic materials such as water or plastics was
first achieved by Beaugnon and Toumier.' ^ Diamagnetic levitation is based
on the balance in a magnetic force, created by a repulsive force from a
field and a gravitational force. The condition for levitation of a substance
of density p and volume magnetic susceptibility x is expressed as
.p^ + X^M^O (4)
where z is the vertical position.
This technique is attractive for use in the fields of material processing,
crystallization and microgravity research. However, diamagnetic levitation
needs an extraordinarily high magnetic field because the magnetic
susceptibility of the diamagnetic materials is very small. Even in the case of
water, which can be easily levitated due to its relatively low density and

--- Page 78 ---

58 2 Effects of Magnetic Force
large diamagnetic susceptibility, the required value of the product of the
field and its gradient, B • dBldz, must be as large as 1400 T^ m~\ while an
ordinary superconducting magnet with a field of 10 T and a room-
temperature bore of 100 mm0 can commonly achieve only about 400 T^
mr\ As a result, diamagnetic levitation requires a very large magnet.
Indeed, the first demonstration of diamagnetic levitation was performed
using a hybrid magnet with a field of over 20 T. There are very few
institutes with access to such a large magnet. Hence, it is difficult to apply
diamagnetic levitation for practical industrial processes.
There is another kind of magnetic levitation called "magneto-
Archimedes levitation".^^ By this technique, levitation can be achieved
easily by using a common superconducting magnet. Moreover, even
paramagnetic materials can be levitated by controlling the surroundings of
the object.
A stone becomes lighter in water than in air because buoyancy acts
on the stone, according to the Archimedes principle. Magneto-Archimedes
levitation applies this principle to levitation in a magnetic field. In this
case, the magnetic influence of the surroundings is taken into account. By
considering the contribution of the effect of the gas (or liquid) medium, the
condition for magneto-Archimedes levitation is expressed as follows:
-p,^ + ^ 5 |^ + p.^-^fi|^ = 0 (5)
HQ dz flo dz
where p\ and x\ are the density and susceptibility of the levitating
substance, respectively, and p2 and X2 are those of the gas (or liquid)
medium around it. In diamagnetic levitation, the latter two terms on the
left-hand side in Eq. (5) have been neglected. Under the field, if the
surroundings are sufficiently paramagnetic, the gas (or liquid) medium is
drawn towards the field center. If the force is directed downward, then the
effective weight of the surroundings will increase. If this occurs, the
requirements for levitation are lowered. For example, by using pressurized
oxygen gas of 10^ Pa as the medium, water can be levitated with an ordinal
10 T superconducting magnet in which B - dB/dz is about 400 T^ m~\ as
shown in Fig. 2-2-3 (a).
To demonstrate that the levitation is mainly due to the "magneto-
Archimedes" buoyant force, a paramagnetic water ball (x = +0.48 x 10^
in SI units) containing CUSO4 was levitated in 1.8 MPa oxygen gas. Fig. 2-
2-3 (b) shows a photograph of a blue ball of paramagnetic aqueous CUSO4
solution. It has been claimed that it is impossible to levitate a paramagnetic
substance stably because a position cannot be created in the free space
where the magnetic field is maximized according to one of the Maxwell
relations, divB = 0.^^ But in magneto-Archimedes levitation, the substance
floats horizontally at the position of the minimum field, the same position
as in diamagnetic levitation.

2.2.3 Magneto-Archimedes Separation
The stable levitation position in magneto-Archimedes levitation is
determined by the ratio of the difference of the magnetic susceptibilities to
that of the densities between the object material and its surroundings.
Therefore, different substances levitated in the field have different
equiUbrium positions. Even if some materials are levitated accidentally in
the same position under certain conditions, it is possible to change the
stable point and to separate the materials by changing the properties of the
surroundings. This appears to be a novel and useful way to separate
materials. The potential of this magneto-Archimedes separation was
evaluated through the following experiments.
Separation of colored glass particles in a solution of manganese
chloride was carried out to demonstrate the magneto-Archimedes
separation.^^ The glass is usually colored by doping with impurities.
Therefore, glasses of different colors should be different in density and in
magnetic susceptibility before undergoing magneto-Archimedes
separation. In our experiment, glass particles of four different colors, red,
blue, yellow and black, were used (Satake Glass Co., Ltd.). The densities
and magnetic susceptibilities were measured using a pycnometer and a
SQUID (Quantum Design, MPMS-5), respectively, and the following
results were obtained: red: x = -13.3 x 10 ^ p = 2.546 x 10^ kg m'\
yellow: x = -9.27 x 10"^, p = 3.208 x 10\ blue: x = -2.20 x 10"^, p =
3.171 X 10\ and black: ;t: = -h317 x 10"^, p = 3.199 x lOl Glass fragments
were passed through a sieve with 1 x 1 mm'^ mesh in advance, and the
smaller particles were used. Each of the glass particle aggregates of about
0.2 grams were put into a cylinder filled with a 6.0 wt% MnCb aqueous
solution (jf = +81.4 X 10"^, p = 1.052 x 10^), then put in an ultrasonic bath
for about one minute to eliminate air bubbles adhering onto the particle
surface. The cylinder was set so the bottom was at the maximum point of
IB ' dB/dz I. Increasing the field, the behavior of the colored glass particles
was observed.

[Reproduced from N. Hirota, RIKENRev., 44, 159(2002)]
Figure 2-2-4 shows photographs of magneto-Archimedes separation
of colored glass particles taken under several magnetic fields. At the
beginning, under zero magnetic field, all the colored glass particles are at
the bottom of the cylinder, as shown in Fig. 2-2-4(a). With increase in the
magnetic field, the glass particles gradually floated in the solution. When
the magnetic field in the center reached excess of 8 T, the red particles
floated (Fig. 2-2-4(b)). Then, the yellow and blue particles floated in
succession between 9.0 to 9.5 T (Fig. 2-2-4(c)). Even under 12 T, the black
glass particles did not levitate due to their large paramagnetic
susceptibility. The value of B - dB/dz needed to levitate red, yellow and
blue particles were 205, 298 and 325 T' m~', respectively. These values
were in good agreement with the calculated ones. Comparing Figs. 2-2-4
(c) and (d), the distance between the groups of different colored glass
differed, i.e., the distance was larger in Fig. 2-2-4(c) than in (d). This is
due to the difference in the spatial distribution of B • dB/dz. Around the
maximum point, B • dB/dz varies somewhat less than in the higher region in
the z direction. Thus the resolution of magneto-Archimedes separation
becomes high in this area.

--- Page 81 ---

2.2 Magneto-Archimedes Effects and Related Effects 61
In this experiment, the order of the required absolute value of B •
dB/dz corresponds to that of the magnetic susceptibilities. Judging from
this result, the equilibrium position is determined mainly by the magnetic
susceptibility in this case. In some other experiments, such as the
separation of a KCl and NaCl powder mixture,'^^ the equilibrium position
results mainly from the difference in density rather than in magnetic
susceptibility. In magneto-Archimedes separation, one can choose which
factor should be emphasized, the difference in magnetic susceptibility or
the difference in density, by selecting the appropriate surroundings.
The colored glasses used in the above experiment were made for arts
and crafts use. To add clear colors, they contained more impurities than
glass for practical use. This results in relatively large differences in
magnetic susceptibilities and densities among samples, making magneto-
Archimedes separation easy. It would be useful if glass for practical use,
such as bottles, tableware and glass windows, could be separated
according to differences in color by magneto-Archimedes separation,
because separation by color is required for recycling. We prepared several
kinds of glassware used in daily life to determine whether separation by
differences in color was possible by magneto-Archimedes separation.
Almost all the sample glasses used in this experiment have similar
densities. However, due to the slight difference in their magnetic
susceptibilities, it was confirmed that the separation of glass by color was
possible by magneto-Archimedes separation. Magneto-Archimedes
separation may be beneficial for materials recycling.
So far, differences in magnetic properties have not been utilized for
the separation of biological materials, but it is a potential application of
magneto-Archimedes separation. This possibility has been confirmed
experimentally.'^^ Biological materials used in the study were purified
hemoglobin, fibrinogen, albumin, cholesterol and deoxyribonucleic acid
(extracted from salmon sperm). Indeed, due to the slight differences in
magnetic susceptibilities and densities, they were separated by magneto-
Archimedes technique.
There are various magnetic separation techniques, such as a method
for picking out iron materials from metal scrap using a magnet, attraction
of tiny magnetic particles onto filter wires made of steel (HGMS: high
gradient magnetic separation) and others. These techniques are based on
whether the substance is attracted or non-attracted by magnetic forces. It is
therefore impossible to separate a mixture of several substances into each
component separately. One other conventional magnetic separation
method, gravity concentration, has been well known for decades, but this
separation method is controlled only by the density of solid materials.
Therefore, those with the same density cannot be separated.
The magnetic separation of feeble magnetic particles described here
can be readily achieved with the aid of the magneto-Archimedes principle

--- Page 82 ---

62 2 Effects of Magnetic Force
using an ordinary superconducting magnet. This separation technique
results from differences in density and magnetic susceptibility of the
materials and should enable one to separate a powder mixture composed of
more than one kind of substance quickly into separate clusters. This
method is sensitive to both the density and the magnetic susceptibility of
the materials. Magneto-Archimedes separation may be a useful method for
the separation of a wide range of materials and for recycling processes.
2.2.4 Magnetic Field Effects on Some Physicochemical Processes
Sometimes, unexpected effects are caused by magnetic force in some
physicochemical processes. In this section, such magnetic force effects on
physicochemical processes are introduced.
A. Magnetic Field Effect on Oxygen Dissolution Process in Water'^^
Gas dissolution into water and other liquids is an elemental step in
numerous processes. The oxygen dissolution process plays an important
role especially in the respiration of living bodies and in chemical and
metallurgical processes such as corrosion. Many studies have reported that
the concentration of dissolved oxygen in water is enriched by magnetic
fields.^^^ Most of them report an increment of the amount of dissolved
oxygen by up to 50% under less than 1 T of field. However,
thermodynamical considerations indicate that it is impossible to increase
the equilibrium amount of dissolved oxygen to such a high degree. The
calculated increment of the equilibrium oxygen concentration is 7 ppm in
the case of 1 T and 0.04% even under a high magnetic field of 8 T.
Therefore, it was a matter of interest for us to examine whether the
concentration of oxygen is in any way influenced under a magnetic field.
The experiments were carried out as follows. Seven cubic
centimeters of distilled water was introduced into the glass sample
container (diameter: 20 mm; length: 70 mm). Then the water was
degassed. The temperature around the sample space was regulated with
circulating water to 15.0 ± O.TC. The magnetic field was applied on the
sample container by a cryocooler-operated superconducting magnet with
an open room-temperature bore. The field homogeneity along the length of
the sample container (70 mm) was within 5.5%. Oxygen gas was then
introduced into the sample space at a pressure of 5 x 10*^ Pa.
After each prescribed duration of time, the water container was
disconnected from the system and the water was transferred into a small
test tube. An electrochemical oxygen sensor (TOA Electronics Ltd., Model
DO-25) was used to measure the dissolved oxygen concentration. The
change in the pressure of oxygen in the gas phase during the dissolution
was estimated to be below 0.2% considering the equilibrium amount of
oxygen dissolution into the sample water. Under the field distribution of
the superconducting magnet, the change in the surface area due to the

--- Page 83 ---

Moses effect was estimated to be about 0.03% for a field intensity of 4 T.
The zero-field experiment was performed following the exact same
procedure as described above except that the magnet was switched off.
First, it was examined whether or not the equilibrium value of
dissolved oxygen concentration in water was affected by the field. To attain
a sufficient equilibrium state, the sample water was exposed to oxygen for
12 hours under 0 T and 4 T The amount of oxygen dissolved under 0 T
was 21.44 g m"^ on average with a standard deviation of 0.70 g m"\ Under
4 T, it was 21.90 g m~^ on average with a standard deviation of 0.61 g m"\
The difference between the two sets of results was smaller than the
standard deviation, which was about 3%. Therefore, it can be concluded
that the equilibrium concentration of dissolved oxygen in water does not
differ by more than three percent when a field of 4 T is applied.
Next, the concentration of dissolved oxygen after one hour of
exposure of water to oxygen was measured. The amount of dissolved
oxygen was larger under 4 T than that under zero field. The average amount
of oxygen and the standard deviation were 12.89 g m'^ and 0.50 g m"^
under 0 T and 17.67 g m"^ and 0.41 g m'"^ under 4 T, respectively. The
observed enhancement by the field was as large as 37% under 4 T These
two observations after 12 hours and 1 hour of exposure time indicate that
the dissolution rate of oxygen into water was increased by the field.
To confirm the above indication of change in the oxygen dissolution
kinetics under different fields, the time dependence of the oxygen
dissolution into water was examined under 0, 2 and 4 T. Results are shown
in Fig. 2-2-5. It is noted that the final concentraUon nearly reaches the
same equilibrium value under every one of the three different fields.
However, in the shorter time range required to attain equilibrium described
herein, it was clear that the dissolution of oxygen was accelerated by the
presence of the magnetic fields. The above results show that the kinetics of
oxygen dissolution into water is enhanced significantly by the application
of magnefic fields, while the equilibrium of oxygen dissolution remains
unchanged under the fields.
Concerning the possible mechanism of the kinetic enhancement of
oxygen dissolution into water by magnetic fields, there are three essential
steps involved in the dissolution process.
(a) Supply of oxygen to the gas-water interface from the gas phase.
(b) Oxygen dissolution at the gas-water interface.
(c) Movement of dissolved oxygen molecules into the bulk of the water
phase.
First, pure oxygen gas was employed in the present experiment to
provide constant pressure during the dissolution process and hence, the gas
phase was dominantly oxygen, considering the equilibrium water vapor
pressure below 2 x 10^ Pa. Since the diffusion in the gas phase is quite
fast, there should not be any significant gradient of oxygen partial pressure

in the gas phase, which makes step (a) unlikely as the rate-determining
step.
To accelerate the dissolution reaction of oxygen at the water surface,
step (b), either the activation energy of the reaction should be reduced or
the frequency factor of the reaction should be raised by the magnetic field.
From the thermodynamic point of view, it is not likely that the activation
energy is altered by the fields because the magnetic energy given to
oxygen gas is sufficiently small, i.e., 0.27 J mol"' under 4 T.
If step (c) is the rate-determining step, the kinetics should depend on
the diffusion process of the oxygen molecule in water in the absence of
convection of the liquid phase. From the dissolution curve in Fig. 2-2-5,
the diffusion coefficient can be estimated assuming a diffusion-controlled
process from the water surface into the bulk and a constant surface
concentration of oxygen equal to the equilibrium value. The diffusion
coefficient of oxygen in water thus obtained was 7.17 x 10"^ m^ s~\ 14.2 x
10"^ m^ s-\ and 19.6 x 10"^ m^ s' under 0, 2 and 4 T, respectively,
corresponding to the reduction of the activation energy of diffusion by
1.64 kJ mol"^ and 2.41 kJ mor\ respectively. Such a large enhancement of
oxygen diffusion by the field seems to be unlikely due to the smallness of
the magnetic energy.
Another possibility in this category is the enhancement of oxygen
movement in water by the magnetically induced convection of water. In
the dissolution process, a gradient of oxygen concentration may be formed
in water, i.e., dissolved oxygen is denser near the water surface than
around the bottom of the glass vessel. This means that a gradient of
volume magnetic susceptibility is created in water due to the paramagnetic

--- Page 85 ---

2.2 Magneto-Archimedes Effects and Related Effects 65
nature of oxygen while water is diamagnetic. Under a non-uniform
magnetic field, the convection may be induced by the non-uniformity of
the magnetic force acting on the water. By such a magnetically induced
convection, water is stirred, and the oxygen dissolution is accelerated.
Actually, the space used in previous experiments around the magnetic field
center has 5.5% field inhomogeneity.
An analysis was made based on hydrodynamics analogous to thermal
convection. Water can be treated as an incompressible fluid, and the
equation of continuity then becomes
div(v) = 0 (6)
Then, the Navier-Stokes equation is written as follows,
p —- -H p(v • grad)v = -gradCp) + F + jiV^v (7)
ot
where p is the density of liquid, v the velocity of the flow, t time, p the
pressure of liquid, F the external force and // the coefficient of viscosity.
The gradient of oxygen concentration is formed in the vertical direction.
The distribution of the velocity of the z direction along the y axis should be
evaluated in this system. The external force is the difference in the
magnetic force between surface and bottom,
F = ^Bf (8)
jUo dz
where ^x is the difference in magnetic susceptibility between the surface
and bottom of the water phase. The upper end of this system is the free
water surface, and the lower end is the fixed end. Then, the boundary
condition is written as follows,
—f = 0 (upper end), v = 0 (lower end) (9)
^y
Following the analogy of thermal convection, we can obtain the velocity of
water in the z direction as follows.
Vz(r7) = {^B^]^{r)-\W^Ar)^\) (10)
where b is half the water depth and rj = y/b.
The velocity of the flow in water can be estimated using this
equation. We applied the value required to the estimation as follows: Ax =
3.3 X 10-^ B' dB/dz = 56 T' m-\ b = 5x 10"' m, M = 1.1383 x 10"' Pa • s,
r] = -1 (to estimate maximum velocity in the upper half), and rj = -1 + V2
(to estimate maximum velocity in the lower half). Obtained velocities were
10.8 mm s~^ for the upper half and -4.5 mm s~' for the lower half. These
values seem to be large enough to generate magnetically induced
convection and cause acceleration of oxygen dissolution.

--- Page 86 ---

66 2 Effects of Magnetic Force
According to this convection mechanism, the degree of acceleration
should depend on the amplitude of the product of the magnetic field and its
gradient, B • dB/dz, and the magnetic susceptibility of gas. These features
were confirmed experimentally.'^^ All the observations support the
mechanism that the acceleration of oxygen dissolution into water is caused
by magnetically induced convection due to the non-uniformity of magnetic
susceptibility and the magnetic field in water.
The observations above appear to have great significance. When
biological processes in nature are considered, the metabolism of living
creatures depends on oxygen dissolution into water. The above results
suggest that certain biological processes that are subjected to magnetic
fields in the range of a few to several teslas may be affected via a change
in the dissolution kinetics of oxygen into water. Moreover, since the
convection of liquid plays an important role in some chemical and
metallurgical processes, processes that include oxygen dissolution or
consumption should be affected by magnetic fields due to the magnetically
induced convection.
B. Magnetic Field Effect on Water Vaporization'^^
In the course of studies on microbial processes, faster drying of incubation
solutions under fields was sometimes noticed. In order to confirm the
observation quantitatively, a simplified experiment was designed to observe
the rate of vaporization of water precisely in the presence of fields. Under
flowing dry carrier gases, nitrogen, air and oxygen, on the water surface,
the water vaporization rate was monitored by a humidity sensor placed in
the outlet gas. First, no magnetic influence was observed in the case of
nitrogen, while significant field effect was observed for air and oxygen.
Examination of how the magnetic field is related to the enhancement
led us to propose the following mechanism, which is similar to the
mechanism of the magnetic field acceleration of oxygen dissolution into
water. The paramagnetic volume susceptibility of air, Xair = +0.3736 x 10"^,
is mainly contributed by oxygen gas, ;fo:= +1.8028 x 10"^, while nitrogen
and water vapors are both diamagnetic with much smaller contributions,
XN,= -0.0063 X 10-^ and ;fH:0 = -0.0068 x 10~^ at 293 K, 101 kPa. During
the vaporization process, a susceptibility gradient could be created along
the vertical direction in the atmosphere above the water surface. This is
because the water vapor content should be larger near the water surface
than at a distance if the diffusion process of water vapor in the atmosphere
is the rate-determining step of the vaporization. The saturated vapor
pressure of water, 2338 Pa, in air at 293 K reduces the susceptibility of the
air 2.35% less than the ;t'air of the dry air. The difference in the volume
magnetic force exerted on the wet air near the water surface and the dry air
in bulk would be 2.2 N m"\ This difference would be as large as the
driving force expected when thermal convection takes place between two

--- Page 87 ---

2.2 Magneto-Archimedes Effects and Related Effects 67
air regions of different temperatures, 293 and 293 + 50 K. Thus, a rather
strong magnetic convection induced by water vaporization should be
expected. This hypothesis was confirmed experimentally as reported
elsewhere. ^^^
As a consequence, when living organisms are placed under a
magnetic field with gradient, they may feel colder due to the latent heat of
vaporization, and they may experience aqueous environments with
different concentrations of ingredients from the intended values. These
changes in environmental conditions should necessarily cause some
change in the experimental results when living organisms are subjected to
the magnetic field for examination. Therefore, special consideration must
be taken when determining whether the field really has an effect on living
organisms.
C. Magnetic Field Control of Thermal Convection
On the basis of the preceding findings, we devised a wind tunnel that can
generate wind through a tube placed in a magnet but without any moving
mechanical parts in it.^^^ This is based on the following generalized
observations. The volume magnetic susceptibility of the heated air
decreases with T as 1/rl The neighboring colder air in the tube tends to
replace the heated air, pushing it out of the high field region in order to
maximize the total magnetization of the air, thereby minimizing the
magnetic energy. The procedure was based on the imbalance of the
magnetic force made by asymmetrical heating.
In the vertical direction, the heating air generates thermal convection,
i.e., an upward flow in the heater tube. By applying a high and steep
gradient magnetic field in such a system, it is possible to control the
thermal convection.'^^ Based on the above-mentioned mechanism, it seems
possible to accelerate the upward thermal convection by applying a field
below the heating region. On the other hand, reversal of the upward flow
may occur when a field is applied above the heating region. Indeed, it was
ascertained that a magnetic field is applicable for controlling thermal
convection. The use of the field can even reverse the direction of the
thermal convection of the air in a vertical furnace. The magnetically
induced airflow described in this section is fairly large in volume and has
no mechanically driven parts. Therefore, by using this technique, it is
possible to control thermal convection on an industrial scale.
2.2.5 Self-organization of Feeble Magnetic Materials by Magnetically
Induced Dipole Interactions
The magnetic field effects described above are mainly based on magnetic
forces, and magnetic forces can be expressed as interactions between
feeble magnetic substances and gradient fields. In contrast, interactions
among feeble magnetic substances under magnetic fields have been

--- Page 88 ---

68 2 Effects of Magnetic Force
neglected thus far. In ferromagnetic substances, interactions through their
magnetic dipoles can be observed clearly.'' '^^ On the other hand, in feeble
magnetic substances, magnetic dipoles are induced only under magnetic
fields, and their values are extremely small. Therefore, the energy of the
interactions becomes too small, and they are not usually observed.
However, through well-designed experiments using high fields of several
teslas, it was confirmed that such interactions can be observed visually
even in feeble magnetic substances.'^^ It is known that magnetic dipole
interactions lead dispersed particles to some ordered alignments. However,
only systems containing ferromagnetic substances have been considered so
far, and such applications have been restricted to a few materials. The
applications of this effect to systems of feeble magnetic substances would
make it possible to control structures of various materials, which would be
useful in material processing. In this section, the control of structures of
feeble magnetic substances by utilizing induced magnetic dipoles
interaction is introduced.'^^
First, alignments parallel to the fields were observed. The sample
particles used in this experiment were glass beads (~ 0.8 mm0), which are
diamagnetic and have volume magnetic susceptibility of-1.8 x 10"^
Manganese dichloride aqueous solution of 40 wt% was used as the
medium in consideration of the magneto-Archimedes effect. In this
experiment, the superconducting magnet was set horizontally. The glass
beads and MnCb aqueous solution were put in a glass cell, which was
inserted into the bore of the magnet. One of the cell edges was fixed at the
center of the field, and the glass beads initially gathered at that side. From
this configuration, magnetic fields were increased gradually. Then,
magnetic forces acted on the glass beads, and they moved to the other side
of the cell to avoid the higher field region. These processes were observed
from the bottom of the cell. One of the results of these experiments is
shown in Fig. 2-2-6. In this figure, the field was applied parallel to the
space, decreasing from right to left, and its intensity was around 2.5 T. As
seen in the figure, the glass beads aligned in chain-like formations parallel
to the applied field as they moved away from the center of the field. These
formations were derived from the attractive interactions among magnetic
dipoles induced in the glass beads.
Alignments perpendicular to fields were then observed. In this
experiment, the magnet was placed vertically and a Petri dish containing
the sample particles and surrounding medium was placed in its bore. The
particles used in this case were gold spheres 1.0 mm in diameter; 40 wt%
MnCl2 aqueous solution was used as the medium. The gold spheres were
positioned 149 mm above the field center, where the fields were only
slightly larger (-0.2%) at the wall side than at the middle of the bore. From
this configuration, field was applied and the two-dimensional alignments
of the spheres observed from above. To avoid the effect of friction between

from left to right, and its intensity was 2.5 T at the field center.

Fig. 2-2-7 Triangle-lattice alignments of gold balls in 40 wt% MnChaq. The direction of magnetic
field was perpendicular to this space, and its intensity was 4.9 T. The right figure is a close-
up view of the left one. The diameter of particles is 1.0 mm.

gold spheres and Petri dish, the field intensity was adjusted and the
apparent weights of the gold spheres were set to zero utilizing vertical
magnetic forces, i. e., magneto-Archimedes levitation was applied. Fig. 2-
2-7 shows the magneto-Archimedes levitation state of gold spheres
observed from above. The gold spheres gathered to the middle of the bore,
influenced by slight radial magnetic forces. However, the gathering
spheres were not closely packed and formed triangle-lattice alignments
with some spacing. This formation of the lattices was caused by the
repulsive interactions between each magnetic dipole induced in the gold
spheres. Alignments perpendicular to fields can be controlled by repulsive
interactions among induced magnetic dipoles.
As confirmed here, it was found that the formation of alignment was
attained even in systems consisting of only feeble magnetic materials.
Because magnetism is a property that all materials have, the knowledge
obtained here means that control of structures or self-organization will be
possible in a wide range of materials. Therefore, these phenomena suggest
new applications of magnetic fields to various fields such as materials
processing.

--- Page 90 ---

70 2 Effects of Magnetic Force
As demonstrated by the experiments described above, various new
processes can be controlled by the presence of magnetic fields. Since the
effects are proportional to the square of the field strength B^, making use of
a superconducting magnet is essential to boost the magnetic field effect.
Consequently, magnetic fields have a great potential to be applied to
materials processing in accordance with the future development of higher
field magnets or specially designed magnets for material processing of
feeble magnetic materials.

2.3 Formation of Protein Crystals under Microgravily on Earth 71
2.3 Formation of Protein Crystals under Microgravity on Earth
2.3.1 Why High Quality Protein Crystals Are Necessary
Proteins are the elementary building units of living creatures, and the
molecular structure of proteins provides the basis for understanding the
functions of biological macromolecules. Determining the structure of
protein molecules is therefore crucial. The most powerful technique for
determining protein structure is X-ray crystallography. However, the
production of crystals of adequate size and high quality is often the
"bottleneck" for three-dimensional structure analysis of macromolecular
crystals. The crystallization of biological macromolecules is an empirical
science of rational trial and error guided by previous studies, and the
development of general methods to improve crystal quality is essential. For
example, crystallization experiments conducted in space have indicated
that about 30% of crystals grown in space yield better X-ray diffraction
data than the best crystals grown on Earth.'^ An obvious difference
between space- and Earth-based experiments is the reduction of buoyancy-
driven convection and sedimentation of crystals.
Until recently, there were few methods to grow protein crystals in
microgravity outside the space station. The cost of space experiments is
expensive and the opportunity to experiment is limited. However, in 1996,
a new method to control effective gravity using a vertical magnetic force
was proposed.^ "^^ In the following section of this review, we summarize a
method and apparatus to control effective gravity ranging from
microgravity to hypergravity. Using the low gravity environments obtained
by this method, it is possible to damp buoyancy-driven convection even in
electrically low- and nonconducting fluids such as water, organic solvents,
typical protein aqueous solutions, etc.^*
For growing protein crystals, low gravity environments obtained by
the above method are considered to be the best candidates for substituting
or simulating the microgravity conditions in space.^'^^ In this review, we
describe the first formation of protein crystals in microgravity produced by
a superconducting magnet.^^ Finally, we discuss the future and potential of
microgravity environments obtained by this method.
2.3.2 A Method to Control Effective Gravity
Recently, a new method to control effective gravity has been invented.^'^^
Most materials, such as water and a majority of proteins, are diamagnetic
and experience a weak repulsive force along the steepest gradient of the
magnetic field. Generally, a unit volume of a substance in a one-
dimensional magnetic field gradient experiences a force Fm :

--- Page 92 ---

72 2 Effects of Magnetic Force
Fm =pi2oXgH(dH/dy) (1)
where p is density, /io(= 4;rx 10'^ H m~') is the absolute magnetic
permeabiUty of vacuum, Xg the magnetic susceptibility per unit weight, H
the magnetic field strength and y the site coordinate.
Because Fm is proportional to the material density, its superposition
on gravity can partially reduce or enhance the effective gravity (vertical
acceleration). When an upward Fm is applied along the gravitational force
Fg, the total force acting on a fluid inside a container is
F=F,-F^=p{g-\jUoX,H(dH/dy)\} = ppg (2)
This equation indicates that the level of effective gravity p can be
modified by changing the value of H(dH/dy). Most diamagnetic materials
have nearly the same negative Xg^ ^^^ Xg is independent of temperature.
Therefore, even for mixtures such as protein aqueous solutions, Eq. (2)
holds, and the effective gravity can be controlled approximately. Fig. 2-3-1
shows a cross-section schematic of the vertical superconducting magnet
which was used in the present study and the spatial distribution of the
magnetic strength along a vertical central v axis. When po^H{dH/dy) =
-1370 T^ m"' at position A, an upward Fm of pg acts on pure water (Xg =
-9.0 X 10"^ m^ kg'), thus a microgravity environment is expected. On the
other hand, when po^H{dH/dy) = 1100 T^ m"' at position C, a downward Fm
of 0.8 pg acts, and a hypergravity environment of 1.8 G (1 G = 9.8 m s'^) is
expected. At the center of the magnet (position B) where field strength is
15 T and its gradient is 0 T^ m"', Fm is zero and the gravity level is 1 G.

2.3 Formation of Protein Crystals under Microgravity on Earth 73
Until recently, a large magnetic field gradient of Ho^H(dH/dy) =
-1370 T^ m"^ could be provided for only several hours by a massive hybrid
magnet. However, since 2002, a convenient type of superconducting
magnet can generate such a large magnetic field gradient. Specifically, for
the formation of protein crystals, generating a microgravity environment
for a long time is crucial. A magnet such as the JASTEC LH15T40 of
Japan Superconductor Technology Inc.'^^ and the installation of a magnetic
booster to ordinary superconducting magnet ''^ can supply a microgravity
environment for more than several weeks.
Protein crystal formation experiments were conducted using the
former superconducting magnet that can generate environments of
microgravity (|iG) at position A, 1 G at position B and 1.8 G at position C,
simultaneously (see Fig. 2-3-1).^^ Magnetic field strength, H and H(dH/dy)
at each position, are shown in Fig. 2-3-1. The inner diameter of the bore
was 40 mm.
2.3.3 Experimental Procedure
Orthorhombic lysozyme crystals were obtained by the conventional batch
method. Hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL, Seikagaku Kogyo,
recrystallized six times) was used without further purification. A
supersaturated solution was prepared by mixing an equal volume of the
lysozyme and NaCl solutions to give a solution with a final concentration
of 60 mg mr^ HEWL and 40 mg ml' NaCl. The pH was controlled at 4.60
by adding 1 N HCl. The solution was then filtered through a filter of pore
size 0.22 jim. Immediately after the supersaturated solution was prepared,
it was separately injected into small vessels and placed both inside and
outside the magnet. As shown in Fig. 2-3-1, three positions were used (A:
|LiG/ll T, B: 1 G/15 T, C: 1.8 G/11 T) inside the magnet. Simultaneously,
samples were also placed outside the magnet (1 G/OT) as controls. The
temperature of the samples was controlled at 40.0 ± 0.1 °C in copper tubes
by flowing temperature-controlled water. The size of the vessels was
(|)6.5 mm x 16.5 mm. Solution volume in each vessel was 100 |LI1 and the
solution height was about 3 mm. The duration of the crystallization was
two days. After crystallization, the best-looking crystals of similar size
were chosen from different positions for analysis. X-ray diffraction data
were measured on a Bruker SMART6000 diffractometer with CuKa
radiation from a MAC Science MX06 rotating anode generator. The data
sets were processed with the programs SaintPlus (Bruker) and Madnes
(Nonius).
There are several parameters to indicate the quality of protein
crystals, such as the I/a value, overall ^-factor, mosaicity, /Emerge, rocking
curve, maximum resolution, etc. Some parameters are much affected by
crystal size and X-ray diffraction measurement conditions. In this study,
the crystal quality was compared using the overall 5-factor because it is

--- Page 94 ---

74 2 Effects of Magnetic Force
essentially independent of crystal size. Generally, the overall ^-factor is
not very sensitive to the crystal quality because thermal vibration mostly
contributes to this factor. Therefore, the change in overall i5-factor
corresponding to the improvement of crystal quality appears relatively
small.
2.3.4 Experimental Results and Discussion
Figure 2-3-2 shows the results of three experiments graphically, using the
overall ^-factor. The numbers in circles and triangles represent the number
of experimental runs. (Crystals were grown from the same mother solution
in the same experimental run.) From Fig. 2-3-2, crystal quality using
different comparison criteria can be ranked.
A. Comparison between Microgravity-grown Crystals and 1.8 G-grown
Crystals
Recently, the effects of strong magnetic fields on protein crystal quality
have been studied.^ ^ '^^ Currently, four mechanisms are known (see Table
2 in ref.^^), and all of them may contribute to the improvement of crystal
quality. Low-gravity environment is obtained by applying a magnetic field
gradient, while other mechanisms such as magnetic orientation of crystals,
damping of natural convection by Lorentz force, etc. work in both uniform
and gradient magnetic fields. The magnetic field strength (11 T) at
microgravity position (A) is the same as that of 1.8 G (C) (see Fig. 2-3-1).
Therefore, the comparison of crystals formed in microgravity and
hypergravity makes it possible to examine purely the dependence of
effective gravity on crystal quality. As shown in Fig. 2-3-2, in the three sets
of experimental results, the overall 5-factor of the crystals obtained at |iG

was always smaller than that of the crystal obtained at 1.8 G. Since lower
B-factor indicates better quality, this result indicates that the difference in
crystal quality comes from the difference in effective gravity, i.e., natural
convection.
In microgravity, natural convection is effectively damped, while it is
promoted at hypergravity. Previously, we showed experimentally and
theoretically that natural convection affects the crystal growth rate of
protein.^^'^'^^ Here the results clearly show that natural convection reduces
crystal quality. This agrees with the dependence of crystal quality of snake
muscle fluctose-l,6-bisphosphatase on the effective gravity from 0.7 G to
1.3 G.'^
B. 1 G-grown Crystals in the Presence and Absence of a Magnetic Field
(15 T)
At the center of the magnet (position B in Fig. 2-3-1), the field strength is
15 T and the gravity level is the same as outside, i.e., IG. Therefore,
comparing the crystal quality formed at position B with that outside the
magnet, we can study the effect of magnetic field strength on the crystal
quality. As shown in Fig. 2-3-2, the crystals obtained inside the magnet
(15 T) show better quality than those obtained outside. This result is in
agreement with the previous results on orthorhombic lysozyme crystals.^^^
On the other hand, for snake muscle fluctose-l,6-bisphosphatase,^^ the
improvement of crystal quality was not clear at the center of the magnet
(IG/IOT).
C. Comparison between Microgravity-grown Crystals (|LIG/11 T) and
Crystals Grown Outside the Magnet (1 G/0 T)
Compared with the crystals formed outside, the crystals obtained at the |LIG
position inside the magnet were affected by both the microgravity
environment and the magnetic field itself. Fig. 2-3-2 demonstrates that all
experimental data sets reproducibly show that the crystals obtained at the
|iG position exhibit better quality than those obtained at normal gravity
outside.
Thus, both microgravity and the magnetic field itself improve the
quality of the crystals effectively and reproducibly. Further verification of
the combined effects of microgravity and magnetic field itself will lead to
a more general means to grow high quality protein crystals.
Furthermore, it is notable that the magnet can provide an
environment ranging from microgravity to hypergravity. It is well known
that microgravity is not always effective for improving the crystal quality
of protein.'^ As described in section 2.3.4A, if crystals are grown in
microgravity (|LIG/11 T) and hypergravity (1.8 G/11 T) and their quality
compared, it is possible to determine whether or not microgravity is
effective for the improvement of crystal quality. For example, when we

--- Page 96 ---

76 2 Effects of Magnetic Force
applied this method to the formation of cubic porcine insulin and
tetragonal lysozyme crystals, dependence of crystal quality on effective
gravity was not observed. Thus, this kind of test will be useful in the
selection of promising proteins prior to experiments conducted in space.
Quality improvement of protein crystals is challenging work. Until
now, there were few general means available for improving crystal quality.
The current work on microgravity is one of many efforts being made to
achieve a more or less general means to grow high quality protein crystals.
At present, the cost of microgravity provided by a convenient type of
superconducting magnet is not very expensive. The procedure for using the
superconducting magnet is not difficult. We can use microgravity at any
time and obtain fresh protein crystals. For these reasons, we expect that the
microgravity produced by a superconducting magnet may act as a
powerful and widely applicable tool for growing high quality protein
crystals.
In conclusion, the use of both a microgravity environment and
magnetic field generated by a vibration-free, durable superconducting
magnet will provide an excellent environment for growing high quality
protein crystals. Further research is necessary to investigate the potential
applications of such microgravity on Earth.

2.4 Control of Thermal Convection Using Magnetic Field 77
2.4 Control of Thermal Convection Using Magnetic Field
Chemical, physical and biological phenomena are affected by Earth's
gravity. Gravity induces thermal convection and concentration-induced
convection. However, this simple fact is not well recognized in many
cases. By applying a magnetic force opposite to gravitational force,
apparent gravity can be reduced, whereas apparent gravity can be
strengthened by applying magnetic force in the same direction as gravity.
Therefore, it is interesting to learn how gravity-induced convection could
be controlled by applying a magnetic force.'^ In order to clarify the role of
vertical magnetic force on thermal convection, we have undertaken in situ
observations of the thermal convection of benzene solution in magnetic
fields. Organic photochemical reaction is used to heat the solution locally
and visualize the heated solution.
2.4.1 l,2.Dicyano-l,2-bis(2,4,5-trimethyl-3-thienyl)ethene(CMTE)^^
CMTE undergoes a photo-isomerization reaction upon laser irradiation and
its color changes from pale yellow to red due to the formation of photo-
isomers (PI).^^ The excess photon energy is used for local heating of the PI
solution. Therefore, the photoreaction of CMTE is convenient for local
heating of solution and visualizing the motion of the heated solution.
A quartz cell (10 mm x 10 mm x 40 mm) was placed in a room-
temperature bore tube of a superconducting magnet (JASTEC, LH15T40,
vertical field). The solution in the cell was irradiated by a UV light from
an XeCl excimer laser (Lambda Physik, COMPEX 102, 308 nm) through a
hole (6 mm) of a copper shade attached on the outer bottom surface of the
cell. It was placed at the upper (10 T, -1300 T' m'), middle (14 T, 0 T^
m'^) and lower (11 T, -I-IOOO T^ m~') positions in the bore tube and at zero
field (0 T, 0 T^ m"'). The movement of the red PI solution after laser
irradiation (94 mJ pulse', 3 Hz, 3 s) was observed using a CCD camera-
video system. The locations where the color of the PI solution was the
most intense in pictures were traced manually.
Figure 2-4-1 shows sequential photos demonstrating the movement
of the PI solution in magnetic fields. The photos taken at a 10-s delay after
laser irradiation indicate that the movement of the PI solution at 10 T
(-1300 T^ m~^) is retarded compared with those at other magnetic fields,
whereas those taken at a 20-s delay show that the PI solution at 11 T
(-1-1000 T^ m~') stops at the upper part of the solution. On the other hand,
the movement at 14 T (0 T^ m"') is similar to that at zero field, indicating
that it is not magnetic field but magnetic force that is responsible for the
movement of PI solution in magnetic fields.
Figure 2-4-2 shows the movements of the PI solution after laser
irradiation in magnetic fields. The movement of the PI solution is divided

into two stages. The first is the removal of the PI solution from the bottom
of the cell. The second is the motion in the bulk solution after the removal.
At zero field, the PI solution lifts from the bottom surface at a 5-s delay
after laser excitation. At -1300 T^ m"', the solution lifts at a 9-s delay. At
+1000 T^ m~^ it lifts at a 3-s delay, and then finally returns to the lower
part of the cell. The initial lift speed of the PI solution in the bulk solution
is about 0.4 mm s"' regardless of the magnetic field.
The removal of the PI solution is explained by the pressure difference
between the bulk CMTE solution and the PI solution, which is given by
the following equation.

where Apsoiution is the density change of the solution, A;fbenzene the magnetic

height of the PI solution, g gravity, //o the magnetic permeability of
vacuum, B the magnetic flux density, dB/dz the gradient of B to the vertical
z direction, ;|fpi and ;fcMTE are magnetic susceptibilities of PI and CMTE,
respectively, and c is the concentration of the solute. The first term on the
right-hand side of Eq. (1) is the photo-induced density change of the
solution, consisting of the volume change of benzene due to temperature
jump and that of the solute due to photo-isomerization. The second term is
the magnetic susceptibility change of benzene due to the temperature jump
and the third is the magnetic susceptibility change of the solute due to
photo-isomerization. The temperature of the PI solution changes with time
as it is cooled by the surrounding bulk solution; therefore the first and
second terms are time dependent.
At zero field, the thermal motion of the PI solution is induced by the
first term of Eq. (1). In magnetic fields, the second and third terms also
contribute to the convection. The direction of the magnetic force on
diamagnetic CMTE and PI is upward at the upper position, which acts in
the opposite direction to gravity, whereas it is downward at the lower
position, acting in the same direction as gravity.
From experimental data, the temperature jump of the PI solution due
to laser irradiation is roughly estimated to be 0.4°C. Then, AP values are
tentatively esfimated using the experimental data in the literature. AP
values are estimated assuming that the concentration of the solute is
negligibly small. At zero field, AP is 5.88/z Nm'-. At the upper and lower
positions, the AP values are 0.41/z and 10.09/z, respectively. At the upper
position, the PI solution stays at the bottom for longer time compared to
that at zero field, since AP is reduced by one order of magnitude because of
a magnetic force of -5.47/i. At the lower position, the PI solution moves
from the surface faster than at zero field, and AP becomes about double the
value at zero field. The observation that the PI solution at the lower
position moves downward cannot be explained solely by the magnetic
susceptibility change of benzene. It could be explained by taking into
account the third term in the right-hand side of Eq. (1). As it lifts the PI
solution is cooled by the bulk solution and the contribution of the first and
second terms to the upward movement fades out. Therefore, if ;ifpi < ;I^CMTE
< 0, the third term, which is downward at the lower position, may induce
the downward movement of the PI solution after it is cooled to the
surrounding temperature.
The initial lift speed of the PI solution in the bulk solution should be
explained similarly by using Eq. (1). However, the speed is almost the

--- Page 100 ---

80 2 Effects of Magnetic Force
same regardless of magnetic field. From the laser power dependence of
removal time and lift speed, it is found that the influence of magnetic
fields on the solution at the bottom surface is slightly different from that on
the solution in bulk, i.e., floating solution. With increasing laser power, the
removal time becomes short and lift speed becomes faster in all magnetic
field conditions. However, at higher power the removal time becomes
almost the same, whereas the lift speed is almost independent of the
magnetic forces at lower power. Therefore, the above-mentioned lift
speeds are those under low laser power condition. It seems that the
solution near the bottom surface is slightly different from that in bulk
solution, as the former might adhere slightly to the surface due to surface
tension. As a result, the response on the magnetic force in the surface
solution might be slightly different from that in bulk solution.
2.4.2 Photoreaction of Diphenylamine and Carbon Tetrabromide"*^
Next, thermal convection of benzene solution was examined using
photoreaction of diphenylamine (DPA) and carbon tetrabromide (CBr4). A
blue dye (4,4^4"-tri(anilino)triphenylmethane bromide, TATPM) is
formed on photo-irradiation of a solution of DPA and CBr4.^^ Thus, this
reaction was carried out using UV light from a high pressure Xe-lamp. Fig.
2-4-3 shows the movement of a TATPM solution after UV irradiation of
benzene solution of DPA and CBr4 in magnetic fields. At zero field, the
TATPM solution generated at the bottom of the cell moves from the
bottom at a 10 s delay after the starting photo-irradiation and moves
upward with a lift speed of 0.4 mm s~\ In a magnetic field of -1200 T^

m ^ the removal time and lift speed are 5 s and 3 mm s"', respectively. At
+1000 T^ m~\ the TATPM solution does not move from the bottom surface
but spreads predominantly in the horizontal direction on the bottom
surface. So magnetic force can enhance or depress the thermally induced
convection of the solution, depending on its direction.
The behavior of the TATPM solution in magnetic fields is opposite to
that of the PI solution shown in Fig. 2-4-2. In the DPA-CBr4 reaction the
concentration of solutes is as high as 5 x 10"^ mol dm'^ compared to that
of CMTE. If the magnetic susceptibility change in the solutes is larger than
that in benzene and the magnetic susceptibility of TATPM is smaller than
that of DPA and CBr4, the movement of TATPM in magnetic fields is
explainable using Eq. (1). It is interesting that thermal convection of
benzene is controlled not only by its own magnetic susceptibility but also
by that of the solutes.
Thus far, the shape of floating solutions in magnetic fields has not
been discussed. In the case of the DPA-CBr4 reaction, for example, the
shapes of the TATPM floating solution in magnetic fields are considerably
different from that at zero field. Even at 14 T (0 T^ m'^), where no
magnetic force is expected, the shape of the TATPM solution is less
diffused than that at 0 T (0 T^ m~'). These facts indicate that even a
homogeneous field might act on the motion of the solution. This
unexpected observation could be partly explained by introducing a new
magnetic force based on the magnetic susceptibility gradient. When its
magnetic susceptibility is inhomogeneous, a solution is expected to receive
a new magnetic force, F mag,^^
FLs={l/2no)(dx/dz)B' (2)
where dx/dz is the gradient of x in the z direction. The force is dependent
on the square of a homogeneous field B and not BdBldz. This means that a
homogenous field also induces a magnetic force. If the magnetic
susceptibility of the DPA-CBr4 solution is different from that of the
TATPM solution, F mag may act on the interface of the two solutions. As a
result, the diffusive motion of the TATPM solution could be affected by the
force, leading to the shape change of the solution in a magnetic field. By
taking Fmag into account, we could partly explain why the shape of the
floating solution in a homogenous field of 14 T (0 T^ m'^) is less diffused.
Analysis of the experimental data including Fmag is in progress.
In conclusion, it has been clearly demonstrated that thermal
convection can be controlled by using magnetic force.

2.5 Magnetic Separation of Transition Metal Ions
2.5.1 Magnetic Energy and Thermal Energy
In order for particles to be separated by a magnetic field, the magnetic
force acting on the particles must be more effective than the thermal
fluctuation induced by a solvent environment. The magnetic energy
(XnHVl = 1.7 X 10"^^ J) of a paramagnetic ion (x = 2,000 X 10"^ cm' mo^^
l/n = 6.0 X 10^^ mol"') in a strong magnetic field (H = 100 kOe) is much
less than its thermal energy (3kT/2 = 6.2 x 10"'^ J, k : Boltzmann constant)
in a room-temperature solution (T = 300 K). Therefore, it has been
believed that the paramagnetic ions are diffused by the thermal fluctuation
but not separated by the magnetic force in the solution. Since the magnetic
energy of a paramagnetic particle of larger size (> 1.0 jim) is larger than its
thermal energy, many studies have focused on separation of the
paramagnetic particles.
Recently, we have succeeded in the separation of transition metal
ions in an inhomogeneous magnetic field.^^^ This section deals with the
mechanism of the magnetic separation of transition metal ions.
2.5.2 Separation of Metal Ions in a Magnetic Field
The magnetic field is horizontal and inhomogeneous. The field intensity is
80 kOe at the field center, and the field intensity x gradient is 410 kOe^
cm"' at ± 65 mm from the field center. The metal ion solutions were
spotted onto the silica gel support at 100 mm from the field center and
exposed to the magnetic field.
The separation of the Cu'^ (1,500 x 10^ cm' mol') and Ag^ (-24 x
10"^ cm' mol') ions in the magnetic field is shown in Fig. 2-5-1.'^ When
the magnetic field is applied, the Cu'^^ ions are attracted by -48 mm toward
the field center, but the Ag^ ions stay at the spot position. Fig. 2-5-2 shows
the distributions of the Cu^^ and Ag^ ions measured in the field direction
from the spot position. If the whole area is divided by a line at 10 mm, the
purity of the Cu^^ ions is -90 mol% in the region of > 10 mm, and the
purity of the Ag"^ ions -90 mol% in the region of < 10 mm.
The separation was also examined for the Co^^ (9,500 x 10"^ cm'
mol-') and Fe'^ (14,600 x 10^ cm' mol') ions and for the Cr'^ (6,200 x
10"^ cm' mol') and AP (-2 x 10^ cm' mol') ions in the magnetic field.^^

84 2 Effects of Magnetic Force
The Co^^ ions move by -58 mm toward the field center, but the Fe"^^ ions
move only by -27 mm. The purity of the Co'^ ions is -82 mol% in the
region of > 45 mm, and the purity of the Fe"^^ ions -82 mol% in the region
of < 45 mm. The Cr^^ ions move sharply by -57 mm toward the maximum
field, while the Al^^ ions follow them by -34 mm with tailing. The purity
of the Cr^^ ions is -77 mol% in the region of > 51 mm, and the purity of
the AP^ ions -77 mol% in the region of < 51 mm.
The magnetic separation of the metal ions is understood by the
attractive power of the magnetic field and by the adsorption activity of the
silica gel particles.
The Cu^^ (1,500 x 10"^ cm^ mol'), Co'^ (9,500 x 10^ cm^ mol"*)
and Cr^"" (6,200 x 10"^ cm'' mol"^) ions move toward the field center
because these paramagnetic ions are attracted by the magnetic force in the
direction of the maximum field.
The Ag^ (-24 x 10"^ cm'' mol"') ions do not leave the spot position
for the following reasons. First, the Ag^ ions have a small diamagnetic
susceptibility and are not affected by a weak magnetic force. Second, the
Ag"" ions are adsorbed strongly on the silica gel support and do not move in
any direction.
The Fe^^ (14,600 x 10^ cm^ mol') ions move less than the Co'^ ions,
though the Fe^^ ions have a larger paramagnetic susceptibility than the
Co^^ ions. This is because the Fe^^ ions are adsorbed more strongly on the
silica gel support than the Co"^ ions (Section 2.5.3).
The AP"^ (-2 X 10"^ cm^ mol') ions follow the Cr^"^ ions easily. Since
the AF"^ ions are not adsorbed strongly on the silica gel support, the Cr^""
ions, AF^ ions and water molecules form a group which is paramagnetic as
a whole and it is attracted toward the field center (Section 2.5.4).
2.5.3 Adsorption on Silica Gel Particles
The separation of the Co^"^ and Fe''^ ions is explained quantitatively by the
relationship between the magnetically moving distance and thermally
diffusing distance.^^ The different mechanisms of motions involve the fact
that the magnetic movement takes place as the motion of a group
composed of metal ions and water molecules (Section 2.5.4) but the
thermal diffusion occurs as the motion of a single metal ion.
For a group composed of metal ions and water molecules, the
distance z(t) of movement at time t in a magnetic field H(z) measures the
frictional coefficient/G (of metal-water group) and magnetic force F(z), the
latter of which is a function of the molar susceptibility x ^nd mole number
n of the metal ions (Section 2.5.4).

= \l(Xn/fG)[H(z)dH{z)/dz]dt

--- Page 105 ---

2.5 Magnetic Separation of Transition Metal Ions 85
Approximately, the frictional coefficient /G of the metal-water group is
inversely proportional to the distance z(t) of movement.
In the magnetic movement of the Co'^ and Fe^^ ions, the parameter
fc/xn is estimated by numerical integration from the moving distance in the
magnetic field. The magnetic susceptibility x^ of the metal-water group is
assumed to be the sum xconco + jfpe^Fe for the Co*^"" and Fe^^ ions, since the
metal-water group is attracted as a whole by the magnetic force. The ratio
of the frictional coefficients between the Co^^ and Fe"^^ ions is
/G.CO / fcjc = (/G.CO / Xr^) / (/c.Fe / X^^)
= 0.51
For a single metal ion, the mean distance <r(t)> of diffusion at time t
in the two-dimensional space is a measure of the diffusion coefficient D,
which is related to the frictional coefficient /s (of single metal ion) at
temperature T.
<r(t)>'=KDt
= 7tkTt/fs ^^^
where k is the Boltzmann constant. The frictional coefficient /s of the
single metal ion is inversely proportional to the square of the mean
distance <K0> of diffusion.
In the thermal diffusion of the Co'^ and Fe^^ ions, the parameter
fs/jrkT is calculated from the diffusion distance on the silica gel particles.
The ratio of the frictional coefficients between the Co^^ and Fe^^ ions is
/s,Co / /s,Fe = (/s,Co / TtkT) I (/s.Fe / KkT)
= 0.55
The frictional coefficient/G of the surface of the metal-water group is
expected to be proportional to the frictional coefficient /s of the single
metal ion, because the adsorption activity of the surface of the metal-water
group is similar to the adsorption activity of the single metal ion. This
expectation is in agreement with the above estimation of the ratio of the
frictional coefficients for the Co^^ and Fe"^^ ions, indicating that the
separation of the Co^^ and Fe^^ ions in the magnetic field is achieved by
the adsorption on the silica gel particles.
2.5.4 Movement of Paramagnetic Ions in a Magnetic Field: Theory
The movement of metal ions in a magnetic field is understood as the drift
motion of a group composed of metal ions and water molecules.^^ The
mathematical expressions are derived for the magnetic movement of the
metal ions.
Suppose that metal ions with molar susceptibility x ^^^ mole number
n are placed at position z in a magnetic field. The magnetic force F{z)
acting on the metal ions is expressed by

--- Page 106 ---

86 2 Effects of Magnetic Force
Fiz) = xnH(z)dH(z)/dz (3)
If the metal ions are paramagnetic (x > 0), the magnetic force works in the
direction where the field intensity increases, and the metal ions are
attracted toward the maximum field.
The movement of the n metal ions is described as the drift motion of
a group composed of metal ions and water molecules. The drift velocity
v(z) is related to the magnetic force F(z) by
v(z) = F(z)/f (4)
where / is the frictional coefficient which the metal-water group
experiences against a bulk water environment or silica gel support.
Now, it must be recalled that the position z of the n metal ions is an
implicit function of time /. The metal ions start from the position z = zo at
time t = ro and go across the position z = zi at time t = t\. The distance z\ -
Zo on which the metal ions move in the time interval t\ - to is given by
Z\-Zo = \''v(z)dt (5)
which is rewritten from Eqs. (3) and (4) as
zi - Zo =(xn / f)\\H(z)dH(z)/dz]dt (6)
Then the distance z\ - zo is calculated by numerical integration of Eq. (6).
The parameter//;fn is the only one involved in Eq. (6) and determined by
comparison with the observation.
The group of metal ions and water molecules is assumed to be a
sphere of hydrodynamic radius R in which the metal ions are contained
with molar concentration c. The frictional coefficient/is expressed by the
Stokes relation of
f = 6KriR (7)
where rj is the viscosity of the medium. The mole number n is related to
the molar concentration c by
n = {4n/3)R'c (8)
The parameter//;fn in Eq. (6) is written from Eqs. (7) and (8) in the form of
f/Xn = 9ri/2xR'c (9)
The right side of Eq. (9) involves explicitly the molar susceptibility x and
molar concentration c of the metal ions and enables one to estimate the
radius R of the metal-water group from the parameter//;|f«.
2.5.5 Movement of Paramagnetic Ions in a Magnetic Field:
Experiment
The magnetic movement of metal ions depends on the susceptibility of the

--- Page 107 ---

2.5 Magnetic Separation of Transition Metal Ions 87
metal ions.^^ The movement was observed for Mn^^ (x = 14,200 x 10"^ cm^
mol-^), Co'" ix = 9,500 x 10"' cm^ mol'), Cr'" (j = 6,200 x 10"' cm'
mol'), NP ix = 4,200 x lO"" cm' mol') and Cu'" {x = 1,500 x 10"" cm'
mol') ions. The solution containing the metal ions was spotted onto the
silica gel support and exposed to the magnetic field. The metal ions move
toward the field center, and the larger movement (Mn'" > Co'" > Cr'"^ >
Ni'" > Cu'") corresponds to the larger susceptibility (Mn'" > Co'" > Cr'" >
Ni'" > Cu'") for the metal ions.
The parameter//;fn was calculated numerically by Eq. (6) and plotted
logarithmically as a function of the molar susceptibility x of the metal ions.
(The parameter//;fn is the ratio of the frictional coefficient/to the product
of the molar susceptibility x and mole number n for the metal ions.) The
observed points were fitted with a line of slope of -1.11 ±0.11. Clearly,
the parameter fixn is inversely proportional to the molar susceptibility x-
This means that the driving force of the movement is the magnetic force
acting on the metal ions, as given in Eq. (3).
The magnetic movement of metal ions is dependent on the
concentration of the metal ions.'^ The movement was examined for various
concentrations of Cu'" ions. The Cu"" ion solution was spotted onto the
silica gel support and exposed to the magnetic field. When the
concentration of the Cu'" ions is higher, they move farther toward the
maximum field.
The parameter//;fn is plotted logarithmically in Fig. 2-5-3 against the
concentration c of the Cu'" ions. After the solution was spotted, the Cu'"
ions diffused, and the initial concentration decreased. Thus, the
concentration is estimated in Fig. 2-5-3 at 0 (initial concentration), 1 and
2 h from the spot fime of the solution. (The initial concentration at 0 h
decreases immediately and does not give an estimate of the concentration
during the movement of the Cu'" ions.) The observed points are fitted
linearly with slopes of-0.83 ± 0.04, -1.02 ± 0.05 and -1.01 ± 0.03 for 0, 1
and 2 h, respectively. It is clear from the slopes for 1 and 2 h that the
parameter//;fn is inversely proportional to the concentration c.
The movement of metal ions is discussed from the possible viewpoint
of the drift motion of the single metal ion. If a single Cu'" ion ix = 1,500 x
10"^ cm' mol', \ln = 6.022 x 10'' mor\ IR = 0.40 nm) is assumed to
move in a water environment (rj = 1.0 mPa s), the frictional coeflicient/is
calculated to be 3.8 x 10"'^ kg s"' from the Stokes relation in Eq. (7). The
parameter//;^n is predicted to be 1.5 x 10'' m"' kg s'', which is
independent of the concentration c of the Cu'" ions. This is in conflict with
the observation in Fig. 2-5-3, denying the movement of the single metal
ion.
The movement of metal ions is discussed on the model of the drift
modon of a group composed of metal ions and water molecules. If the
sphere of a metal-water group moves in a water environment, the mole

estimated at 0 (circles), 1 (triangles) and 2 (squares) h from the spotting time of the
solution.

number n is proportional to the concentration c for the metal ions in the
group, as given in Eq. (8). Then the parameter//;f« is inversely
proportional to the concentration c, as in Eq. (9). This expectation is in
agreement with the observation in Fig. 2-5-3, showing that the metal ions
move not as a single particle, but as a large group composed of metal ions
and water molecules. From the line for 1 h in Fig. 2-5-3, the diameter 2R is
estimated to be 2.4 |xm, and the frictional coefficient/is predicted to be 2.3
X 10"^ kg s"' for the Cu'^-H20 group. It is indicated that the large
metal-water group of 2.4 |Lim diameter moves in the water environment.
2.5.6 Magnetic Susceptibility and Adsorption Activity
Metal ions with paramagnetic susceptibility move by magnetic force, not
as a single particle, but as a large group composed of the metal ions and
water molecules. The metal ions are separated when they are adsorbed on
the silica gel particles. Magnetic separation makes effective use of the
magnetic susceptibility and adsorption activity.

2.6 Magnetic Force Used for Micropatteming, Separation and Processing 89
2.6 Magnetic Force Used for Micropatteming, Separation and
Processing
In this section, we demonstrate our recent work on the use of magnetic
force for the manipulation of particles. The section starts with a description
of the underlying mechanism of particle transport under a field gradient in
association with the Brownian motion and gravity, followed by examples
of application that include micropatteming of particles, separation of
polymers and polymerization of a large polymer sphere in a magnetic field.
2.6.1 Mechanism
Let us consider particles each having a volume V (m') and a diamagnetic
susceptibility Xv'> suspended in a liquid medium of a magnetic
suscepdbility x^- Flux of the particles takes place if a magnetic field
gradient VB^ is applied. In addition, if there is a gradient of the particle
concentration, a flux due to the Brownian motion takes place. The total
flux / is then written as the sum of these fluxes. ^^^
/ = c£(-yV^>VG + (2//or'A;fVVfi2) (1)
where c (mol m~^) is the concentration of the particle, e (vcc s"^ J"^) the
mobility of the particle related to the diffusion constant through the
Einstein relation (D = ek^ r, with ^B being the Boltzmann constant), TVA the
Avogadro number, jUo the magnetic permeability of vacuum, B (T) the
magnetic flux density, lsx-X\>- X^ ^i^d G the chemical potential of the
particle defined by G = Go + RTln a^c with Go and a^ being a reference
chemical potential and the activity coefficient, respectively.
Substituting G (assuming a^ - 1 for simplicity, i.e., a suspension or a
solution is ideal) into Eq. (1), putting 7 = 0, then carrying out the
integration, we obtain the equilibrium distribution for the concentration
profile c. In the one-dimensional case, we obtain
c(x)/c(xo) = exp((2/io)"'A;fV(5-U)-5^(xo))//:Br) (2)
where jco is a reference position. This is the Boltzmann factor determined
by the ratio of the magnetic energy to the thermal energy. It should be
noted that the mobility does not come into the equilibrium distribution.
Let us consider a simple case of diamagnetic particles trapped in a
harmonic well of magnetic energy: in Eq. (2) we put C(JC)/C(0) = exp(-ajc^)
with a proportional to (2^o)"^ IA;^! VB^Ik^T. Here we assume that the
medium is paramagnedc, i.e., A;^ < 0. The half width of the resuking
concentration profile is proportional to 1/va, indicating that the width is
sharper for particles of larger size and for the combination of the medium
and the particle that makes |A/| large.
The transient behavior from the initial distribution to the equilibrium
is described by Pick's second law, 3c/3t = -V • /. A quicker equilibrium is

reached if the term (2jUo)~'A;fVVi5' in Eq. (1), corresponding to the
magnetic force acting on the particle, is large. A large gradient V^^ is
attained in the vicinity of the edge of a ferromagnetic material placed in a
homogeneous magnetic field because the magnetic flux density is
concentrated at the edge. For simplicity, let us consider a one-dimensional
case where VB^ is written as B dBldx. In the vicinity of a ferromagnetic
material, placed in a field of 1 T, having a width of Ar = 100 |Lim and AJ5 =
1 T, for example, we have B AB/Ax = 10^ T' m"^ This magnitude is almost
seven times larger than that needed to levitate a water droplet in air (1400
T^ m"'). It is concluded that the high field gradient necessary for a rapid
build-up of the equilibrium is obtained around the thin edge of the
ferromagnetic material placed in a magnetic field.
If the particle size is large, the sedimentation term should also be
considered. The flux due to gravity, ceV Apg , should be added to Eq. (1),
where g is a vertical vector corresponding to the gravity and Ap = pp - pm is
the difference in density between the particle (p) and suspending medium
(m). If the Brownian term is negligibly small compared to the other two,
the balance of the magnetic force and the gravitational force is expressed
as
-Apg^(2nor'Ax(^B'h=0 (3)
where g = |g|, and the suffix z indicates the vertical component. Eq. (3)
determines the vertical location of the particle floating in a liquid medium.
Particles with different Ap/Aj levitate at different vertical locations,
resulting in separation."^^
The alignment could be associated with the trap if the particle has a
magnetic anisotropy. The particles align in the direction of the field at the
location where they are trapped. In this case, XP in Ax should be replaced
with the largest susceptibility value.
2.6.2 Field Modulator
As discussed in the previous section, diamagnetic particles suspended in a
surrounding paramagnetic medium are trapped to the place where the field
strength is weak. Therefore, micropatteming of particles becomes possible
if a microscopically modulated field is available. We reported^' that a
homogeneous field is modulated in the vicinity of the surface of a field
modulator inserted into the field. Modulators composed of alternating
feeble magnetic and ferromagnetic layers, each having a thickness of 50 or
300 jLim, were used. Because the magnetic flux is selectively directed
toward the ferromagnetic layers, the field profile is periodically modulated
near the modulator surface. The persistent length of the modulation is
expected to follow the order of the pitch of the layer structure of the
modulator: the shorter the pitch, the shorter the persistence over the
modulator surface. A schematic diagram of a field modulator is shown in
Fig. 2-6-1.

/ Sample cCD
Fig. 2-6-1 A field modulator and experimental set-up with a magnetic field. EM, P and CCD indicate
electromagnet, pole piece and CCD camera, respectively.
The location of the minimum of the field produced by a modulator
depends on which direction the magnetic field is applied from. There are
two cases: the field direcdon is (i) parallel or (ii) perpendicular to the
surface of the alternating layers. The field strength is lower above the
feeble magnetic layers in case (i), while it is lower above the ferromagnetic
layers in case (ii). This indicates that by switching the field direction by
90°, we can obtain the negative and positive patterns. The location of the
trapped particles depends on the sign of Ax = ;fp - 7m. If the particles are
relatively diamagnetic with respect to the medium (Ax < 0), they are
trapped at the place of the field minima. It is not necessary for the particles
to be diamagnetic and the medium to be paramagnetic. The magnetic
nature of the particle relative to that of the surrounding medium determines
the location of trapping.
2.6.3 Micro Moses Effect
The microscopically modulated field causes not only the particle
micropatteming but also the micro undulafion of a fluid surface.^^ This
undulation is referred to as the "micro Moses effect" in accordance with
the term "Moses effect" given to the phenomenon of surface splitting
under a magnetic field gradient on the macroscopic scale.'* ^^ The term
"enhanced micro Moses effect" can also be used corresponding to
enhanced Moses effect.^^
Figure 2-6-2 shows an example of the micro Moses effect. A field
modulator composed of alternating aluminum and iron sheets 300-|im
thick was used. A mixture of water, ethanol and MnCh • 4H2O of
composition of 2:6:1 by weight was poured onto a Kapton film (25 |j.m)
that was in close contact with the surface of the field modulator, then
placed in the center of an electromagnet (see Fig. 2-6-1). In the absence of
the field, the surface of the liquid was flat, as seen in Fig. 2-6-2(a). Upon
application of a field of 1 T, the surface was undulated (Fig. 2-6-2(b)) in

--- Page 112 ---

accordance with the field modulation. The modulation proceeded without
delay, following the change in field strength. The liquid used here is
paramagnetic due to the addition of MnCb, hence the hills and valleys
correspond to the aluminum and iron layers, respectively.
2.6.4 Micropatterning
Trapping of polystyrene spheres (20 )im diameter) suspended in a liquid
was carried out using the same field modulator used above.*^^ A droplet of a
suspension was poured onto a Kapton film that was in close contact with
the field modulator. In this experiment, the liquid layer was thick so that no
micro Moses effect occurred. Before application of the magnetic field, the
spheres were dispersed uniformly. Upon application of the field, the
spheres started to accumulate above the iron layers to form broad lines. It
took about 15 min to bring the spheres to a complete accumulation.
In order to enhance the trapping rate and the sharpness of the line,
MnCl2 was added to the suspension. This made the difference A;if = ;fp - Xm
large, resulting in enhancement of the trapping force. The polystyrene
spheres were trapped within a few minutes to form a self-assembled line
pattern, which remained upon evaporation of the liquid medium in the
presence of the magnetic field.''
We also used a modulator made of 50-|Lim-thick aluminum and iron
sheets. At this thickness, the width of the field minimum is 50 |Lim at most.
If the trapping power is increased by increasing A;^, the resulting half width
of the particle profile may be much narrower than 50 |im. In fact, only one
20-|im polystyrene sphere was allowed to be trapped in this potential
valley. The trapping was possible for particles of smaller size. The
patterning of Si02 particles of 1 |im diameter was possible using a 50-|im
modulator.

2.6 Magnetic Force Used for Micropatteming. Separation and Processing 93
2.6.5 Separation
Equation (3) indicates the possibility of a separation of particles based on
the difference in ts.plt^x- Magnetic separation of plastic pellets was
demonstrated.^^ Pellets of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, p = 1.18 g
cm~^) and poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET, p = 1.41 g cm'^) were put in
an aqueous solution of manganese chloride (p = 1.10 g cm'\ ;f =1.7 x 10^)
contained in a glass tube. They sank to the bottom of the glass tube. Then
the glass tube was placed between the pole pieces of an electromagnet that
could generate a horizontal field of up to 2 T so that the pellets were
located above the center of the pole pieces. With increase in field strength,
the pellets levitated in different locations, reaching a maximum separation
of 17 mm at a BABldiZ value of about -20 to -70 T^ m~^ Other polymers
including polystyrene and polypropylene were also separated.
2.6.6 Levitation Polymerization
To fabricate polymer spheres of micrometer size, suspension
polymerization is usually used. Small droplets of a monomer suspended in
a liquid by agitation, forming spherical shape due to the surface tension,
are polymerized to obtain solid spheres. This method, however, cannot be
used to fabricate large spheres of centimeter size. A large droplet cannot
maintain its spherical shape in a suspension because flotation to the
medium surface causes it to lose its sphericity. Flotation can be avoided if
the densities of the droplet and the suspending medium are precisely
adjusted, but it is very difficult to find an aqueous medium having a
density as low as that of organic monomers. Even if one was found to meet
this condition, the droplet would move around in the container because no
trapping force acts on it, leading to deformation of the spherical shape by
contact with the container wall, for example.
Magnetic trapping is a promising way to eliminate these difficulties.^^
Using magnetic trapping, we succeeded in fabricating a large polymer
sphere. This method is referred to as "levitation polymerization." A benzyl
methacrylate droplet of ca. 1 cm diameter containing an initiator of
polymerization was stably trapped in an aqueous solution of manganese
chloride using a magnetic field gradient generated by a cryogen-free
superconducting magnet. It polymerized slowly to reach a solid sphere as
shown in Fig. 2-6-3. During polymerization, the density of the sphere
changed, hence the levitation balance was lost. Therefore, it was necessary
to change the electric current supplied to the magnet so that the t^pltsx
value was maintained to keep the sphere at the same location in the
suspension. Without doing so, the sphere became out of trapping before
complete solidification and the spherical shape was not achieved.

about 1 cm in diameter. The arrow points at a small sphere fabricated by conventional
suspension polymerization.
2.6.7 Conclusion
In this section, some uses of magnetic force have been described. Magnetic
force can be as large as gravitational force. With particles of smaller size,
for example, micrometer size, the Brownian motion becomes effective.
Temporal change of the concentration distribution of the particles under
the Brownian motion and the magnetic field gradient is described by the
diffusion equation. The solution to the stationary state is given by the
Boltzmann distribution, which is a function of the ratio of magnetic energy
to thermal energy.
It has been demonstrated that the use of a field modulator is useful
for the micropatterning of particles. A modulator inserted into a
homogeneous magnetic field creates potential minima where particles are
trapped. The microscopic undulation of a liquid surface (micro Moses
effect) is another application of the field modulator.
Two applications of the use of the macroscopic minimum created by
the balance of magnetic force and the gravitational force have been
demonstrated. One is the separation of polymer pellets, which may be
useful for plastic recycling. The other is "levitation polymerization," by
which polymer spheres of ca. 1 cm in diameter are fabricated.

2.7 Quantitative Evaluation of Solid Fraction 95
2.7 Quantitative Evaluation of Solid Fraction during
Solidification or Melting Processes of Metals Using
Measurement of Magnetic Susceptibility
Recently, magnetic force in nonmagnetic materials has become detectable
under a high magnetic field just like in ferromagnetic materials because the
technology required has become available. In order to develop materials
processing to make use of the high magnetic field, magnetic susceptibility
of materials must be measured.
Hitherto, the magnetic susceptibility of various materials has been
measured at a fixed temperature. A few continuous measurements
accompanied by phase transformation have been reported. ^'^^ The
continuous measurement of magnetic susceptibility will provide better
understanding of solidifying and melting phenomena and become useful in
the field of nonmagnetic materials processing.
The magnetic susceptibility can be estimated using a new apparatus
for continuously measuring the change in magnetic force during a phase
transformation. Based on the additivity of the magnetic susceptibility, a
new method quantitatively evaluating transitional solid fractions during
solidifying and melting processes has been proposed. This method has
been applied to the solidifying and melting of bismuth and zinc and
enables quantitative evaluation of the transitional reaction rate in various
chemical reaction processes and phase transitions.
2.7.1 Magnetic Susceptibility Measurement
A. Method
Magnetic susceptibility was measured by the Gouy method.^'^^ The
magnetic force of a cylindrical sample in a magnetic field Bz is given as
Eq.(l)
F.=\jmSdz^^Xr^[Bl-Bl) (1)
where S is the sectional area of the sample (m'^), L the sample height (m),
/io the magnetic permeability in vacuum (H m~*), ms the mass of the sample
(kg), ;fm the magnetic susceptibility (m^ kg'), ^L and ^o the magnetic fiux
density (T) of the sample at the top and bottom parts, respectively. Taking
the weight difference of the sample measured by the electronic balance in
the cases with and without the magnetic field gives the magnetic force,
Eq.(2).
Fz^=M/-M. (2)
Since this magnetic force still contains the gravity and magnetic
forces contributed by the crucible and wire, it is not a pure magnetic force
provided by the sample itself. Thus, the weights (M'E and ME) of the
crucible without the sample were measured in the cases with and without
the magnetic field and subtracted from Eq. (2).

B. Results of Measurements
The continuous measurements of temperature and magnetic susceptibility
of Bi are shown in Fig. 2-7-1. The time is designated as 0 at the moment
recalescence takes place. The cooling rate of each sample was determined
from the cooling curve at the moment of 270°C near the melting point
271.4°^*^ for bismuth. The relationship between the temperature and
magnetic susceptibility during the period from the starting point of the
recalescence to the completion of solidification is shown in Fig. 2-7-2. It is
found that the measured value extrapolated at 20°C agrees with the
reported value of 1.7 x 10"^ m^ kg"^ within error of 1.0 x 10"^ m^ kg"'. As
seen in Figs. 2-7-1 and 2-7-2, a dramatic change in magnetic susceptibility
appears not during the supercooling but just after termination of
supercooling. This indicates that the atomic structure of the molten metal
was maintained during the supercooling state and literally reflects the
supercooling phenomenon.

2.7.2 Calculation of Solid Fraction
A. Method
The sohd fraction in a sohd-hquid mixed phase can be calculated from the
observed magnetic susceptibility and temperature as follows. From Fig. 2-
7-2, which shows the relationship between the magnetic susceptibility and
temperature, the magnetic susceptibilities of both solid and liquid phases
can be expressed by linear functions of the temperature around the melting
point with a good approximation. Specifically, the magnetic susceptibilities
in the single solid and liquid phases are given by Eqs. (5) and (6).
^ml=Ciir+Ci2 (5)
= Cs,r+Cs: (6)
Cii and Ci2 are obtained from the magnetic susceptibility and cooling
temperature observed before reaching the melting point, and Csi and Csi
also obtained from the above two variables measured after solidification.
The magnetic susceptibility Xm of a liquid and solid mixture phase is given
byEq.(7).

In addition, Eq.(8) clearly holds.

Then, Eq. (9) can be obtained.

B. Results
The relation between the solid fraction and temperature in the cooling
process is shown in Fig. 2-7-3. The solid fraction of about 20 mass%

temperature had recovered to the melting point. The relation between the

time and solid fraction in the heating process are shown in Figs. 2-7-5 and

superheating did not take place during the heating process.

2.8 Magnetic Control of Gas Flow, Combustion and Oxidation
Reaction - Magnetoaerodynamics
2.8.1 Magnetically Induced Gas Flows
Recently, magnetic effects on gas flow, combustion and chemical reactions
involving O2 gas have been quantitatively studied, and it has been clarified
that the primary component of these magnetic effects is the existence of
magnetic attractive forces acting on paramagnetic oxygen gas. The study
of the interaction between electrically nonconducting paramagnetic oxygen
gases and magnetic fields is a new interdisciplinary research area called
"magnetoaerodynamics."
A. Magnetic Attraction of O2 Gas
Magnetic field gradients produced by ordinary electromagnets exert a
significant force on advancing O2 gas stream in air.''^^ When a mixture of
O2 gas and water mist is introduced through a plastic tube into the diameter
gap of an electromagnet, in the presence of a magnetic field, the oxygen
gas mixture is attracted toward the magnetic field and remains between the
magnetic poles. The water mist is used to visualize the gas flow. On the
other hand, in the absence of a magnetic field, the O2 gas mixture flows
downward. Thus, oxygen gas is attracted toward an electromagnet, similar
to a magnetic fluid.
B. Behavior of Diamagnetic N2 Gas Injected into Air
Magnetic field gradients have also been found to have significant effect on
diamagnetic N2 gas flow injected into air. A mixture of nitrogen gas
(700 cm^ min"') and water mist (0.2 g min"') was injected into air from a
glass tube. In the absence of magnetic fields, N2 gas mixture flows
unobstructed, as shown in Fig. 2-8-1(b). But when the gas outlet is set at
upper position A in Fig. 2-8-2(a) and the N2 gas flows toward a weaker

field, it accelerates and behaves like a jet stream, as shown in Fig. 2-8-
l(a).^'^^ The velocity of N2 gas jet 1 cm above the head of the tube
increases with increasing magnetic strength //o at the center of the
electromagnet. When N2 gas is injected from a lower position C in the
direction of the increasing magnetic field, it flows downward along the
surface of the tube toward a weaker field. This phenomenon was
discovered by Faraday."^^ When N: gas is injected into a uniform field (B)
around the center of the magnet, no such effect is observed.
C. Quantitative Analysis of Air Convection Caused by Magnetic-fluid
Coupling
Numerical simulations have been used to clarify the mechanism of
magnetic fields in magnetoaerodynamics, such as those for the effect of
magnetic fields on the N2 gas jet shown in Fig. 2-8-1(a). Numerical
simulations^^ are made by solving the Navier-Stokes equations and
inserting the magnetic attractive force acting on O2 gas mixtures. Because
the absolute value of the magnetic susceptibility of paramagnetic oxygen
per unit weight, x^oi is a few hundred times as large as for that of other
diamagnetic gases, the magnetic attractive force acting on a unit volume of
O2 gas mixture is
Fn,-(l/2)^0X;^gO:XrO:XpxV//2 (1)
where jio is the absolute magnetic permeability of a vacuum, Yoi the mass
ratio of O2 gas, p density and H the magnetic field strength.
Figure 2-8-1(c) shows the simulated distribution of the mass fraction
of air {Y^) and the stream function (*fO in the presence of magnetic field
gradients for /doHo= 1.5 T (KA= 0 corresponds to pure nitrogen gas).
Because N2 gas jets are symmetric along the central vertical axis, only half
of the jet is shown. The distribution of FA shows that a long, thin region
about 7.5 cm long along the v axis is occupied by N2 gas. Above 6 cm, the
region that is rich in N2 gas spreads out to both sides, and a recirculation
zone is created. These flow patterns are similar to the flow patterns of the
gas jet shown in Fig. 2-8-1(a). The flow field represented by *F shows that
the air is drawn into the region of higher magnetic field, and as a result, the
N2 stream is pushed out toward the weaker magnetic field by the air and
accelerated. Such behavior of air flow under magnetic field gradients is
also observed using Particle Image Velocimetry flow visualization.^^ On
the other hand, in calculated flow patterns in the absence of magnetic
fields, there is no accelerated N2 gas flow, and no recirculating flows are
generated, consistent with observed flow behavior in the absence of
magnefic fields. A comparison of the flow fields in the presence and
absence of a magnetic field therefore clearly shows that magnetic field
gradients can have a significant effect on gas flows. The calculated N2 gas
velocities increase with increasing //o, which agrees with measured gas

2.8 Magnetic Control of Gas Flow. Combustion and Oxidation Reaction 103
velocities. Thus, the numerical analyses clarify the coupling mechanism
between magnetic forces and convective motion and indicate the existence
of convective flows of gas mixtures due to nonconservative magnetic body
forces.
2.8,2 Magnetic Promotion of Combustion in Diffusion Flames
Magnetic field gradients have also been found to affect combustion.
Instead of N2 gas, fuel gas (methane, 150 cm^ min"') is flowed from a glass
tube (inner diameter: 0.8 cm) the head of which was set at position A, B or
C in the gap of the electromagnet in Fig. 2-8-2(a). When the output is set at
C and a fuel gas flows toward a stronger field, a diffusion flame becomes
an equatorial disc (indicated by the .dotted lines). This phenomenon was
first reported by Faraday.^^ On the other hand, when a flame is positioned
at A and fuel gas flows toward a weaker magnetic field, the flame becomes
shorter, sharper and more brilliant immediately after applying the magnetic
field (indicated by the dotted line) and quickly returns to the original state
after the magnetic field is switched off."^ ^^ The flame temperature increases
rapidly when the magnetic field is turned on, and returns to the original
temperature when it is turned off As shown in Fig. 2-8-2(b), the flame
temperature 1 cm above the burner head increases with increasing
H{dH/dy) and rises by about 120°C at 35 T' m"'. For comparison, when the
flame is placed in a uniform field of 1.5 T (B), no magnetically induced
change is observed in the flame. These results indicate that magnetic
promotion of combustion occurs when fuel gas flows toward a weaker
magnetic field.
This phenomenon can be understood by considering air flow in the
presence of magnetic field gradients. Combustion reaction occurs at the
surface of a diffusion flame, i.e., a reaction zone, and the flame can support
combustion on the earth because natural convection provides O2 gas to and
removes reaction products CO2 and H2O from the reaction zone. The
magnetization force is a body force similar to the gravitational force,
where volume magnetic susceptibility x is analogous to density. Since
paramagnetic oxygen gas obeys Curie's law, x for O2 gas mixture is
X^PXYO,XX,OATRT/T)OCYOJT' (2)
where T is absolute temperature, TRT is room temperature and ;(^g02 is the
magnetic susceptibility per unit mass of oxygen at TKT.
Because combustion accompanies a decrease of O2 and a rise of
temperature, it causes a decrease of x- Therefore, when the flame is placed
at A, the magnetically induced air flow is similar to the N2 gas jet (see
Figs. 2-8-1(a) and (c)). Because the direction of magnetic convection is
upward, the same as for natural convection, magnetic field gradients
promote combustion in diffusion flames. On the other hand, when the
flame is placed at C, magnetic convection acts downward, while natural

--- Page 124 ---

104 2 Effects of Magnetic Force
convection acts upward. The rounded shape of the flame at position C is
caused by the combination of these two types of air flows. Numerical
simulation also explains these magnetically induced phenomena.^^
2.8.3 Magnetic Support of Combustion in Diffusion Flames under
Microgravity Conditions
A. Microgravity Experiment
In diffusion flames, one of the essential elements needed to sustain
combustion is the presence of buoyancy-induced convective air flow,
which affects the heat and mass transfer. In fact, under microgravity
conditions, where buoyancy-induced convection does not occur, diffusion
flames become spherical and less flammable, have low power output and
are eventually extinguished.^^ Magnetic fields can be used to improve
combustion under low gravity conditions by replacing gravity-induced
convection with magnetically-induced convection. The present authors
conducted an experiment to support combustion in diffusion flames in
microgravity using magnetically induced air flows.'^^
We conducted microgravity experiments in a 490-m free-fall shaft at
the Japan Microgravity Center, where 10 sec of microgravity below 10^ G
(9.8 m s"^) was obtained inside a free-fall capsule. Magnetic field gradients
were obtained by using permanent magnets (Nd-B-Fe). To induce upward
magnetic convective air flow, butane was injected upward into air at a flow
rate of 36 cm^ min"', toward a weaker magnetic field. As a control, we also
observed the diffusion flame without magnets.
The diffusion flame in an atmosphere of 50% O2 and 50% N2 is
shown in Fig. 2-8-3. In the absence of a magnet (left-hand pictures), as the
time of microgravity increased, the flame which showed a typical tear-drop
shape in normal gravity became spherical, then invisible 7 sec after the
drop of the capsule and was finally extinguished. On the other hand, the
right-hand set of pictures shows that when permanent magnets were
installed, even before the drop (normal gravity conditions), the flame
became shorter and more brilliant because of magnetic convection. Under
microgravity conditions [(B') and (C)], the flame became shorter and
more brilliant than under normal gravity conditions. Furthermore, the
increased luminosity and shape did not change during microgravity,
indicating that magnetically induced air convection can support
combustion efficiently under microgravity conditions.
B. Numerical Simulation of Magnetic Support of Combustion in
Diffusion Flames under Microgravity Conditions
Numerical simulations were made of axisymmetric, laminar hydrogen
diffusion flames, focusing on the effects of magnetic fields on diffusion
flames under microgravity conditions.^^ At the outlet of the burner, noH =
1.8 T and along the vertical y axis, juo^ H(dH/dy) = -20 T m"^ The

(1996)]
simulations show that under microgravity conditions and in the absence of
magnetic fields, because of the lack of natural convection, combustion
products remain near the diffusion flame and the amount of O2 diffusing to
the flame region is retarded, compared with combustion under normal
gravity conditions. This is why flames cannot support combustion under
microgravity conditions and are eventually extinguished. When a magnetic
field gradient is applied to a diffusion flame, the inhomogeneity of the

--- Page 126 ---

106 2 Effects of Magnetic Force
magnetic susceptibility induces convection near the flame. The flow
configuration formed by the magnetic forces under microgravity
conditions is similar to that under normal gravity conditions without
magnetic fields. In both cases, the temperature contours are also similar to
each other.
2.8.4 Magnetic Promotion and Quenching of Catalytic Combustion
In diffusion flames, the reaction zone is mobile, but in a catalytic
combustion, the reaction zone is fixed, i.e., surface oxidation reactions
occur on platinum catalysts. We studied the effect of magnetic field
gradients on combustion via platinum (Pt) catalyst.'^^ The Pt catalyst
dispersed on glass fibers was set on the head of a vertical glass tube
(internal diameter: 1.2 cm). Catalytic combustion occurs at the Pt catalyst
dispersed glass fibers (we call this area the "reaction zone"). Methane gas
flowed upward through the tube at 34 cm"^ min"', and oxygen gas was
supplied from the surrounding air. The reaction zone was placed at either
position A or C in the gap of the electromagnet in Fig. 2-8-2(a). The
progress of the catalytic combustion was determined by measuring the
temperature of the reaction zone with an infrared thermometer.
When the reaction zone was located at A in Fig. 2-8-2(a), the reaction
zone temperature increased rapidly in accordance with the field exposure,
but returned to normal within a few seconds after the field was turned off.
The temperature increased with increasing absolute value of H(dH/dy) at
the catalyst, and the maximum increase in temperature was about SO^'C. In
contrast, when the reaction zone was located at position C in Fig. 2-8-2(a)
and the methane flow rate was 50 cm^ min"', the temperature decreased
with increasing absolute value of //(d///dy), and the maximum decrease
was about 55°C.
Magnetic promotion and quenching can be explained by considering
the effect of the magnetization forces on the movement of reactants and
reaction products to and from the reaction zone. When the reaction zone is
set at A in Fig. 2-8-2(a), the supply of air to the catalyst increases because
of the magnetic attractive forces. Furthermore, the diamagnetic reaction
products are removed from the surface of the catalyst because of magnetic
buoyancy forces. On the other hand, when the catalyst is set at C, the
direction of the magnetic forces is reversed and the reaction is
magnetically quenched. Thus, catalytic combustion can be promoted or
quenched by applying magnetic field gradients. These results suggest a
new method for efficiently controlling catalytic reactions involving O2 gas.
2.8.5 Magnetic Effects on Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Fuel
Cells
One promising application of magnetoaerodynamics is the promotion of
the cathode reaction in fuel cells. In a proton exchange membrane (PEM)

--- Page 127 ---

2.8 Magnetic Control of Gas Flow, Combustion and Oxidation Reaction 107
fuel cell, the cathode is made of a porous carbon electrode and the catalyst
layer where Pt catalysts are dispersed, and the following cathode reaction
proceeds via a platinum catalyst:
02-f-4H^ + 4e->2H20 (3)
In this reaction, the reaction product is water and the transport of O2
gas to the reaction site, the Pt catalyst, is caused by diffusion process.
Therefore, the transport of O2 gas is the major rate-limiting process, and
thus causes high overpotential and loss of efficiency of the system. We
examined the effect of magnetic field gradients on cathode reactions.^^^^^
In a fuel cell experiment, we used strong permanent magnets (Nd-Fe-B).
When the cathode was placed on the disc of a permanent magnet, steep
magnetic field gradients were created on the cathode and O2 gas moved
toward a stronger field, as shown in the upper left part in Fig. 2-8-4. The

magnetic field gradient was controlled by changing the thickness of the
magnet. For the cathode, a Pt dispersed carbon paper (20 mass% Pt/C, 1.0
mg cm~^ PtA^ulcan XC-72, Electrochem. Inc.) impressed with 1.3 mg cm'^
of Nafion polymer was tested. The three-electrode glass cell was used for
the electrochemical experiments (see upper right in Fig. 2-8-4). In this
apparatus, the working electrode was partially immersed in 0.05 mol dm"^
H2SO4 solution in a vertical position and rotated at a rate of 0.81 rpm.
The lower part of Fig. 2-8-4 shows the polarization characteristics at
various magnetic field gradients. In the absence of the magnet field (a), as
the absolute value of voltage increases, the current saturates to a peak
value. However, when the cathode is placed on a permanent magnet (see
(b)-(d)) the current increases almost linearly with increasing absolute value
of voltage, and the current is enhanced by increasing /uo^ H(dH/dy).
However, it is impossible to set a block of permanent magnet behind
the cathode electrode in a fuel cell system. Recently, when small
permanent magnet particles were incorporated into the cathode catalyst
layer and magnetized, improvement in the fuel cell performance was
observed compared with one without magnetization.'"^^ The magnetic
promotion of fuel cell cathode reactions can also be explained by the
magnetically induced movement of O2 gas and the reaction product H2O to
and from the reaction zone. Recent numerical simulations also show such a
mechanism.'"^ ^^^ In PEM fuel cells, one of the main factors that limit fuel
cell performance is sluggish O2 reduction. Our study suggests a new
method to improve the efficiency of O2 reduction.
2.8.6 Conclusions and Future Prospects
In the 20th century, Pauling et al.'^^ invented the equipment to measure the
concentration of O2 gas using magnetic attractive force toward O2 gas, and
the Pauling oxygen analyzer has been widely used. However,
magnetoaerodynamics is still in the stage of basic research. Oxygen gas is
very important for humankind, essential for oxidation and reduction
reactions, combustion, breathing, etc. The magnetic effects introduced in
this section can be obtained using strong permanent magnets. The
development of magnetoaerodynamics will provide new methods to
control air flow, combustion and chemical reactions involving O2.

Effects of Lorentz Force and Magnetohydrodynamic
Effects
Magnetic field effects (MFEs) based on Lorentz force clearly
appear in electrochemical reactions and they have been
investigated as magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects for
electrolysis. But new aspects of MFEs have been appearing as a
result of microscopic investigations under the influence of high
magnetic fields. In this chapter, we describe the novel
phenomena and mechanisms of magneto-electrochemical
processing, metal deposition under magnetic fields, the
magnetic induction of morphological chirality and metal
shaping with alternating magnetic fields.
3.1 Magneto-electrochemical Processing
For magneto-electrochemical processing, it is important to utilize field
forces induced by magnetic fields. Under magnetic fields, electrochemical
systems receive various forces, which are mainly classified into three
kinds, i.e., Lorentz force, heterogeneous and homogeneous magnetic
forces. Lorentz force is induced by the interaction between electrolytic
current and magnetic field; the force per unit volume is expressed by
fi=IxB, where T is the current density, and B is the magnetic flux
density. Heterogeneous magnetic force generated in a heterogeneous
magnetic field is expressed by differentiating the magnetic energy stored in
electrolyte solution per unit volume, i.e., fhe = (1 / 2)( j / jUo)V|5|\ where x is
the magnetic susceptibility, /Uo the magnetic permeability and V the
differential operator with regard to the position. Homogeneous magnetic
force emerges in a homogeneous magnetic field, written as fho =
(l/2)(|5f/AXo)V;f.
In electrochemical reactions, Lorentz force is generally predominant,
so that the effects induced by Lorentz force, i.e., magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) and micro-MHD effects have been studied from the beginning.'^^
Effects in heterogeneous magnetic fields can be observed when MHD and
micro-MHD effects are neglected.^^ Homogeneous magnetic force is the
weakest among them, so few studies have been reported.^^ Therefore, in

--- Page 131 ---

112 3 Effects of Lorentz Force and MHD
this section, MHD and micro-MHD effects are first discussed, followed by
examination of the effects on the heterogeneous force.
3.1.1 Application of Lorentz Force
A. MHD Electrode
For the analysis of electrochemical reaction in a magnetic field, an
electrode system called the MHD electrode is used. Fig. 3-1-1 is a
schematic drawing of the MHD electrode, which is composed of a
rectangular channel with two open ends. On the inner walls of the channel,
a pair of electrodes each with the same area is placed face to face, i.e., one
is the working electrode and the other is the counter electrode, and
electrolytic current flows between them. The electrode potential of the
working electrode is regulated by a reference electrode inserted from
behind through a Luggin capillary. Magnetic field is applied vertically to
the current, i.e., in parallel mode to the electrode, so that Lorentz force is
generated along the channel, and as shown in Fig. 3-1-1, the solution
inside the channel starts to move along the electrodes. Momentum balance
of the induced fluid motion is expressed by the following Navier-Stokes
equation,
^ + (M.V)M=--VP + vV'w + - r x5 (1)
dt p p
where u is the velocity, P the pressure, p the density and v the kinematic
viscosity. The solution flow is called the MHD flow, which is self-
organized through an autocatalytic process between fluid motion and mass
transfer. To see the process comprehensively, first, consider the electrolytic
current flowing by the mass transfer of active species. Mass balance of
active ionic species in the presence of a large amount of supporting
to potentiostat

dt
Current density at the electrode is, from Pick's first law, the y-component
vertical to the electrode, which is given as
where Zm is the charge number, F the Faraday constant, D the diffusion
constant and C the concentration of active species. Therefore, by the
Lorentz force per unit volume iB, the solution, according to Eq. (1), starts
to flow in the velocity u along the electrode, where B is the z-component of
the magnetic flux density and u is the jc-component of the velocity. On the
other hand, the flowing solution enhances the mass transfer, so that the
concentration of the active species changes according to Eq. (2). The
concentration gradient {dC/dy)^.^^ together with the velocity u also
increases. As a result, the current density / in Eq. (3) again increases. All
these processes are cycled until the steady state is achieved. In the case
where the channel height and the velocity are large, the flow mode
becomes inviscid, so that the average current density is given by^^

As discussed above, MHD flow moves in quite a different mode from
the fluid motion driven by mechanical force. For example, in the rotating
disk electrode, the solution velocity is one-sidedly determined by external
mechanical force, whereas the velocity of MHD flow is controlled in close
relation to electrode reactions.
In the vicinity of the electrode, MHD flows contain minute vortex

114 3 Effects of Lorentz Force and MHD
Structures called "micro-MHD flows," which are a kind of nonequilibrium
fluctuation of MHD flows. Therefore, the micro-MHD flows can interact
with other nonequilibrium fluctuations such as concentration fluctuation,
so that electrode reactions receive specific effects called the micro-MHD
effects from micro-MHD flows. The most important point is that although
micro-MHD flows affect the mass transfer of active species, the mass
transfer process is not always promoted, but sometimes suppressed. If the
reaction contains some autocatalytic process of nonequilibrium
fluctuations, such fluctuations are often suppressed by the micro-MHD
flows, and the total reaction rate decreases.
B. Micro-MHD Effects
a. Electrodeposition in parallel magnetic fields
In electrodeposition, it is known that two kinds of nonequilibrium
fluctuations play important roles, i.e., asymmetrical and symmetrical
fluctuations yield two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D)
nuclei, respectively.^^^ As shown in Fig. 3-l-2(a), asymmetrical
fluctuations arise in the electric double layer and fluctuate one-sidedly to a
specific side of the electrostatic equilibrium where the reaction proceeds.^^
As a result of electrode reaction, a diffusion layer is formed, and
symmetrical fluctuations occur simultaneously, so that, as shown in Fig. 3-
l-2(b), the fluctuations change around their average values. After charging
the electric double layer, with the developing diffusion layer, symmetrical
fluctuations are promoted. Micro-MHD flows interact with symmetrical
fluctuations, so that the 3D nucleation is markedly affected by a magnetic
field.
In the MHD electrode, for a magnetic field parallel to the electrode

3.1 Magneto-electrochemical Processing 115
surface, numerous micro-vortexes appear along the MHD flow.^^ As shown
in Fig. 3-1-1, in the MHD electrode, the solution flows along the channel
by the Lorentz force induced in the magnetic field. The micro-MHD flows
in this case take the forms of minute rollers traveling along the electrode
surface. These numerous rollers, in a manner, crush the nonequilibrium
fluctuations accompanied by nucleation, and level the deposit surface. In
electrodeposition, active species of ions are transported through a diff'usion
layer and an electric double layer onto the electrode surface.^^ After
dehydrating, the active species receives electrons at the surface, being
adsorbed on the surface as adatoms. Then the adatoms diffuse along the
electrode surface according to the local difference of their chemical
potential. Finally, after traveling to unstable sites, the adatoms are
incorporated into the substrate as lattice atoms. Such incorporation also
occurs during surface diffusion. A series of nucleation generates
symmetrical concentration fluctuation in the diffusion layer. This type of
fluctuation, as mentioned above, takes positive and negative values, and in
this sense, has symmetry. In the limiting-diffusion case, symmetrical
fluctuations interact with micro-MHD flows. The important point is that
the nucleation itself is controlled by the symmetrical fluctuations.
Therefore, if the growth of symmetrical fluctuations is suppressed, crystal
growth is also suppressed. In contrast, in the absence of interaction, the
growth of symmetrical fluctuation is promoted, so crystal growth is also
promoted.
Furthermore, to quantify the leveling process of deposit by magnetic
field, the spatial power spectrum was theoretically derived for the surface
morphology of deposit in the MHD electrode.^^ The spectrum indicates the
existence ratios of the crystal grains with the diameters corresponding to
the reciprocals of the wave numbers. The intensity of the spectrum
decreases with magnetic flux density; the wave number receiving
suppression is in the range of 10^ m~\ which means that crystal grains of
the order of 1 ^m are the most markedly suppressed by the micro-MHD
flows.
b. Electrodeposition in vertical magnetic fields
In a vertical magnetic field, since almost all current lines are parallel to the
magnetic field, it has been thought that MHD effect can be neglected.
However, actually, as shown in Fig. 3-1-3, the electrode vertical to a
magnetic field called the "vertical MHD electrode," yields characteristic
deposits with regular holes called "micro-mystery circles."'^^ This is
because the same macro- and micro-MHD flows as those in corrosion and
electroless plating are generated by asymmetrical and symmetrical
fluctuations. Interaction between the two kinds of flows involving
nonequilibrium fluctuations leads to the partial suppression of deposition,
yielding the characteristic holes. For a micro-electrode in the absence of
the micro-MHD effect, the current density is enhanced by a tornado-like

where y is the cell constant, rj the viscosity, R the electrode radius and AC
the concentration difference between the bulk and the surface. By using
this type of electrode in copper deposition from an acidic copper sulfate
solution, a single mystery circle was observed/^
c. Metal corrosion
Metal corrosion is also accompanied by nonequilibrium fluctuations, i.e.,
asymmetrical and symmetrical fluctuations, which are characteristic to
metal corrosion.^'^ In metal corrosion under magnetic field, total corrosion
rate is suppressed. ^^'^^ Fig. 3-1-4 shows copper plates dipped in nitric acid
solution under a vertical magnetic field. In the absence of a magnetic field,
the copper plate is attacked by nitric acid, and almost all the original shape

is lost, whereas in a high magnetic field, the plate retains its original shape.
This is called magnetic protection of corrosion.
It is well known that metal corrosion proceeds by the coupling of
anodic metal dissolution and cathodic reduction of acid or oxygen, which,
from an electrochemical viewpoint, is regarded to be the formation of a
local cell composed of two partial reactions. Corrosion proceeds in the
numerous local cells formed on a metal surface. In each cell, a circular
current flows between the anodic and cathodic sites, and some part of the
current leaks into the solution. This leaking current induces a local Lorentz
force, so that on the metal surface, numerous minute vortexes, i. e., micro-
MHD flows, are formed, which appear in a magnetic field vertical to the
metal surface. The micro-vortexes come from symmetrical fluctuations,
whereas the macroscopic rotations can be attributed to asymmetrical
fluctuations. The latter motion often generates much larger scale motion
than the former.
Copper dissolution in nitric acid solution proceeds with the
autocatalytic attack of nitrate ions against a copper surface. In the case of a
sufficiently high concentration of nitric acid, copper dissolution is rate-
determining, so that the micro-MHD flows interfere with nonequilibrium
fluctuations and suppress corrosion itself. It is theoretically predicted that
the corrosion rate decreases in proportion to the -2/3 power of magnetic
flux density. When the concentration of nitric acid is sufficiently low, nitric
acid reduction is rate-determining. Since nitric acid reduction is not
autocatalytic, the micro-MHD flows cannot suppress the total reaction but
act to enhance the corrosion rate. As expected in this discussion, the
corrosion rate increases in proportion to the 1/2 power of magnetic flux
density.
Zinc powder dissolution in sulfuric acid solution was also carried out
under vertical magnetic field.'^^ Zinc powder was mixed with 0.5 mol dm'^
sulfuric acid + 1 mol dm~^ sodium sulfate solution under magnetic fields of
up to 10 T. As a result, after floating on the solution surface, each zinc
particle independently started to circulate in a given diameter, i.e, several
mm at 10 T. The velocity was proportional to the applied magnetic flux
density. In this case, at the anodic site, zinc dissolved, whereas at the
cathodic site, hydrogen gas evolved, so that local cells formed on the
particles. It was concluded that the induced Lorentz force makes each
particle circulate,
d. Electroless plating
The same situation as described above also exists for electroless plating.
Both metal corrosion and electroless plating are complex reactions in
which cathodic and anodic partial reactions proceed simultaneously.
Electroless plating proceeds by a similar local cell mechanism, i.e., metal
reduction and reagent oxidation occur at cathodic and anodic sites,
respectively. In this case, due to leaking circular currents, micro-MHD

volume ratio of 5:1, maintaining a temperature of 40°C. The plating time was 20 min. The
diameter of the circular Pt plate was 1 mm.
[Reproduced from Y. Oshikiri et al., Jpn. J. Appl. Phys., 43, 3599 (2004)]
flows also play an important role. As a result, when the autocatalytic
process of electroless plating is suppressed by the micro-MHD flows,
decrease in crystal grain size is observed. In Fig. 3-1-5, the grain sizes in
the vertical magnetic field of 5 T actually decrease in comparison with
those in zero magnetic field.^^^
Electroless plating onto metal powder under a vertical magnetic field
yields the same type of motion as that in the dissolution of zinc powder
under a vertical magnetic field. For silver-displacement plating onto
copper particles, copper powder was mixed with silver nitate solution
under vertical magnetic fields of up to 10 T.'^^ Immediately after injecting
a silver nitrate solution into a vessel filled with copper powder, thus
dispersing the powder in the solution, the particles started to circulate
along the vessel under vertical magnetic field with sudden changes in
direction. The velocity of the motion increased with the magnetic flux
density although the deposition rate remained constant. In this case, the
specific motion can also be attributed to induced Lorentz force.
3.1.2 Application of Heterogeneous Magnetic Force
A. Magneto-convection
In a concentrically heterogeneous magnetic field, paramagnetic materials
receive concentric magnetic forces. Paramagnetic liquid placed between a
pair of circular plates with a narrow gap moves concentrically outward.
This phenomenon was applied to the measurement of magnetic
susceptibility of a small amount of liquid.'^^ A vertical magnetic field
generates magneto-convection together with the mass transfer of
paramagnetic species in liquid phase. For example, it is known that
dissolution of oxygen gas into water is promoted by magneto-

convection/^^ Recently, oxygen dissolution into aqueous phase enhanced
by magneto-convection has been theoretically and experimentally
analyzed, and a simple mass transfer equation was formulated.'^^ In this
case, it was assumed that at a gas-liquid interface, the vertically applied
magnetic field concentrically takes on a parabolic distribution.'^^

In a vertical magnetic field without any horizontal distribution,
another type of magneto-convection is observed. In the dissolution process
of copper-sulfate pentahydrate, due to dissolved paramagnetic cupric ions
with paramagnetism, the heterogeneous magnetic force is generated, so
that, as shown in Fig. 3-1-6, numerous minute convection cells appear in
front of the dissolved crystal surface. This type of convection cell is quite
different from the micro-MHD flows; the flow mode is nonvortex and
somewhat similar to gravitational convection cells.'^^ The resulting
magneto-convection promotes the mass-transfer rate of cupric ions,

B. Spin Electrode
In electrochemical reactions under a magnetic field, as discussed above,
MHD and micro-MHD flows are predominant due to electrolytic current.
Therefore, it is thought that magneto-convection can be observed only
when the MHD and micro-MHD effects are neglected. If a micro-electrode
of appropriate diameter is used, such a condition is easily achieved. The
electrolytic current of magneto-convection was measured in a ferricyanide-
ferrocyanide reaction with the current density expressed by^^
r = 0.0969z.FDf-L-rf|5l""'|Aq«^-^'^ ^
"aiy ""
where x is the difference of the magnetic susceptibility between the
product and the reactant. In this case, the change in magnetic susceptibility
in the reaction can be measured in the form of electrolytic current. In
electrochemical reactions, electron transfer accompanying reactions often
changes the electron-spin state of reactants. For transition metal
complexes, it is well known that the electron-spin number is proportional
to the value of magnetic susceptibility. Therefore, from the measurement
of electrolytic current, the change in electron-spin number in an electrode
reaction can be determined. Recently, it has been ascertained that a special
electrode with a sheath called a "spin electrode" is quite effective for
measuring magneto-convection in electrode reactions.^^^

3.2 Magnetic Field Effects in Silver Metal Deposition
The metal dendrite is generated through redox reactions at interfaces
between metal surfaces and solutions. Since the reaction proceeds in the
non-equilibrium state, the shape, pattern, distribution, growth rate and
yield of the dendrites are affected by small perturbations such as magnetic
force or Lorentz force.'^^ The dendrites obtained show various patterns
depending on the growth conditions: whether the reaction system is three-
dimensional or two-dimensional and whether the redox reaction contains
paramagnetic species or only diamagnetic species.
Our group investigates magnetic field effects on the growth of silver
metal dendrites, which are observed in three-dimensional systems and in
two-dimensional systems on a plane parallel to the magnetic field direction
under vertical or horizontal and inhomogeneous magnetic fields.^'^^ We
present some reaction systems and interesting results below.
3.2.1 A Three-dimensional Reaction System: Copper Metal-Silver Ion
System^ ^^
When a paramagnetic species contributes to a reaction system, how is the
three-dimensional dendrite affected? This reaction is given by the
following equation.
2Ag^ + Cu->2Ag>L+Cu'^ (1)
The reaction proceeds due to the ionization tendency, and without
electrolysis. The copper ion is the only paramagnetic species in this
reaction.
Figures 3-2-l(a)-(d) show the photographs of silver dendrites after
two hours reaction under various vertical magnetic fields (three vessels are
placed in the vertical bore tube, and one vessel is placed outside the bore
tube. The positions are designated "top" (9.3 T, 980 T^ m'), "middle"
(15 T, -160 T' m-^), "bottom" (5.6 T, -940 T- m"^) as observed from the
top of the vertical bore, and "outside" (< 0.005 T). The magnetic field

clearly caused dramatic changes in the color and shape of the silver
dendrites. The dendrite grown at zero field shows tree-like branches with
metallic silver (Fig. 3-2-1(a)). In contrast, the shape and color of the
dendrites changed remarkably under the magnetic field. The color changed
from a metallic color to gray or black. The shape changed from tree-like
dendrites to spherical ones (Figs. 3-2-1(b), (c) and (d)).
The micrography of the dendrites grown under each condition was
observed. The dendrites grown "outside" the bore show metallic color and
tree-like shape a few millimeters in length. In contrast, the dendrites
generated under the magnetic field had a shape similar to those at zero
field, although their size was about 10 times smaller than those grown at
zero field. These findings indicate that the growth of the dendrites occurs
very fast under a magnetic field. The dendrites are black or dark gray in
color, since the incident light is reflected many times by the small-size
dendrites.
The time evolution of the copper ions generated through the reaction
(1) was investigated. It was found clearly that the reaction occurs
remarkably fast due to the magnetic field. Detailed investigation showed
that the time evolution of the copper ions is sensitive to both magnetic
force and magnetic field intensity. The rise time and equilibrium
concentration clearly corresponds to the magnetic condition. In order to
estimate reaction rate constants semi-quantitatively, the time dependence

of the yields is fitted tentatively with a single exponential function (2),
although this reaction is not a first-order reaction;
A(0 = A(-){l-exp(-^r)} (2)
where A(t) and A(oo) are the concentration of copper ion at time t and
infinite time, respectively, and k is the rate constant. The results of the
fitting parameters, the rate constants k and the concentration at infinite
time A(oo) are described as follows; ''outside": 1.06 x 10"^ min"^ and 0.013

field is maximum but the magnetic gradient is nearly zero, shows the
maximum value, the equilibrium value is the minimum among the various
magnetic conditions. This indicates two mechanisms, that is, magnetic
force (FM) and Lorentz force (FL), contribute to the reaction, as described
by the following equations.

The copper ions promote working of the magnetic force FM effectively. In
a vertical magnetic field, the magnetic force FM works along the vertical
direction. Therefore, the convection due to the magnetic force FM occurs
vertically. On the other hand, the concentration of all ionic species
promotes working of the Lorentz force FL. The FL works on the plane
which is vertical to both v and B. Therefore, the convection due to the
Lorentz force FL occurs horizontally. The ratio of the magnetic force and
Lorentz force consequently depends on the gradient of the magnetic field
and the concentration of copper ion.
Based on the result of the time evolution, let us consider how the
magnetic field affects the redox reaction. The concentration of silver ions
in bulk is very high and that of copper ions is very low at an early reaction
time of up to 20 min. Consequently the rise rate at the middle position is
much larger than at the other positions. However, after 20 min, as the

--- Page 143 ---

124 3 Effects of Lorentz Force and MHD
concentration of copper ion increases, the magnetic force begins to
contribute to the convection. The convection due to the magnetic force is
effective for the reaction, and therefore, the equilibrium concentration
becomes large.
Figures 3-2-l(e)-(h) give a rough illustration of the convection at
each condition. The reaction proceeds from diffusion and gravity without
the magnetic field, hence the convection does not occur effectively (Fig. 3-
2-1(e)). The Lorentz forces work as long as ionic species exist in the vessel
with the magnetic field. When the concentration of copper ions is not
sufficient to generate the magnetic force, the horizontal convection due to
the Lorentz force occurs as shown in Fig. 3-2-1(g). Because the Lorentz
force increases in proportion to the magnetic field intensity, the middle
position, where the magnetic field intensity is maximum, shows a quick
rise. The concentration of copper ions increases with the progression of the
reaction, becomes sufficient to generate magnetic force, which gives rise to
the vertical convection shown in Figs. 3-2-1(f) and (h). The convection
occurs vertically and over a large region of the vessel especially at the top
position (Fig. 3-2-1(h)). For example, the magnetic force on the copper ion
at the top position (5.6 T, -940 T^ m"') is estimated to be -1.48 x lO'*
Nmol ^ This is large enough to cause convection in solution. Therefore,
the reaction is promoted remarkably at a later reaction time.
Thus growth of three-dimensional dendrites is affected by both
Lorentz force and magnetic force; the former is effective early in the
reaction time while the latter is effective later in the reaction time. The
time the two forces work in the reaction depends on the concentration of
the paramagnetic species, that is, the copper ion, and the reaction rate and
efficiency depend on the magnetic field intensity and magnetic gradient.
3.2.2 Two-dimensional Reaction Systems^'^^
In the three-dimensional system mentioned above, both the magnetic force
FM and the Lorentz force FL contribute to the growth of dendrites. For
simplification we investigated a two-dimensional system instead of a
three-dimensional one. Since almost all motion of ion species acts parallel
to the magnetic field direction, the contribution of the Lorentz force will
decrease relatively. We study the following two reaction systems.
2Ag^ + Cu->2Ag>l-fCu-" (1)
2 Ag^ + Zn -^ 2 Ag i + Zn"^ (5)
Reaction (1) has been mentioned above as a three-dimensional reaction
system. Moreover, reaction (5) contains only diamagnetic species. We
show dendrites produced through the reactions with a magnetic field, and
compare reaction (1) with reaction (5) in vertical and inhomogeneous
magnetic fields.

3.2 Magnetic Field Effects in Silver Metal Deposition 125
A. Copper Metal-Silver Ion System
In this section, we present the results of experiments using the copper
metal-silver ion reaction in vertical and inhomogeneous magnetic fields. This
reaction system contains a paramagnetic species, that is, copper ion. The
magnetic force on copper ion will be effective. How do the results differ
from those of the three-dimensional system?
Figure 3-2-2 shows the silver dendrites which grow from the copper
metal-silver ion system with or without the vertical and inhomogeneous
magnetic field. The appearance of all dendrites showed metallic and bright
color. However, the distribution of the dendrites changed remarkably
depending on the magnetic field. The dendrites outside grew more on the
upside than on the downside (Fig. 3-2-2(a)). The tendency became more
remarkable at the bottom position (Fig. 3-2-2(b)). In contrast, a completely
opposite distribution was observed at the top position (Fig. 3-2-2(d)).
According to the SEM images, the dendrites growing outside showed
hexagonal crystal faces of micrometer size. In contrast, the dendrites
growing at the middle position consisted of dendrites of varying
micrometer size, and their crystal faces were not observed clearly. The
results imply that there was not enough time for the growth of crystal faces
under the magnetic field, and that the dendrites grown under a magnetic
field grow much faster than those grown without a magnetic field.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the dendrites grown with
and without a magnetic field were somewhat different from each other.

The values of the diffraction angle (2^) at the outside were the same as
those of pure silver metal. However, the ratio of the intensities was
different from that of a powder. In almost all cases, only one peak was
observed, and this was assigned to the face (111). This indicates that the
hexagonal faces appearing in the SEM image without a magnetic field are
the (111) faces. On the other hand, the pattern observed at the middle was
very similar to the powder pattern. Because fast convection caused by a
magnetic force and a Lorentz force occurs in the solution, the anisotropic
distribution of the crystal faces will be averaged.
It is clear that the dendrites grow slowly and anisotropically without
a magnet field. The pattern of the dendrites is affected by some kinds of
perturbation, that is, gravity and the vertical magnetic field. The upside of
the dendrites outside becomes denser than the downside (Fig. 3-2-2(a)).
Sawada et al. reported that the diffusion field near dendrites was sensitive
to a gravitational force.^ ^^ This indicates that the distribution of the silver
dendrites deviates from equality due to gravity. In contrast, they grow
quickly and isotropically with a magnetic field because of the convection
caused by the magnetic force and/or Lorentz force. The magnetic forces on
the copper ions are very effective as described above. It is well known that
the non-equilibrium state is very sensitive to perturbation due to a
magnetic field. As the copper ion-rich solution near the copper sheet
moves out by magnetic force, a fresh silver ion-rich solution is supplied on
the surface of the copper sheet. As a result the redox reaction is effectively
promoted. The distribution of the dendrites depends on the direction of the
magnetic force. Moreover, local Lorentz forces will work around the
dendrites. As a result, pseudo microgravity and overgravity conditions are
provided by the magnetic field.
B. Zinc Metal-Silver Ion System^^^
In this section, we present the results of experiments using the zinc metal-
silver ion system in vertical and inhomogeneous magnetic field. This reaction
system contains only diamagnetic species so the magnetic force is
expected to be ineffective. How do the results differ from those of the
copper metal-silver ion system? Will the magnetic field effectively affect
the diamagnetic reaction system?
Figure 3-2-3 shows the silver dendrites, which are generated from the
zinc metal (thickness: 0.4 mm)-silver ion system with and without the
vertical magnetic field. (The magnetic field condition is the same as that of
the copper metal-silver ion system described in section 3.2.2 A). The
reaction system contains only diamagnetic species. Nevertheless, a
dramatic magnetic effect was observed. At the outside the dendrites on the
upside grew more than those on the downside (Fig. 3-2-3 (a)). This pattern
is similar to that of the copper metal-silver ion system described above. By
contrast, the dendrites in the magnetic field showed unbranched shapes and

were oriented about ± 30 degrees toward the magnetic field axis. The
angles of the dendrites slightly depended on the magnetic field intensity
(1.75-15 T) and magnetic field gradient (29-1500 T' m"'). Moreover, the
concentration of the silver ions and the thickness of the zinc sheet barely
affected the tilt angle.
It is well known that the shape and growth of dendrites are sensitive
to the convection of reaction solutions. Thus, the volume of reaction
solution is an important factor for the growth of dendrites. The thickness of
the zinc sheet corresponds to the volume in our experiment. In the case in
which the thickness was 0.025 mm, the dendrites clearly showed an
orientation of about 30 degrees at both sides under the magnetic field. At
the outside the dendrites grew equally on both sides. This indicates that
gravity and convection are ineffective in this solution: the convection
caused by the Lorentz force will be hardly effective in such a thin solution.
However, a clear magnetic field effect is observed. These observations
indicate that this phenomenon is due to the character of silver crystal itself.
The SEM images showed the remarkable difference of the silver
dendrites' morphology. The dendrites of the outside showed hexagonal
crystal faces of micrometer order. In contrast, those of the middle position
showed dendrites of many micrometers, and their crystal faces were not
observed clearly, indicating that dendrites grow in a magnetic field much
faster than outside. In this case the Lorentz force is the main force working
on the species in the solution because they are all diamagnetic species and
magnetic force is ineffective.

system in a horizontal magnetic field (8 T). The magnetic field direction is perpendicular.
All images were obtained at a rate of 30 frame s"'. The scale bar represents 0.5 mm.
According to the XRD patterns of the silver dendrites grown in and
outside a magnetic field, both diffraction patterns unexpectedly showed
close similarity. The pattern of diffraction angles (29) was the same as that
of pure silver metal powder, but the ratio of the peak intensities was
different from a powder pattern. Only a single peak was observed, and the
peak was assigned to the face (111). Moreover, the dendrites grown under
a magnetic field had almost the same face distribution, although many
small dendrites looked scattered, indicating that the dendrites grow
anisotropically regardless of the magnetic field.
The result of in situ measurement using a fiberscope is very
interesting (Fig. 3-2-4).^^ At an early reaction time of about five minutes,
some dendrites showed precessions during growth. The direction was
determined by the Lorentz force on the silver ions. The precessions
sometimes stopped then started again. By the time the dendrites grew to a
certain size, the precessions occurred. Although the dendrites grow two-
dimensionally parallel to the magnetic field, the micro-MHD mechanism
will be effective in the reaction.^' The infinitesimal existence of a
component moving perpendicular to the magnetic field produces a Lorentz
force and causes precession in the dendrites. This indicates that fast
convection is generated in the solution, and the MHD mechanism due to
Lorentz forces is very effective. The results agree with the SEM picture
which shows dendrites growing very quickly in the magnetic field. The
fast convection is confirmed by an experiment using tracers. However, the
phenomena are not related to the orientation of the dendrites. The
precessions can take any angle, and the phenomenon cannot explain why
the dendrites lean about 30 degrees toward the magnetic field.
Generally, the orientation of materials under magneUc fields is
caused by their magnetic anisotropic character. The anisotropic
characteristics arise from 1) the anisotropy of a component molecule,
complex or cluster, 2) the anisotropy of a crystal (magnetocrystalline
anisotropy)*°^ and 3) the anisotropic shape (shape magnetic anisotropy).^^' '^^
Many observations have been reported on the above mechanisms. For
example, the orientation of organic molecules originates in the first term,^^^

--- Page 148 ---

3.2 Magnetic Field Effects in Silver Metal Deposition 129
that of zinc or bismuth-tin alloy crystal is responsible for the second term^^^
and that of fibers is ascribed to the first and third termsJ^^ In our case,
silver crystal is reported as a face-centered cubic lattice (fee) which is
isotropic. Therefore, the shape magnetic anisotropy of the dendrites is a
possible mechanism. Usually, when a magnetic field is applied to a
material, a certain demagnetizing field emerges in the material. The
direction of the demagnetizing field depends on the shape of the
material.^^' "^ In our experiments, the growth and shape of the silver
dendrites are anisotropic according to the SEM pictures and the XRD
patterns. The demagnetizing field in the silver dendrites will determine the
direction of the dendrites. It is well known that a non-equilibrium state
such as found in the growth of dendrites is very sensitive to perturbation
due to a magnetic field. Although anisotropic growth will contribute to the
orientation, the reason why the dendrites lean toward a certain angle is not
clear, and it is uncertain whether the shape magnetic anisotropy of sub-
micro order size crystal is effective. This mechanism is possible, but
further investigation is required.
3.2.3 Conclusion
A magnetic field remarkably affects the growth, behavior, shape,
distribution and amount of silver dendrites, even if the system contains
only diamagnetic species. For the reaction system with paramagnetic
species, magnetic forces on the species mainly contribute to the reaction.
By contrast, for the reaction system with only diamagnetic species, the
effect of Lorentz forces appears. Even in a two-dimensional system, in
which the main growth direction is parallel to the magnetic field,
precessions of dendrites caused by Lorentz forces are observed. Moreover,
the magnetic field determines the orientation of the dendrites. The
phenomenon occurs as a result of the shape magnetic anisotropy of the
dendrites.
The main magnetic field effects are caused by the magnetic force and
the Lorentz force, and the ratio depends on the reaction conditions. The
dendrites are good probes for the effect of the magnetic field, and magnetic
fields are highly useful in controlling redox reactions at the interface
between liquid/solid phases.

3.3 3D Morphological Chirality Induction Using Magnetic
Fields
One dream of scientists studying magneto-science is the preparation of
chiral molecules using a magnetic field. Recently, a group in Grenoble
reported molecular chirality induction using a high magnetic field,
although efficiency was negligibly small.'^ Another type of chirality
observed in nature is morphological chirality, which is equally interesting
for scientists. The present author and his research group studied three-
dimensional morphological chirality induction of membrane tubes
prepared by a silicate garden reaction using a high magnetic field.^"*^ By
the application of a magnetic field, right- or left-handed helical membrane
tubes can be selectively prepared as well as twisted tubes in a silicate garden
reaction. All the results are interpreted in terms of a boundary-assisted
magnetohydrodynamics (boundary-assisted MHD) mechanism where a
boundary plays an important role in determining the direction of
convection.
3.3.1 Membrane l\ibes Grown along the Inner Surface of a Vessel
The silicate garden reaction is one of the best known reactions often used
for chemical demonstrations to students.^^ When a sodium silicate aqueous
solution is poured on a metal salt crystal, a colloidal semipermeable
membrane, composed of silica and metal hydroxide, is formed on the
crystal surface. Water diffuses osmotically into the space between the
membrane and the crystal surface, dissolving the crystal. As a result of the
osmotic inflow of water, the membrane is ruptured and the solution rich
with metal ions flows out. Then the ions in outflow react with silicate ions
outside the membrane, forming hollow tubes. Because of the different
densities of the aqueous solution outside and inside the tube, hollow tubes
grow upward.
Semipermeable membrane tubes were grown in cylindrical glass
vessels (typical inner diameter, 6-13 mm) in vertical magnetic fields. Fig.
3-3-1 shows membrane tubes prepared from the reaction of sodium silicate
aqueous solution (relative density, 1.06) and magnesium chloride, zinc

sulfate and copper sulfate in magnetic fields. Hereafter membrane tube
names are referred to by the metal ion used. For example, the membrane
tube prepared using zinc sulfate is called the Zn(II) tube. At zero field the
tubes grow upwards. In magnetic fields all the tubes or bundles of tubes
grow helically along the inner surface of the vessel. The pitch of the
heUxes differs depending on the salt used. This happens because growth
rates are different. The direction of the helixes is exclusively right-handed.
In the case of Zn(II) tubes, helixes with diameters of 6 to 25 mm are
prepared. When the magnetic field direction was reversed to the opposite
direction, left-handed helical tubes were obtained in the case of Zn(II) and
Mg(II) membrane tubes.
3.3.2 Membrane T\ibes Grown along the Outer Surface of a Glass
Rod Placed in a Vessel
Since helical tubes grow only on the inner surface of the vessel, it was
examined whether they could grow on the outer surface of a glass rod
placed within a vessel. As expected, Zn(II) membrane tubes grew along the
outer surface of a circular glass rod (20), a square plastic rod (2 mm x
2 mm) and a triangular plastic rod (2 mm x 2 mm x 2.8 mm) in a
magnetic field but the direction of helixes are always left-handed, as shown
in Fig. 3-3-2.^^ When a 300-//m lead of a lead pencil is used, a left-handed
helical membrane tube grows on its outer surface. By simply putting a
glass rod inside a vessel, left-handed helical tubes can be exclusively
obtained on the outer surface of the rod. These observations indicate that
membrane tubes grow very accurately following the shape of the surface.

3.3.3 Tubes Grown Apart from a Vessel Wall
We examined the shape of tubes grown apart from a vessel wall. Fig. 3-3-3
shows Mg(II) and Zn(II) membrane tubes grown apart from the vessel
wall. At zero field they grow almost straight upward. In a magnetic field,
they grow in twisted form. The twist direction is exclusively left-handed,
which is opposite to that of helical tubes grown on the inner surface of a
vessel. A magnetic field also influences the morphology of membrane
tubes grown apart from a wall.

3.3.4 T\ibes Grown in Horizontal Magnetic Fields
The effects of a horizontal magnetic field were also examined using ZnS04
as a crystal/^ When sodium silicate aqueous solution is poured into a
horizontal glass tube (60), Zn(II) tubes mainly grow upward in the tube,
then grow horizontally along the ceiling of the tube at zero field. In the
presence of a horizontal magnetic field of 8 T, they grow circularly along
the inner surface of the vessel, as shown in Fig. 3-3-4. The absence of
helical growth is attributable to the absence of a driving force growing in
the horizontal direction at zero field. Furthermore, a few tubes also grew in
the horizontal direction at zero field. In this case, they grow in a twisted
shape in the magnetic field. Therefore, the effects of a horizontal magnetic
field are essentially similar to those of a vertical field.

horizontal magnetic field (8 T).
3.3.5 In situ Observation of the Motion of the Solution in a Magnetic
Field
In situ observation of the motion of the solution in a magnetic field was
carried out using MgCl2 as a salt by adding tracers such as polyethylene
particles in the solution."^^ At zero field, no convection was observed
regardless of magnesium salts. Only when the salt was added to the
solution and a magnetic field applied was convection of the solution
observed. Typically, the rate of convection was 0.3-2 mm s~^ under the
experimental conditions. The rate of convection is dependent on the
amount of the salt and its direction is dependent on the location of the salt
in the vessel. When salts are placed near the vessel wall, right-handed
convection is induced. When the salt is placed at the center of the vessel,
left-handed convection is induced. In this case, membrane tubes growing
on the salt themselves act as a boundary surface which induces anisotropic
motion of the outflow. From these in situ observations, it is concluded that

--- Page 153 ---

134 3 Effects of Lorentz Force and MHD
the direction of the helix is the same as that of the convection of the
solution.
3.3.6 Mechanism of 3D Morphological Chirality Induction
The above observations can only be explained by the boundary-assisted
magnetohydrodynamics (boundary-assisted MHD) mechanism in which a
magnetic torque on moving ions results in the convection of the solution
whose direction is partly controlled by the relative orientation of the
solution and boundary, in addition to the magnetic field direction.
When it moves in a magnetic field, an ion receives the Lorentz force
FL, given by the following equation:
FL=qvxB (1)
where q is the charge of the ion, v its velocity and B the magnetic field flux
density. In MHD mechanism, the Lorentz force on moving ions in a
solution in a magnetic field results in the convection of the solution
because of collision in the solution. However, in a bulk solution, the
average of the forces is zero, since they move randomly in all directions
and the forces on ions compensate each other. In the boundary-assisted
MHD mechanism, a boundary plays an important role in inducing
anisotropic motion of ions. Although those in a bulk solution can move
freely in all directions, ions near a boundary, i.e., a wall, cannot move
freely because of the restriction posed by the boundary. Then the ions,
moving in an outer radial direction, bounce on the wall to the inner radial
direction and, therefore, the direction of motion becomes anisotropic. As a
result, the motion of ions induced by the Lorentz force becomes
anisotropic near the wall. This anisotropic force on ions induces one-way
convection of the solution near a wall.
In the silicate garden reacUon a metal ion-rich solution in a tube
flows out upward from hollow tubes by osmotic pressure and reacts with
silicate ions in the bulk solution near the exit of the tube. Since the outflow
is rich with negative ions such as sulfate ions, the Lorentz force can affect
the negative ions in the outflow, leading to convection of the solution. Near
the exit of the tube, concentration gradients of silicate ion and zinc ion are
induced as the precipitation of insoluble membrane formation so these ions
diffuse to the exit. Sodium ions diffuse to the outflow along its
concentration gradient. A magnetic field also affects these motions of ions
in solution. However, the speed of the outflow rich with negative ions is
the fastest, compared with the diffusion rates of other ions, because the
solution is continuously pumped out from the tube by osmotic pressure.
Therefore, the effect of Lorentz force on the outflow rich with negative
ions is the largest, leading to the circular convection of the outflow.
Figure 3-3-5 shows schematically the mechanism of helical growth
of a membrane tube. When the tube grows separate from the vessel wall.

the outflow from its open top receives clockwise Lorentz force, viewed
from the top, and clockwise convection of the solution near the tube is
induced. As a result, the tubes are twisted in the clockwise direction (left-
handed direction), as schematically shown in (a). When the tube grows
near the inner surface of a vessel, the direction of the outflow near the wall
is restricted by the wall and the flow to the wall is reflected to the opposite
direction. The direction of the outflow becomes anisotropic. As a result,
counterclockwise circular convection is induced by the Lorentz force and
the tube grows in the counterclockwise direction (right-handed direction)
(b). When a tube grows near the outer surface of a glass rod, the relative
orientation of the outflow and the wall becomes opposite and the left-
handed helical tube grows (c).
In the case of silicate garden reactions a magnetic field affects the
ions in the outflow. The Lorentz force-induced convection is also observed
in the diffusion-controlled redox reaction of silver ion and zinc metal,
forming silver dendrite.^^ Thus, the boundary-assisted MHD mechanism
could be operative generally in liquid/solid reactions where ions in
solution move to the solid surface in a magnetic field. In other words, a
magnetic field may be a useful tool for preparing materials with chiral
morphology.

3.4 Shaping of Molten Metal Using an Alternating Magnetic
Field
The shaping of a molten metal is a well-known function of the alternating
magnetic field. In this section the application of this function to a
continuous casting process in the steel industry is described. The
continuous casting of steel was first introduced successfully by adopting
mold oscillation by Junghhans of Junghhans Schomdorf (Germany) and
Rossi of Allegheny Ludlum Waterviliet (USA) in 1949.'^ Since then it has
strongly been believed that mold oscillation, which makes a mold flux
penetrate into a channel between metal and mold, is indispensable in the
continuous casting of steel.
In this section a new method for the continuous casting of steel
without employing mold oscillation is proposed. In this method mold
oscillation is replaced by electromagnetic force. The possibility was first
examined through a model experiment using molten gallium and tin to
visualize the penetration behavior of the mold flux in the channel. Molten
tin was continuously cast in a copper mold with slits under an intermittent
alternating magnetic field instead of mold oscillation. Furthermore, the
continuous casting of steel without mold oscillation was successfully
demonstrated in a pilot scale experiment by pioneers at POSCO and RIST
(Research Institute of Science & Technology) in South Korea.^^ The results
obtained in the model and pilot experiments are promising, and the
continuous casting of steel without mold oscillation will soon be realized
on a commercial basis.
3.4.1 Concept of Soft Contacting Solidiflcation
In order to improve the surface quality of aluminum in continuous casting,
the basic concept by which an alternating magnetic field with commercial
frequency is applied from the outside of a mold was first proposed by
Vives and Ricou.^^ The concept has been further developed and termed soft
contacting solidification (SCS)^^ for the application of their process to steel
casts. In this process segmented mold is used and a higher frequency
alternating magnetic field than for the commercial frequency is applied. A
brief explanation of the concept of SCS is as follows. As shown in Fig. 3-
4-1, when an electric current is applied to a coil, a magnetic field is
generated around the coil and induces an electric current in a segmented
mold with slits, which generates another magnetic field in a molten metal,
as if the magnetic field generated around the coil penetrates into the
molten metal through the segmented mold. The magnetic field induces
electric currents in the molten metal thus generating an electromagnetic
force (Lorentz force) in the molten metal by the action of the magnetic
field and the induced electric current. The segmented mold is used is to
concentrate the magnetic field around the molten metal. The

electromagnetic force enlarges the channel of the mold flux between the
metal and the mold, increases the flow rate of the mold flux and at the
same time reduces the contact pressure in the mold flux between a
solidified shell and the mold. Furthermore, Joule heat generated by the
induced current retards solidification of the flux existing in the channel and
accelerates the heat transfer between the solidifying shell and the mold.
3.4.2 Soft Contacting Solidification without Mold Oscillation
(SCSMO)'^
The concept of SCS was first realized in an international project supported
by the former Ministry of Trade and Industry of Japan^^ and also
independently by POSCO.^^ In this section, the work done by Park et al. at
RIST and POSCO in which a high frequency alternating magnetic field
was employed on the continuous casting of steel without mold oscillation
is introduced.
The amount of mold powder consumed in the SCS operation is
shown in Fig. 3-4-2 for various casting conditions in comparison with a
conventional method. The mold powder consumption in the SCS operation
without mold oscillation was no less than that in conventional casting.
Figure 3-4-3 shows typical billet surface aspects for various coil
currents. In the case in which the coil current is 0 A, i.e., conventional
casting, billets had oscillation marks (OSMs) of normal depth in the range
of 0.45 ± 0.15 mm. When the coil current is 500 A, the OSM are

When the coil current is 1000 A, the OSM appears everywhere with a
depth of 0.10 ± 0.04 mm. When the coil current increases to 1200 A, the
OSMs appear again like wave marks with depth of 0.18 ± 0.05 mm.
Generally speaking, we believed that mold oscillation was

indispensable in the continuous casting of steel. However, the SCS
operation increases consumption of the mold flux as shown in Fig. 3-4-2,
suggesting that continuous casting of steel without mold oscillation may be
possible. The photograph shown in Fig. 3-4-4 is the surface aspect of the
billet cast without mold oscillation conducted under a coil current of
1000 A. The surface quality was greatly improved to a roughness of within
0.1 mm, and better than that of the billets cast with mold oscillation shown
in Fig. 3-4-3. This suggests that continuous casting of steel without mold
oscillation may be possible using the SCS operation even on a commercial
scale.

Magneto-thermodynamic Effects
The magnetic energy of a substance is usually very much
smaller than the thermal energy at room temperature or
activation energy in a chemical reaction. Therefore, for many
years it was believed that magnetic field could not affect
chemical equilibrium. However, this is not always correct.
Magnetic energy is proportional to the square of magnetic flux
density. Thus the physical and chemical phenomena which
cannot be observed at 1 T become observable at 10 T, especially
when ferromagnetic substances are involved.
In this chapter, MFEs on hydrogen reaction with metals
and martensitic transition of ferrous alloys, magnetic treatments
of ferromagnetic alloys and magnetic controls of diamagnetic
molecular assemblies and gels are described.
4.1 Magnetic Field-induced Effects on Hydrogen Reaction with
Metals
4.1.1 The Metal-Hydrogen System
Some intermetallic compounds and alloys consisting of three-dimensional
transition and rare earth metals uptake reversibly a large amount of
hydrogen.^""^^ Such a metal hydride works as a hydrogen-absorbing alloy
and is used practically as the negative electrode of secondary batteries.
Generally, a cobalt-rich alloy indicates a ferromagnetic property. The
saturation magnetization of the ferromagnetic metal hydride depends
strongly on the hydrogen composition.^^ The equilibrium state changes to
form the hydride with large magnetic moment under the influence of
magnetic fields because the magnetic free energy tends to be stable. In this
section, the magnetic field effects are described for the ferromagnetic
hydride LaCosH, as a typical material of ferromagnetic metal hydride. The
relationships between the chemical equilibrium and the change in magnetic
free energy are investigated theoretically and experimentally.
Hydrogen is stored in and released from the metal hydride of the
coexistence region between low and high concentration hydride phases.

The equilibrium hydrogen pressure increases with increasing hydrogen
composition, but the pressure is almost constant in the two-phase
coexistence region, that is, the plateau pressure becomes almost constant in
the plateau region. On the other hand, the plateau pressure is sensitive to
the temperature and increases with increasing temperature. The linear
relation between the logarithmic equilibrium hydrogen pressure P and the
inversed temperature \IT is explained thermodynamically by the van't
Hoff relation, Eq. (2).
RT R
where R is gas constant and T is absolute temperature. Thermodynamic
parameters A// as the standard change in enthalpy and A5^ as the standard
change in entropy can be obtained experimentally from the gradient and
the cross section of the linear relation.
4.1.2 Magnetic Field Effect on Equilibrium States
The change in magnetic free energy g^""^ in the magnetic field is written as
^c") = 2HOH'^'^^-^^ = 2BAM. (3)
b-a
where Ho is the permeability of a vacuum, H and B are the magnetic field
strength and the magnetic field density, respectively, and m«^'^ and mt^^ are
the saturation magnetization for the solid MH^ and MH^, respectively. The
AMs is defined as the change in magnetization per hydride of 1 kg per
desorbed hydrogen atom of 1 mol. The magnitude of the magnetic field
effect on the chemical equilibrium depends on Eq. (3) for the metal-
hydrogen system. The magnitude of the magnetic field effect on the
chemical equilibrium is determined by the magnitude of AMs and B.
However, the direction of the magnetic field effect is determined only by
the sign of AMs.
Figure 4-1-1 shows the pressure composition isotherm (PCT curve)
and the saturation magnetization of the LaCosHr system at 293 K. The
LaCosH^c system has two plateau regions; the a -1- (3 and (3 + y regions have
a low and high plateau pressures, respectively.^^^ The saturation
magnetization is decreased linearly with increasing hydrogen composition
for each plateau region, as shown by the broken or dotted line in Fig. 4-1-
1. The AMs corresponds to the gradient of the line and the values are equal
to 16.4 and 8.7 JT"' kg-'(molH)-' for the a + p and (3 + y regions,
respectively, at r= 293 K.

and closed circles denote the equilibrium pressure at B = 12 T and B = 0 T at 7 = 293 K.
4.1.3 Magnetic Field Effect on the Electrochemical System
The experimental value g^'"^ in Eq. (3) can be observed directly from the
electrochemical system using the metal hydride electrode. The change in
free energy AG corresponds to the change in the electrode potential A£
according to Eq. (4).
AG = ~2FAE (4)
where F is the Faraday constant. The electrode potential depends strongly
on the temperature, but the change in the electrode potential is independent
of the temperature. According to Eqs. (3) and (4), the change in the
electrode potential is proportional to the magnetic field density,^^
AE = -BAM, I F (5)
In the experiment, the electrochemical cell consisted of the hydride
negative electrode, Ni positive electrode and SSE reference electrode.
They were soaked in acid solution with a thermocouple. Then the magnetic
field was applied up to B = 15 T at constant temperature T = 293 K. The
temporal variations of the magnetic field and the corresponding change in
the electrode potential are shown in Fig. 4-1-2.^^ The equilibrium potential
responding to the applied magnetic field was decreased by AE = -1.6 mV
under the influence of a magnetic field of B = 15 T. Fig. 4-1-3 illustrates
the relationship between the applied magnetic field and the change in the
electrode potential.^^ The change in the potential decreased with increasing
magnetic field. The linear relation was observed in the fields below 10 T,

but the gradient tends to become large in the fields above 10 T. The
observed change in the potential A£ = -1.6 mV at ^ = 15 T did not agree
with the value A£ = -1.0 mV calculated according to Eq. (5) with AMs =
6.4 JT^^kg"^ (molH)"^ The difference between them is due to the increase
in the AMs in high magnetic fields. The value of the saturation
magnetization Ms does not depend on the hydrogen composition and
magnetic field below a few Tesla. However, the magnetic measurement
showed that the AA/s becomes large with increasing magnetic fields above
10 T because of the increase in the Ms. Theoretical values were
recalculated using the averaged Value AMs = 8.7 JT"'kg"^ (molH)"^ in the
magnetic fields and plotted by the broken line in Fig. 4-1-3. Both
decreases in the electrode potential agreed qualitatively. The magnetic field
energy was converted directly into electrochemical free energy.^ '^^

4.1.4 Magnetic Field Effect on Phase Diagram
The PCT curve is an equilibrium phase diagram of the soHd and gaseous
phases. The magnetic field influenced experimentally the PCT curve as
shown in Fig. 4-1-1.^^^ The open circles denote the equilibrium pressure of
LaCo5HX3.6 <x< 4.6) under the influence of a magnetic field of ^ = 12 T.
The PCT curve shifted to the high pressure side. The increase in the
pressure is explained as follows. The change in free energy of the system
consists of that for the solid phase g"""^ and that for the gaseous phase RT
ln(P/Po), In the equilibrium state, the total must be zero at any magnetic
field as described by Eq. (6). Accordingly, the magnetic field effect on the
equilibrium pressure is explained by Eq. (7).
g^-^ + /?rin(^-^j = 0 (6)
{PoJ RT
where P and Po are the equilibrium pressures in the presence and in the
absence of the magnetic field. Eq. (7) means the logarithmic change in the
pressure ratio is proportional to the magnetic field B when the parameter
AMs, the hydrogen composition and the temperature Tare fixed. ^"^'^^
4.1.5 Magnetic Field Effect on Hydrogen Pressure
In the experiment, a large amount of LaCos alloy and a small space of
gaseous phase were prepared; for example, W= 30.9 g and V= 31.9 ml.*^^
The relatively small volume avoids the change in hydrogen composition.
The hydrogen pressure for LaCo5H4.i in the p + y region increased with
increasing magnetic fields, as shown in Fig. 4-1-3. Finally, the hydrogen
pressure of Po= 153.5 kPa increased io P= 186.6 kPa at a magnetic field of
B = 14 T. The pressure was increased by 1.22 times and the logarithmic
pressure change LPC was equal to 0.195. The theoretical LPC was
calculated to be 0.189 according to Eq. (7) with AMs= 16.4 JT-'kg"'
(molH)"' for the p + y region. Both LPC values agreed well. The closed
circles in Fig. 4-1-4 denote the equilibrium points.'^^ These points are
plotted as a function of the magnetic fields in Fig. 4-1-5. A linear relation
between the LPC and the magnetic field was observed below 14 T
according to Eq. (7) as plotted by closed circles in Fig. 4-1-5. The increase
in the equilibrium pressure was investigated for LaCo5H4.2 under the
influence of a high magnetic field of up to 26 T. The equilibrium pressure
was increased by 1.50 times at a magnetic field of 26 T. This increase
corresponded to a decrease in the equilibrium constant of 33%. However,
the gradient increased in high magnetic fields as shown by the closed
squares. The same tendency appeared in the electrochemical system
described in section 4.1.3. It was understood that the reason was the

increase in MlJ^^ The magnetic field effects on the equihbrium pressure
were investigated for other ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic hydride
systems, such as SmCosHi.g, PrCo5H43, GdCo5H25 and Y2C07H2.5, as
shown in Fig. 4-1-5. The magnetic field effects were classified into two
groups according to the direction of the changes in the equilibrium
pressure. The hydrides with positive AA/s showed a positive change in the
hydrogen pressure, as shown by the closed marks. In contrast, the hydrides
with negative AMs showed a negative change in the pressure, as shown by
the open marks.^^ This experiment suggests that equilibrium pressure and
equilibrium constant can be controlled by the magnetic field.

--- Page 165 ---

4.1 Magnetic Field-induced Effects on Hydrogen Reaction with Metals 147
4.1.6 Magnetic Field Effect on Hydrogen Composition
The increase in the pressure is accompanied by the release of hydrogen
from the hydride. The hydride releases hydrogen until the change in the
free energy of the gaseous phase balances the magnetic free energy. When
the volume of the gaseous phase is large enough compared to the small
amount of the hydride, the hydrogen composition of the hydride must be
influenced by the magnetic field. The plateau pressure is not flat but shows
a gradient for the hydrogen composition. The gradient was defined as
plateau factor Fp= d\nP(x)/dx. Assuming a constant plateau factor, the
magnetic field effect on the hydrogen composition is expected to decrease
according to Eq. (8),
2 BAM,
Ax = (8)
F,RT
In the experiment, the magnetization was measured using an
extraction method to determine the hydrogen composition because of the
controlled hydrogen pressure.'^^ The hydrogen composition was estimated
from the relationship between the magnetization and the hydrogen
composition. The hydrogen composition was adjusted to be JC = 1.88 as the
midpoint of the a + p region at a magnetic field of B = 2.0 T at a
temperature of 7= 313.2 K. This initial composition corresponded to the p-
phase mol fraction of k^ = 0.54. Then the stepwise field was applied to the
system up to 14 T under the controlled pressure P = 11.2 kPa. The
hydrogen composition decreased with increasing magnetic field as shown
in Fig. 4-1-6.^^^ Hydrogen was released from the metal hydride in high
magnetic fields and the hydrogen composition of the solid phase shifted
toward the a-rich phase in the a + p region. Under the influence of a
magnetic field of 14 T the hydrogen composition decreased to ^ = 0.96 (k^
= 0.26), and the change in the hydrogen composition reached Ax = -0.92

(A/:p = -0.28) at a magnetic field of J5 = 14 T. The expected value was
calculated to be Ax = -0.89 according to Eq. (8) with AMs = 8.7 JT"'molH''
and Fp = 0.09 for the a + p regions of LaCosHt. The experimental result
agreed with the calculated one. This experiment demonstrates that the
hydrogen composition of the metal hydride is controllable by a magnetic
field.
4.1.7 Magnetic Field Effect on Thermodynamic Parameters
The heat of reaction A//^, the entropy of reaction AS^ and the free energy of
reaction ACf are significant thermodynamic parameters for understanding
metal hydride-hydrogen systems. The magnetic field effect on the free
energy change AG^ has been described above for the electrochemical
system. Therefore, the magnetic field effects on the enthalpy change Mf
and the entropy change A^"^ are discussed here. The thermodynamic
consideration gives rise to the existence of magnetic field effects on the
thermodynamic parameters. The magnetic field effects on the changes in
parameters were concluded as follows,

The values bH and 85 were estimated according to Eqs. (9) and (10) using
the magnetic properties of LaCosH,. The ratios of the parameters FH and Ts
were calculated according to Eqs. (11) and (12) and the results listed in
Table 4-1-1.^^^ For example, the expected value TH was calculated to be
+0.5% at a magnetic field of 28 T according to Eqs. (9) and (11).
Meanwhile, the magnetic field effects on the thermodynamic parameters
were observed experimentally by measurements of the equilibrium
hydrogen pressure in high magnetic fields.'^ ~'^ van't Hoff relations were
measured for the LaCosHx of the a + p and p + y regions at various
temperatures, as shown in Figs. 4-1-7 and 4-1-8.'^^ According to Eq. (2),
the gradient or the cross section gives the parameter Aff or AS^ in zero
field and 6// or 5S in magnetic fields. The value FH was obtained
experimentally to be +0.4% at a magnetic field of 28 T. The experimental
and calculated values agree well, as shown in Table 4-1-1. The magnetic
field effect on the thermodynamic parameters was remarkable for the
LaCosH^c of the p + Y region. However, the negative sign of the magnetic
field effect was opposite to the a + P region reflecting the magnetic

experimental values were observed qualitatively and quantitatively.
In this section, magnetic field effects on chemical equilibria for metal
hydride-hydrogen systems have been discussed. Changes in chemical
equilibrium were explained perfectly by the thermodynamics and magnetic
properties. The magnetic field controls the equilibrium states, such as
electrode potential, pressure, composition and thermodynamic parameters.

4.2 Magnetic Field Controls of Molecular Assemblies and Gels
Various kinds of magnetic fields are available for use in chemistry: steady
magnetic field, gradient magnetic field, pulsed magnetic field and
electromagnetic field, which are homogeneous or inhomogeneous in space
and time. Magnetic fields may affect chemical reactions, chemical
equilibria, structures and physical properties of materials^'^"^^ via direct
effects such as quantum mechanical, thermodynamical and mechanical

effects and indirect effects such as convection, concentration changes and
temperature changes.
The structure of organized molecular assemblies of surfactants and
lipids can be controlled by flow and an electric field. Use of a magnetic
field is also a potential method for aligning molecules and domains; it has
the advantage that any material can in principle be aligned by magnetic
fields. It is well established that diamagnetic assemblies having magnetic
anisotropy will become oriented in a steady magnetic field so as to achieve
the minimum-energy state. Gaffney and McConnell"^^ and Maret and
Dransfeld,^^ using the electron spin resonance (ESR) and the Cotton-
Mouton effect, respectively, showed that phospholipid molecules could be
oriented by a magnetic field. The magnetic orientational energy (Er) of a
diamagnetic lipid domain containing A^ molecules (volume A^v), whose long
molecular axis is at an angle cp io H and which have the diamagnetic
anisotropy, Ax, and the magnetic susceptibility perpendicular to //, x^^ is
given by the following equation^\*
Er =-(//V2)ai+A;fcos»A^v (1)
The long molecular axis of lipid molecules in a domain can be
cooperatively aligned in the direction of averaged (p,^^ when H is as large as
Er that overcomes the thermal energy. For example, orientational effects
are expected when A^ is on the order of 10^ for Aj - -1 x 10^ cm^mol' (for
long chain hydrocarbons) under 10 T and 318 K or when // = 4.0 T for a
200-nm diameter liposome with a 5-nm membrane thickness.^^ Another
example for magnetic field effects on a bilayer membrane comes from the
elastic properties of the membrane. Helfrich predicted theoretically the
magnetic deformadon of phospholipid liposomes from a sphere to an
ellipsoid, which was shown experimentally by Tenforde and Liburdy.^^
In this section, the molecular orientation of diamagnetic organic
molecules, which may lead to the magnetic deformation of micelles and
lipid membranes and the phase shift of surfactant mesophases, is
introduced.
4.2.1 Micelles and Surfactant/Silicate Hybrids under Steady
Magnetic Fields
Amphiphilic molecules will form micelles of various shapes and sizes.
Since rodlike micelles have a persistence length of about 20 nm or are
flexible, long rodlike micelles behave like wormlike micelles. Adding
salicilate ions to a rodlike micellar solution, very long wormlike micelles
or threadlike micelles are formed. The threadlike micelles will be
entangled. Can a steady magnetic field extend the rod and thread and
promote micellar growth?
Amphiphiles also form various mesophases such as hexagonal and
lamellar structures in the higher concentration region. Since mesophases

--- Page 170 ---

152 4 Magneto-thermodynamic Effects
include many molecules, the molecules in the mesophase tend to be
oriented toward a magnetic field. Therefore, surfactant/silicate hybrids
having hexagonal structure were ordered under steady magnetic fields in
order to prepare higher order mesoporous silicas which were prepared by
calcination of surfactant molecules in the hybrids.^^ This method made it
possible to align a silica skeleton through the magnetic orientation of a
surfactant mesophase of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)
used as a template. The mesoporous silicas comprising a honeycomb
structure have homogeneous, straight pores of narrow size distribution.
Therefore, potential materials have been the focus of attention from the
viewpoint of both fundamentals and application. It is, however, desirable
that the oriented domain of a honeycomb structure be much larger than that
of conventionally synthethized mesoporous silicas. In general, however,
since magnetic ordering of surfactant molecular assemblies is reversible,
we must fix the memory under a magnetic field using some method. One
of those methods is the sol-gel method, in which the gradual production of
silicate ions makes it possible for silicate ions to polymerize slowly after
the formation of a surfactant mesophase.^^
A. Magnetic Deformation of Micelles
CTAB forms rodlike micelles in water. The addition of NaBr and sodium
salicylate (NaSal) makes the micelles wormlike (or longer) and threadlike,
respectively. Magnetic fields align rodlike micelles in the parallel direction
and may promote micellar growth.
Light scattering intensity at scattering angle 90° from CTAB/NaBr
and CTAB/NaSal aqueous solutions decreased by applying a 10-T
magnedc field (Fig. 4-2-1). The radius of gyrafion RG of the micelles,
estimated by the angular dependence of light scattering intensity, increased
at more than 5 T. In both systems, the wormlike micelles having RG of
more than 120 nm grew by magnetic fields, i.e., RG of micelles in 50 mM
CTAB and 100 mM NaSal solution changed from 145 nm to 168 nm upon
application of a 10-T magnetic field.
B. Magnetic Control of Surfactant/Silicate Hybrid Structures
The hybrids were prepared from ethanol-water mixtures containing
tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and CTAB at 298 K under magnetic
fields.^^ The acidic and basic systems containing TEOS, H2O, HCl or NH3,
EtOH and CTAB showed one-phase and two-phase regions. A hexagonal
structure developed with a magnetic field in a one-phase system. Fig. 4-2-
2(A) shows an example of the magnetic field effect on a hybrid from a
basic mixed solution. An amorphous-like hybrid at zero field was
transformed into a typical hexagonal phase by a 28-T magnetic field. The
N2 adsorption isotherms for the mesoporous silicas at 77 K and their pore
size distributions were consistent with the XRD patterns, as seen in the

Fig. 4-2-1 Changes in scattering light intensity from aqueous solutions of 20 mM CTAB containing
sodium salicylate with application of magnetic fields.
Steps in Fig. 4-2-2(B). The silicas prepared from hybrids changed from
microporous at zero field to mesoporous ones with increasing magnetic
field. The increase in adsorption of N2 and the step-like increase at around
moderate pressure suggest more homogeneous mesopores in the hexagonal
structure. When hexagonal and lamellar phases coexisted, a 28-T
magnetic field depressed almost perfectly only the growth of a lamellar
phase to lead to a pure hexagonal phase.
By contrast, in two-phase systems the hexagonal structure in the
bottom phase was depressed with increasing magnetic field. The hexagonal
peak intensities in X-ray diffraction (XRD) decreased with increasing
magnetic field, as indicated by the disappearance of the steps in the N2
adsorption isotherms and decrease in pores with increase in magnetic field.
The hexagonal depression was accompanied by composition changes in
the bottom (hexagonal) and upper (lamellar) phase.
The great dependence of the magnetic field-induced structural
changes on the compositions seems to arise from the stability and domain
size of the surfactant mesophases. pH especially may affect hybrid
structure via polymerization of silicate ion, because an acid and a base are
hydrolysis and polymerization catalysts, respectively. Moreover, when
magnetically anisotropic molecules are added to the system, the magnetic
field may lead to the hexagonal structure. For example, 5% anthracene
induced the amorphous-hexagonal transition by a 10-T magnetic field.
Thus, steady magnetic fields can control indirectly the pore size, pore
volume and pore direction of mesoporous inorganic polymers via organic
mesophases as the template.

4.2.2 Magnetic Regulation of Lipid Membranes
There are many reports on magnetic field effects on biological systems:
structural changes in organisms,'^^ catalytic activities,^ '^^ material
transport,^^^ etc. Since biological cells contain many components and
elementary processes, the magnetic responses of such complex biological
systems may often be contradictory to each other. To elucidate the
magnetic effects on biosystems, those on each elementary process should
be examined. For this purpose, an artificial lipid bimolecular membrane

called the black lipid membrane (BLM), and unilamellar and multilamellar
vesicles (liposomes) have been used as models for biomembranes, although
such thermodynamical lipid membranes are too simple.
There are many studies on electromagnetic field effects on model
systems as well as living systems because it is generally believed that an
electromagnetic field should be more effective for biological systems than
a steady magnetic field. On the other hand, studies on steady magnetic
field effects on model membrane systems are relatively limited. In this
section, the great effects of relatively low, steady magnetic fields less than
0.5 T to high magnetic fields of up to 30 T on the membrane potential (*P)
and resistance (R) of BLMs are presented. Moreover, magnetic field-
induced fusion and division of vesicles are demonstrated. Such significant
magnetic responses in membrane functions and structures are not familiar,
although it is well known that diamagnetic lipid assemblies as well as
liquid crystals and macromolecules tend to align under steady magnetic
fields.'-'^
A. Steady Magnetic Field Effects on Black Lipid Membranes
The membrane potential and resistance of BLMs, comprising didodecyl
phosphite (DP), dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and
dioctadecyldimethylammonium chloride (DODAC), changed remarkably
under low, steady magnetic fields of less than 0.5 T.'^ ^^^ The electrical
properties seem to be affected not via the Lorentz force on the ion flux, but
via a cooperative orientation of lipid molecules. Under high magnetic
fields, another magnetic field effect on a bilayer membrane comes from the
elastic properties of the membrane. Helfrich predicted theoretically the
magnetic deformation of liposomes from a sphere to an ellipsoid,'^^ and
Tenforde and Liburdy showed experimentally the magnetic undulation of
membrane deformation.^^ Moreover, Ozeki and coworkers found that the
magnetoundulation of membranes brought about magnetofusion and
magnetodivision of vesicles and great responses in the electrical properties
of BLMs. ^'^'^
The BLM in aqueous solutions was formed at 298 K for DP and
311 K for DPPC and DODAC in the hole (ca. 0.8 mm diameter) of a thin
Teflon sheet (0.5 mm thickness) which divided the Teflon cell into two
compartments.^^^ *F arising across a BLM by maintaining a 10-fold
difference in the NaCl concentration (1 x 10""^ and 1 x 10"' mol dm'^) was
measured with a couple of Ag-AgCl electrodes. The dilute side of the
solution was taken as being negative. /? of a BLM in a 1 x 10"^ mol dm""^
NaCl solution was measured by means of two platinized Pt electrodes.
BLM-forming solutions were prepared by mixing 20 ppm of DP or DPPC
with (3 + 2) octane-dodecane.

maximum response (A/max) at around 0.2 T (// = Hc\) and the reverse
response at // > 0.4 T. *F for DPPC membranes changed by ca. 2 mV even
at 0.025 T. The changing rate (100 A/T/b) in "F and R reached more than -50
and 4% (13 mV and 20 MQ) at 0.2 T and 20 and -2% at 0.45 T. These

--- Page 175 ---

4.2 Magnetic Field Controls of Molecular Assemblies and Gels 157
magnetic responses seem to be notably large from the viewpoint that, for
example, the magnetic field theoretically required to produce a 10%
reduction in the conduction of a nerve impulse was roughly 24 T.'^^
It is assumed that magnetic fields should modify the apparent fixed
charge density (a) of the membrane, e.g., a modification of the distribution
of small ions around the head groups and/or in the membrane and inherent
charge-bearing ability of head groups. In order to discuss qualitatively
from the viewpoint of cr, a theory^^^ for a thick membrane was applied to
our systems because, to our knowledge, no theory exists for a BLM. The
features in the experimental magnetic responses of *P and R for DP
membranes seem to be consistent with the theory.'^^ [*P(mV), /?(MQ)] from
the theory is estimated [-20, 520], [-10, 546], and [-24, 503] for a
(10-^ mol dm-^) = 6.4 at // = 0, 4.3 at // = //d, and 7.4 at // = 0.45 T,
respectively. The changing rates in *F and R from the estimated values are
-50 and 5% at He] and 20 and -1.9% at 0.45 T, respectively, which are
consistent with the experimental rates of -50 and 4% at Hd and 20 and
-2% at 0.45 T. Thus, the a values may be used as a measure for an
effective fixed charge density of the BLM. Fig. 4-2-4(A) shows that the
estimated a changed with magnetic field through a minimum (cTmin) at
around 0.2 T.'^^

158 4 Magneto-thermodynamic Effects
When a magnetic field (////) was parallel to the lipid membrane, i.e.,
perpendicular to the direction of ion flow, no magnetic effect was observed
at 0.5 T, suggesting that an ion flow would not be directly affected by the
Lorentz force. Thus, the change in a due to magnetic fields may be
brought about by the molecular orientation, which leads to changes in the
molecular density (area per molecule) at the membrane surface. If H and/or
N in Eq. (1) is large enough, the long molecular axis tends to align in a
direction perpendicular to // (0 = n/2) because of the negative diamagnetic
anisotropy {Ax < 0). Under 1 T and 298 K, significant orientational effects
are expected when A^ is on the order of 10^ for A;^ ~ -1 x 10"^ (for lipids),
at which the magnetic orientational energy is comparable to the thermal
energy if other energies associated with orientadonal changes, such as
surface energy, intermolecular interaction energy and elastic energy for
membrane deformation, are neglected. It seems possible that such a
domain exists in the BLM used comprising 10'^ molecules, as is known in
insoluble monolayers.
When a lipid molecule tilts under a magnetic field, the occupied
molecular area increases monotonically with 0; thus a would also decrease
monotonically with magnetic field. On the other hand, with increasing 0,
the hydrocarbon/water interface at the membrane surface should increase
and destabilize the tilted structure. Thus the critical tilt angle (0ci) must
exist at the first critical magnetic field Hc\. Then one possible way to
increase cr or | *F | at higher magnetic field than He would be to introduce
membrane deformation in a plane surface, e.g., a small displacement of the
head groups in the direction perpendicular to the surface, like a nematic
liquid crystal. From these considerations, a possible model for the
magnetic responses under low magnetic fields is depicted schematically in
Fig. 4-2-4(B). Such deformation would lead to a reduction of the
hydrocarbon/water interfacial energy.
Over 0.15 T, ^ decreased across 0 at 0.3 T with an increase in //, and
reached a plateau (-8 mV) in the range 10 to 12 T, followed by a steep
decrease in the range 12 to 20 T, then approached -18 mV at 28 T. The
steep *F change at around 12 T seems to correspond to vesicle growth,
suggesting that the large change in *F should arise from modification of the
membrane structure. The membrane deformation out of a plane surface,
i.e., undulation, may be expected so as to relax the orientational defects
among domains having different orientation at a tilt angle under higher
magnetic fields larger than a few T. This should lead to a ripple-like
structure. In fact, DPPC liposomes, which were cooled down from 318 to
303 K under a high magnetic field (11.7 T), showed a proton nuclear
magnetic resonance (500 MHz) pattern very similar to its ripple phase.^^^
At least, the undulation structure must be frozen or stable under a 11.7-T
magnetic field in the cooling process. Such irreversible deformation has
been observed by means of phosphorus (^'P) and deuterium (^H) NMR.^^

4.2 Magnetic Field Controls of Molecular Assemblies and Gels 159
B. Magnetofusion and Magnetodivision of Vesicles
A high steady magnetic field should induce membrane deformation. Then,
one interesting question is whether or not deformation in the diamagnetic
molecular assemblies due to high magnetic fields can induce fusion among
vesicles and division of a vesicle.
The bilayer membrane is not a homogeneously curved surface if it
has different elastic properties because of, for example, orientational
defects. The Helfrich theory for the magnetodeformation, silr^, of a
spherical bilayer vesicle of radius ro, in which the domains in the bilayer
have a local curvature co, gives the equation
S2/ ro = rQ^AxbH^^ 13k, (6 - Coro) (2)
where Z? is a measure of the thickness of the bilayer and kc is the curvature-
elastic modulus. ^"^^ Then, the total energy (£"(ro)) of a vesicle which
initially has radius ro comprises the curvature-elastic (Ec) and magnetic
energies (£H),
Liposome growth from radius ro to r with the association of n vesicles
under a magnedc field may be possible when the following relation is
satisfied^^^:
£"(ro)>(l/Ai)£"(r) (4)
When association occurs without changes in the vesicle surface area, r is
simply given by
r = n^^'ro (5)
When H is large enough (-10 T) (case 1) or the shape of a liposome is
exactly an ellipsoid of revolution (case 2), the following relation is
obtained if co is unchanged during the size change'^\*
6(\-n)-Coro(n'^''-n)>0 (6)
This relation was derived from Eqs. (2), (3) and (4) using the two
equations (Ec and En) in ref. 14 for case 1 or the following two equations
for case 2:
^c=(8;r/5)/:c(6-Coro)(52/ro)' (7)
£H =-(16;r/15)A;t:^//Vo52 (8)
Solving Eq.(6) and adding the condition Ax (6 - coro) > 0, possible
association in vesicle having radius ro may be estimated for a given radius
of curvature p(= 1/co), as shown in Fig. 4-2-5.^^^ The shadowing in the
figure illustrates the regions of magnetofusion (n> I) and magnetodivision
{n< 1) for p = 25 nm. When « = 1, a vesicle of size ro is stable against or

insensitive to a certain magnetic field, that is, the apparent Ax of a whole
vesicle should be zero.
a. Steady magnetic field effects on vesicles
Vesicles were prepared from chloroform solutions of DPPC by the
Bangham method. The average vesicle size was determined as a sphere
from the Einstein-Stokes equation by dynamic light scattering at 298 K
under no magnetic field. Vesicles grew when they were exposed to high
magnetic fields of more than 12 T at 318 K for 3 h, e.g., from 160 nm to
275 nm in radius by applying a magnetic field of 20 T; this may be referred
to as magnetofusion. ^^^ Small vesicles of less than 500 nm were grown by a
10-T magnetic field. However, the larger vesicles were reduced in size by
magnetic fields, i.e., magnetodivision of vesicles was induced. Fig. 4-2-5
summarizes the experimental ratio of r to ro or square root n as a function
of ro. A comparison of the theoretical to the experimental vesicle size under
magnetic fields shows that almost all experimental points drop in the
theoretical region for po = 20 nm.
Figure 4-2-6(A) shows changes in the size distribution for DODAC
vesicles containing 20 mol% anthracene or pyrene with the application of a
10-T magnetic field and 30 T at 318 K for 1 h. Different size distributions
were obtained depending on the kind of additive employed: magnetofusion
for the anthracene system and magnetodivision for the pyrene system.

unclear. The vesicle size distribution strongly depended on the exposure
time for a steady magnetic field within 1 h. Even when the time of
exposure to a steady magnetic field was very short marked changes were
observed: 5-s exposure to a 10-T magnetic field induced a bimodal
distribution for vesicle size. Furthermore, just a 10-ms pulse of a 20-T
magnetic field promoted significant magnetodivision of vesicles, changing
from a monomodal size distribution to a typical bimodal one (Fig. 4-2-
6(B)).

4.2.3 Structure and Functions of Chemically Cross-linked Hydrogels
Prepared under Steady Magnetic Fields
Hydrogels have been investigated not only from the viewpoint of purely
scientific interest but also technological aspects such as drug delivery and
actuator. Thus, it is very important to investigate the methodology for
control of structures and physical properties of gels. Although the magnetic
energy of a nonmagnetic molecule in magnetic fields is much less than the
thermal energy, macromolecules having high molecular weight and
magnetic anisotropy can be oriented by high magnetic fields. Therefore,
magnetic fields may provide a useful method for the structural control of
gels. Magnetic anisotropy of a monomer or a polymer chain is not enough
to respond to magnetic fields, but polymer chains produced in the
polymerization process may orient cooperatively. When the oriented
polymer chains are cross-linked, a structured gel may be obtained. Gel
properties depend on polymer chain distribution, cross-link density and
hydration. If we can control these factors by magnetic fields, a novel gel
would be generated.
NIPA and AAm gels were prepared from aqueous solutions of
700 mM A^-isopropylacrylamide (NIPA) or acrylamide (AAm) monomer
and A^,7V'-methylenebisacrylamide (BIS) of various concentrations (CBIS =
4.3, 8.6, 17.2, 25.8, and 34.4 mM) in a thin glass capillary (inner diameter:
0.4 mm) at 278 K. The radical polymerization was initiated by potassium
peroxodisulfate and accelerated by A^,N,A^^A^'-tetramethylethylenediamine.
Steady magnetic fields (< 30 T) were applied perpendicular (Hi) or parallel
(H//) to the capillary for 60 min (during polymerization) using a
superconducting magnet and a hybrid magnet. Then the capillary remained
at rest under zero field at 278 K for 24 h. Cylindrical gels prepared were
taken out of the capillaries, washed repeatedly by temperature swings in a
large amount of fresh distilled water, then dried in air at room temperature.
The volume of NIPA gels prepared under steady magnetic fields
increased (Fig. 4-2-7(A)), and their volume phase transitions were much
more significant, as shown in Fig. 4-2-7(B). Magnetic fields increased the
diameter of the gels in the swelling state, but decreased the diameter in the
shrinking state.'^^ The diameter of gels in the swelling state increased
linearly with increase in magnetic field below 10 T, and became about 40%
larger at 30 T and 298 K than that of a zero-field gel.'^^ The volume phase
transition temperature did not change by magnetic field. When NIPA gels
were prepared at high /'^ (= CBIS/CNIPA, where CNIPA = 700 mM), the
diameter in the swelling state decreased continuously, i.e., no volume
phase transition appeared. However, when they were prepared under
magnetic fields, the diameter changed discontinuously at 33.8°C; the
volume phase transition appeared. The discontinuity in the volume phase
transition of the NIPA gels became more significant with increasing

magnetic field intensity. The plots of the diameters of swelling and
shrunken gels at the volume phase transition temperature vs. magnetic
field intensity give the swelling line and the shrunken line, between which
the volume phase transition occurs. The swelling lines indicate that the
diameter was not saturated even at 30 T. The swelling and shrunken lines
of the gels were prepared at various q^'^ close at each magnetic field
intensity, /fv, where no volume phase transition occurs. In other words,
magnetic fields higher than //v induced the volume phase transition of
NIPA gels. The same phenomenon was observed in AAm gels, which are
well known as a nonvolume phase transition gel. Since the diameter of gels
increased with decreasing BIS concentration in preparation, it is inferred
that the decrease in gel diameter due to magnetic fields should be ascribed
to the reduction of cross-linkage in gels prepared under magnetic fields.
The effective degree of cross-linkage (q^^) was estimated by comparing the
diameter of gels prepared at different degrees of cross-linkage and zero-

164 4 Magneto-thermodynamic Effects
field with that of gels prepared under magnetic fields. Magnetic fields
reduced the effective cross-linkage, e.g., from /'^ = 0.0123 to q^^ = 0.004
at 10 T; generally q^^ < 1/3 /'^ over 15 T. Considering no change in C/N
ratios of gels estimated by elemental analysis with magnetic field, dangling
chains would be increased by magnetic fields. Also, the average number of
residues between cross-linking points increased with increasing magnetic
field intensity, which was estimated by the equation given by Flory. The
above findings suggest that magnetic fields reduced the network density of
gels to soften the gels.
Volume phase transition is subject to diffusion of the polymer
network in medium.^^^ The diffusion depends on polymer concentration
and cross-link density. Therefore, the decrease in the network density
under magnetic fields seems to induce the volume phase transition of high
q^'^ gels. However, considering that no volume phase transition was
observed even when AAm gels were prepared at low ^P'^ the volume phase
transition induced must also be subject to factors other than the network
density. The volume changes of Hi gels were much larger than those of H//
gels, suggesting that magneto-orientation of polymer chains in gels made
the gels anisotropic. The structural anisotropy led to a difference in the
iodine diffusion rate in H± and H// gels, which were about 10% faster and
20% slower than that of a zero-field gel, respectively.
4.2.4 Conclusion
Steady magnetic fields of less than 0.1 T brought about significant
responses in membrane potential and resistance. Deformation in lipid
membranes led to the magnetofusion and magnetodivision of the vesicles
and large changes in the electrical properties of their black membranes
under steady magnetic fields of up to 30 T. Pulsed magnetic fields also
affected lipid membranes very effectively. Micelles were deformed by
steady magnetic fields. Also, surfactant/silicate molecular assemblies were
effectively regulated by steady magnetic fields via orientation of surfactant
molecules used as template, leading to specific pore structures and
adsorptivity of mesoporous silicas. In these systems, magnetically
anisotropic molecules can effectively control the magnetoresponses in
structures and functions of molecular assembly systems. Chemically cross-
linked gels were also modified by magnetic fields in preparation and
regulated by applying external magnetic fields. These examples
demonstrate the potentiality of various magnetic fields that can regulate
the function, structure and size of artificially organized molecular
assemblies. This will lead to extensive applications for sensors, electric
devices, material transport, structure-controlled materials preparation, drug
release and numerous other uses.

4.3 Magnetic Field-induced Martensitic Transformation in
Ferrous Alloys
4.3.1 Effect of Magnetic Field on Martensitic Transformation
Temperature
Martensitic transformation, which occurs in many Fe-, Cu- and Ti-based
alloys and ceramics, is a typical first-order structural phase transition
without atom diffusion and has been widely studied to determine its
characteristics from physical, metallographical and crystallographic
viewpoints/^ In addition, the martensitic transformation has also been
studied from a technological viewpoint, partly because fine martensite

--- Page 184 ---

166 4 Magneto-thermodynamic Effects
Structures formed in quenched ferrous alloys and steels are effective for
strengthening and are thus used as structural materials, and partly because
the shape memory effect and pseudoelasticity effect appear in relation to
the thermoelastic martensitic transformation, and these effects are useful
for practical purposes as functional materials.
According to studies by Patel and Cohen^^ and Otsuka et al.,^^ some
aspects of martensitic transformation such as transformation temperature,
crystallography and the amount and morphology of the product martensites
are strongly influenced by external fields, such as temperature, hydrostatic
pressure and uniaxial stress. To clarify the effects of these external fields
on martensitic transformation it is very important to understand the
essential matters of the transformation such as thermodynamics, kinetics
and the origin of the transformation. Magnetic field is one of such external
fields because some difference in magnetic moment between the parent
and martensite states exists.^^
How the transformation temperature is influenced by the magnetic
field is shown schematically. Fig. 4-3-1 shows the temperature dependence
of the Gibbs chemical free energy of the parent phase (G^) and the
martensite phase (G""). At high temperature, the Gibbs chemical free
energy of the parent phase is lower than that of the martensite phase so the
parent is stable. When the parent phase is cooled, martensitic
transformation does not occur at equilibrium temperature, To, but occurs at
Ms, which is below To. This is because the interfacial energy and strain
energy are needed to initiate the transformation, and this additional energy
is supplied by the excess cooling from To to M^. When the magnetic field is
applied to the system, the Gibbs chemical free energy of the martensite

chemical free energy of the parent is neglected here for simplicity).
Therefore, the equilibrium temperature under the magnetic field increases
as shown in the figure. Also, the Ms, under the magnetic field increases to
Ms' if it is assumed that the martensitic transformation under the magnetic
field occurs at the temperature where the change in Gibbs chemical free
energies under the magnetic field, (G""- G^), is the same as that under no
magnetic field at Ms. This assumption on the effect of the magnetic field is
analogous to that on the effect of uniaxial stress and hydrostatic pressure
made by Patel and Cohen.^^ The validity of the assumption has been
confirmed by many researchers, that is, the effect of uniaxial stress on Ms
calculated by the assumption is in good agreement with the experimental
one in many materials.
In the following, the results of more detailed studies concerning the
effect of the magnetic field on the transformation temperatures in many
ferrous alloys are discussed. The samples used are three Invar Fe-Ni
alloys, disordered and ordered Fe-Pt Invar alloys and non-Invar Fe-Ni-C
and Fe-Mn-C alloys.^'^^ Their structural changes are basically those from
fee to bcc. High-field magnetization measurements were performed at the
Research Center for Materials Science at Extreme Conditions, Osaka
University, the magnetic field used in the study being a pulsed one with
maximum strength of 31 MA m"^ Details of the ultrahigh magnetic field
instrument are reported elsewhere.^^ Fig. 4-3-2 shows typical
magnetization curves (M(t)~H(t)) for Invar Fe-31.7Ni and non-Invar Fe-
24.7Ni-1.8C and Fe-3.9Mn-5.0C (at%) alloys, where Ar represents the
temperature difference between a set temperature T and Ms (AT = T - Ms).
In the figure, an abrupt increase in magnetization is recognized for all the
alloys at a certain strength of the magnetic field as indicated by an arrow.
The magnetic field, H^ at the abrupt increase in magnetizafion is the
critical one for inducing the martensitic transformation at r. That is, the set
temperature is interpreted as the martensitic transformation start
temperature, Ms', under the strength of magnetic field of He. The relations
thus obtained between the critical magnetic field and the shift of Ms, AMs (=
Ms'-Ms), are shown in Fig. 4-3-3 with solid circles for several alloys. It is
known from the figure that AMs increases with increasing magnetic field
for all the alloys examined, and the rate of the increase against the
magnetic field depends on the alloy system.
We have proposed^^ the following equation to estimate the relation
between the critical magnetic field and the transformation temperature:
AG(Ms)-AG(Ms') = -AM(Ms')//c--;C///c'+^of^l//c^ (1)
where AG(Ms) and AG(Ms') is the difference in Gibbs chemical free energy
between the parent and martensite phases at Ms and Ms' temperatures,
respectively, AM(Ms') is M"^(MS')-MP(MS') (where M"^ and M^ are the

respectively), X"^ the high magnetic field susceptibility in the parent phase,
Co the volume change associated with martensitic transformation, co the
forced volume magnetostriction and B the parent bulk modulus. The first
term on the right-hand side of Eq. (1) represents the energy due to the
magnetostatic effect, which was already proposed by Krivoglaz and
Sadovsky."^^ The second and third terms are introduced by the author's
group and represent the energies due to the high-field susceptibility and
forced volume magnetostriction effects, respectively.
The second term in Eq. (1) is related to the induced magnetic
moment in the parent phase by applying a magnetic field and is originally
the same as the magnetostatic energy like the first term. Strictly speaking,
the moment induced in the martensite must be considered, but its value is
smaller than that of the parent phase in many Fe-based alloys. So we
neglect the value of induced moment in the martensite.
The third term in Eq. (1) is quite effective for the Invar alloys
because co in Invar alloys are larger by one order than those of non-Invar
alloys. Here, we will simply show how to derive the third term. It is well
known that Invar alloys have a large forced volume magnetostriction as
mentioned before. This means that 3co/3// is quite large in Invar alloys. The
value of 3co/3// is isotropically positive, that is, the austenite is subject to

comes from the Pauli repulsion in the induced magnetization.
Phenomenologically, it can be regarded as a negative hydrostatic pressure
for the austenite. The effect of hydrostatic pressure on transformation start
temperature was quantitatively studied by Patel and Cohen^^ and they
proposed the equation
AG(Ms,0)- AG(Ms' ,0) = -E^P (2)
where AG(Ms, 0) represents the difference in Gibbs chemical free energy
between austenite and martensite phases under no pressure at Ms
(transformation start temperature under no pressure), AG(Ms\ 0) that at Ms'
(transformation start temperature under pressure P), and eo the volume

pressure (i.e., isotropic expansion) is produced by the forced volume

magnetostriction effect, the negative term -e^P in Eq. (2) must be replaced
by the positive term £o(d(x)/dH )HB, since (dco/dH )HB corresponds to the
hydrostatic pressure P.
The calculated relation between AA/s and magnetic field based on Eq.
(1) are shown in Fig. 4-3-3 by dotted lines, which are in good agreement
with the experimental ones for all the alloys. We also show the calculated
magnetic field dependence of transformation temperature for each term in
Eq. (1) in order to learn which term is effective in changing the
transformation temperature by magnetic field. Typical calculated results
for Invar Fe-31.7 at% Ni alloy and Fe-24.0 at% Pt alloy with S = 0.8 are
shown in Fig. 4-3-4, where the dotted lines denoted by M.S.E., H.F.E.,
F.M.E. and (M.S.E. -\- H.F.E. -h F.M.E.) are the //c vs. Ms' relations
calculated for the magnetostatic, high field susceptibility, forced volume
magnetostriction and their total effects, respectively. As seen from the
figure, the calculated relations (M.S.E. + H.F.E. + F.M.E.) are in good
agreement with the experimental ones for both alloys. It should be noted
that the shift of Ms due to the forced magnetostriction effect is nearly of the
same order as that due to the magnetostatic effect for both alloys, and the
shift of Ms due to this effect is a decrease in the ordered Fe-Pt alloy, but an
increase in the Fe-Ni alloy. This difference is due to the fact that the
volume change associated with the martensitic transformation in the
ordered Fe-Pt alloy is negative, but positive in the Fe-Ni alloy.
Incidentally, in Eq. (1) we neglect the energies due to the well-known
effects of magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the shape anisotropy since the

energies due to these effects are smaller than those due to the effect shown
in Eq. (1) under high magnetic fields. Recently, however, the
magnetocrystalline anisotropy was found to play an important role in
magnetic field-induced martensitic transformation in a Co-Fe alloy'^^ and a
Ni-Mn-Ga alloy.''^ Furthermore, this anisotropy is important for the
rearrangement of martensite variants, which will be described later.
4.3.2 Magnetoelastic Martensitic Transformation
In alloys exhibiting a thermoelastic martensitic transformation, each
martensite crystal grows or shrinks with temperature cycling, that is, it
responds elastically to temperature to maintain the balance between
thermal and elastic energies. If a uniaxial stress is applied to such an alloy
at a temperature above Af (reverse transformation finish temperature) and
released, the forward and reverse transformations occur by a loading cycle.
Thus the martensite is induced only while the stress is loaded and reverts
to the parent phase when the stress is released. Considering this behavior,
it is expected that if a magnetic field is applied above Af to an alloy which
exhibits a thermoelastic martensitic transformation and removed,
martensite can be induced only while the magnetic field is applied and
reverts to the parent phase when the magnetic field is removed. We found
this type of martensitic transformation in an ausaged Fe-31.9Ni-9.8Co-
4.1Ti (at%) shape memory alloy and gave it the term magnetoelastic
martensitic transformation'^^ in analogy to the thermoelastic
transformation. The term "ausage" means that the alloy is aged at a
temperature where its austenitic phase is stable.
Figure 4-3-5 shows the spontaneous magnetization of the parent and
the martensite phases as a function of temperature obtained by
magnetization measurements under low magnetic field. The difference in
spontaneous magnetization between the two phases is about 0.3 //e/atom at
Ms, which is of the same order as that in a previous Fe-32.5 at%Ni alloy. Ms
and Af shown with arrows are determined to be about 127 and 159 K,
respectively and As is 60 K. A pulsed high magnetic field was applied to a
sample at a temperature above Af, 163 K (AT= (T-M,) = 36 K) and typical
M(t)-H(t) curves obtained are shown in Fig. 4-3-6(a) and (b). It is noted in
Fig. 4-3-6(a) that there is no hysteresis in magnetization when a pulsed
magnetic field of 22.22 MA m"' is applied and removed. This means that
22.22 MA m"' is lower than the critical field He for inducing the
martensitic transformation, and therefore no martensitic transformation
occurs under a magnetic field of 22.22 MA m ^ A higher magnetic field
was then applied, and the M(t)-H(t) curve obtained is shown in (b),
revealing a hysteresis of magnetization. That is, when a magnetic field is
applied, the rate of increase of magnetization against the magnetic field
changes at He = 23.08 MA m"\ as indicated by an arrow, and when the
magnetic field is removed, the increased magnetization returns to the

Martensites

formed by cooling to slightly below the Ms temperature in Fe-Ni-C alloys
((a), (d) and (g)) and those of magnetic field-induced martensites ((b), (c),
(e), (f), (h) and (i)). The formation temperature r, ^T (= T-M,) and H are
shown below each photograph. Despite the different formation
temperatures, the Fe-28.7Ni-1.8C mass% alloy exhibits thin plate
morphology and the two other alloys show lenticular morphology. It is
noted that the martensite morphology is different even if the martensites
are formed at nearly the same temperature, as seen from a comparison of
(c) and (d). This result is contradictory to the proposition that the
martensite morphology in Fe-Ni-C alloys is decided only by the formation
temperature.^"^^ The reason for this difference is not yet known. The same
results (the morphology of a magnetic field-induced martensite was the
same as that of a thermally-induced one irrespective of the formation
temperature and the strength of magnetic field) are obtained for Fe-Ni^ and
Fe-Mn-C^ alloys.

inscribed below each photograph. It is known from (b) and (c) that several
martensite plates grow neariy parallel to the direction of magnetic field and
run from one end to the other end of single crystals. Such directional
growth of martensite plates does not appear in thermally induced
martensite, as shown in (a). Therefore, directional growth appears to be a
characteristic of magnetic field-induced martensites. Fig. 4-3-7(e) is an
enlargement of the framed-area of (c), from which it is seen that one plate
grows lengthwise along the direction of the magnetic field and that other
plates terminate at the directionally grown plates. This means that the
directionally grown plates were formed first and followed by the other
plates. The reason for this lengthwise growth of martensite plates under
magnetic field is not clear, but shape magnetic anisotropy effect appears to
play an important role.
4.3.4 Giant Magnetic Field-induced Strain in Ferromagnetic Shape
Memory Alloys
Sections 4.3.1 to 4.3.3 above discuss the magnetic field-induced
martensitic transformation. In this and following sections, another effect of
magnetic field on martensite phase is described. In some ferromagnetic
shape memory alloys (FMSMAs), the arrangement of martensite variants
can be controlled by a magnetic field. As a result, a giant magnetic field-
induced strain (MFIS) of several percent arises in these alloys.
Before describing MFIS behavior, the shape memory effect related to
MFIS is explained. When the martensite phase of a shape memory alloy is
induced thermally, it is usually composed of several variants
(crystallographic domains). For simplicity, we consider the case in which
the specimen is composed of two variants, as schematically shown in Fig.
4-3-9. When a shape memory alloy is cooled below the transformation
temperature, all variants will be equivalently formed naturally and they are
arranged so as to minimize the total shape change associated with
transformation (Fig. 4-3-9(a) -^ (b)). The interfaces of variants are
twinning planes, which can be moved easily by the application of external
stress T. As a result, rearrangement of variants occurs and a large strain
appears (Fig. 4-3-9(b) -^ (c)). This strain recovers by heating to the parent
phase (Fig. 4-3-9 (c) -^ (a)). This is the conventional shape memory effect
of shape memory alloys.
In ferromagnetic shape memory alloys, magnetic domains in addition
to variants exist, and the magnetic moment m will be aligned along the
easy axis of each variant, as shown in Fig. 4-3-9 (b). The easy axis of one
variant is nearly parallel to the hard axis of another variant. When a
magnetic field is applied along the hard axis of one variant which
corresponds to the easy axis of another variant, the magnetic energy of the
former variant becomes higher than that of the latter variant. As a result, a
magnetic shear stress Tmag will act across the twinning plane. The twinning

plane will move if Tmag becomes larger than the shear stress required for the
twinning plane movement Treq, resulting in a large field-induced strain (Fig.
4-3-9(b) -> (c)). The maximum energy difference between the two variants
is the magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant, and it is attained when the
magnetic moment becomes parallel to the hard axis for one variant.
Considering the above mechanism, a large magnetocrystalline
anisotropy constant and small treq are essential to realize a giant MFIS in
ferromagnetic shape memory alloys. Based on this criterion, several
ferromagnetic shape memory alloys have been studied. The first report of a
giant MFIS was made by Ullakko et al.^^^ in a Ni-Mn-Ga alloy. After that, a
giant MFIS was also found in Fe-Pd alloys'^' '^^ and in FesPt.'^^ In the
following, we describe the MFIS in Fe-31.2Pd (at%), Fe3Pt and Ni2MnGa,
and in the subsequent section, we show that the relation rmag>rreq is clearly
realized in Fe-31.2Pd.
All three alloys (Fe-31.2Pd, Fe3Pt, Ni2MnGa) exhibit thermoelastic
martensitic transformations. The Fe-31.2Pd alloy transforms from the Al-
type structure (a quenched phase) to a tetragonal structure (so-called f.c.t.);
the FeaPt with degree of order of about 0.8 transforms from the Lh-type
structure to the L6o-type structure; and NiiMnGa transforms from the L2i-
type structure to the 10 M martensite with a pseudotetragonal structure.
The martensitic transformation temperature is 230 K for Fe-31.2Pd, 85 K
for FesPt and 202 K for Ni2MnGa. Fig. 4-3-10 shows the lattice parameters
of these alloys as a function of temperature. The lattice parameters of the
martensite phase in Fe-31.2Pd and Fe^Pt change gradually as temperature

--- Page 195 ---

4.3 Magnetic Field-induced Martensitic Transformation in Ferrous Alloys 177
decreases, but the change in NiiMnGa is small. Common to the three
alloys, the tetragonality {da) at 77 K (for FesPt at 4.2 K) is about 0.94. The
easy axis of the Fe-31.2Pd is the a axis and that of the FeaPt and the
NiiMnGa is the c axis. Considering that the martensite phase is tetragonal,
there are three corresponding variants in the martensite phase. The
interface of these variants is {101}M (M stands for the martensite phase)
type twinning plane. The [001]? direction (P stands for the parent phase)
corresponds to the c axis for one variant and to the a axis for the remaining
two variants. The Curie temperature is about 650 K for Fe-31.2Pd, about
450 K for FeaPt and 376 K for NisMnGa. Fe-31.2Pd and FesPt are also
known as Invar alloys.
Figure 4-3-11 shows the MFIS obtained in single crystals of the three
alloys. The strain was measured along the [001]? direction by a capacitance
method under a magnetic field applied along the [001]? direction after the

178 4 Magneto-thermodynamic Effects
Specimen was cooled to 77 K (4.2 K for Fe3Pt) under zero magnetic field.
For all specimens, the strain starts to appear at a field of about 0.25 MA
m"' and then saturates. The saturated strain is larger than 2% for all alloys.
The specimen expands along the magnetic field in Fe-31.2Pd but contracts
in FcsPt and Ni2MnGa. This difference is due to the difference in the easy
axis. By using the strain and lattice parameters, we can evaluate the
fraction of the variant whose easy axis lies along the field direction. This
fraction is about 100% for Fe-31.2Pd and Ni2MnGa, but it reaches only
70% for FeaPt. One more characteristic feature of the FesPt alloy is the
appearance of reversible MFIS. That is, as seen in curve B of Fig. 4-3-
11(b), part of the field-induced strain (about 0.6%) recovers in the field
removing process, and a strain of about 0.6% repeatedly appears in the
subsequent field applying and removing processes (curves C-F in Fig. 4-3-
11(b)). This reversible strain is larger than the magnetostriction of
TERFENOL-D, which is known as a super magnetostrictive material. The
strain recovery in Fe^Pt will be caused by the accumulation of elastic
energy, but the reason is not yet known. The reversible strain exhibits
significant temperature dependence and reaches about 1 % at 20 K.
4.3.5 Energy Evaluation for Twinning Plane Movement by Magnetic
Field
Since the twinning plane moves under a magnetic field as mentioned
above, a kind of shear stress, imag, should act across the twinning plane
under a magnetic field. In the following we evaluate Tmag and compare it
with the stress required for the twinning plane movement Treq for the case
oftheFe-31.2Pd alloy.
In evaluating Tmag, we must know the magnetic energy difference per
unit volume AUmag between the two states before and after the movement
of the twinning plane. The magnetic shear stress will be expressed as Tmag
= AUmag/s, where s is the amount of twinning shear. Assuming that the
magnetic energy is mainly composed of magnetocrystalline anisotropy
energy and Zeeman energy, the maximum of AUmag is the uniaxial
magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant | Ku I when a magnetic field is
applied along the [001]? direction. The value of [KJ is obtained from the
area surrounded by the two magnetization curves along the hard axis and
along the easy axis. In the case of the Fe-31.2Pd alloy at 77 K, the value of
\KU\ is obtained to be 180 kJ m"\ The amount of twinning shear is
expressed as ^ = {1 - (c/af }l{cla). By substituting the lattice parameters
shown in Fig. 4-3-10, s is obtained to be 0.124 for Fe-31.2Pd at 77 K.
Using the above values of | ATu I and s, the maximum of Tmag is calculated to
be about 1.5 MPa for Fe-31.2Pd at 77 K. On the other hand, the value of
Treq Is obtalucd from tensile tests using a single-crystalline specimen and
found to be between 0.6 and 1.2 MPa at 80 K.
Comparing Tmag and Treq mentioned above, it is obvious that the value

--- Page 197 ---

4.4 Control of the Solidification Process by High Static Magnetic Field 179
of Tmag is larger than ireq. In this way, the reason for twinning plane
movement by magnetic field is explained by energy evaluation. The
condition Tmag > treq Is also confirmed to be satisfied for stoichiometric
NizMnGa (at about 80 K, r^ag: 3.4 MPa, Treq: 1.2-2.2 MPa, kul: 420 kJ
m-^5 = 0.124).

4.4 Control of the Solidification Process by High Static Magnetic
Field: Application to YBaCuO Superconductors
Since the synthesis of the superconducting YBaCuO phase in 1987 by Wu
et al.,^^ many efforts have been made on processing it to obtain a material
suitable for high current applications. The superconducting properties of
the orthorhombic YBa2Cu307 are highly anisotropic, and in particular,
critical currents are much larger in the ab plane of the lamellar structure
(Cu02 planes) than along the perpendicular c axis. Grain boundaries are
weak electrical junctions, and local measurements confirm that
superconducting magnetization currents loops only flow inside individual
grains. For high current applications, such as large monodomains for
superconducting magnetic bearings or long conductors for current
limitation devices, it is necessary to process large grained samples with
controlled crystallographic orientation.

4.4.1 YBaCuO Growth
The YBa2Cu30^ (123) phase incongruently melts at 1015°C in air to form
the mixture of a Ba- and Cu- rich Hquid and of the YzBaCuOs (211) solid
phase (so-called "green phase"). During cooling, the 123 phase is formed
by a peritectic reaction between the hquid and the 211 phase. In a typical
peritectic recombination, the 123 phase should nucleate at each 211/liquid
interface on cooling, thus leading to a small-sized multigrain material,
since many green phase 211 particles are dispersed in the liquid above
1015°C. However, using high temperature optical microscopy, Rodriguez
et al.^^ demonstrated the nucleation of the 123 phase directly in the liquid.
Cima et al.^^ and Izumi et al.^' proposed a model where yttrium is dissolved
from 211 phases and diffuses to the 123/liquid interface to feed the 123
growth. Following Nakamura et al.,^' the growth speed is then governed by
yttrium diffusion in the melt and also by growth kinetics at the interface.
The growth is a slow process and typical values of the growth speed have
been experimentally measured below 1 mm h"^ The resulting material is
an YBa2Cu307 matrix (superconducting phase) including finely dispersed
insulating Y2BaCu05 particles.
4.4.2 Magnetic Texturation Feasibility
A. Mechanisms
High static magnetic fields induce magnetic alignment of solidifying
crystals. Two mechanisms, magnetocrystalline anisotropy and shape
anisotropy, account for this effect where in each case, a magnetic torque
acts on 123 nuclei freely suspended in the melt. If a solidifying single
crystal possesses a magneto-crystalline anisotropy, then its magnetization
M is generally not parallel to the applied field B. The sample is then
submitted to a torque r = VM AB^ with V the crystal volume, and rotates in
order to align its major (algebraic value) susceptibility axis parallel to the
field. In the case of a shape anisotropy, the demagnetizing field and hence
the magnetization depends on the angle between the field and the particle
orientation. The sample tends to rotate in order to maximize its
magnetization (so that it minimizes its internal demagnetization field) and
hence aligns its longest direction parallel to the field, whatever the sign of
the susceptibility may be.
In both mechanisms, the critical parameter for the occurrence of
magnetic alignment is the difference in magnetic energy between the
aligned and misaligned crystal as compared to the thermal disordering
energy kT (where k is the Boltzmann constant and T the temperature). For a
single crystal with magnetic anisotropy Ax, the necessary relation is:
R~
AEanisotropy = ^X ' V > ^T ( 1)
2^0

--- Page 199 ---

4.4 Control of the Solidification Process by High Static Magnetic Field 181
For an elongated shape with a demagnetizing factor n (0 < n < 0.3), this
relation becomes:
4 2^0
A second limiting factor is the orientation time within the solidification
time. The orientation kinetic has been mathematically derived and
experimentally observed for a suspension of fibers in a viscous fluid.^' ^^ It
is found that the tangent of the angle between the applied field and an
orientation axis of the particle follows a decreasing exponential law with a
time constant T: tan(^) = ian{eo)e~''^. The time constant T is given for both
magneto-crystalline and shape anisotropy mechanisms as 7 = A/(2A£'),
where A is a viscous coefficient defined as the ratio between the viscous
torque and the rotation speed. As both A and AE are proportional to the
volume of the particle, T is independent of its size. A rough estimation can
be given for a sphere (A = 8 j^rir\ with r the radius and n the fluid
viscosity), then T = ^"^ must be much lower than the solidification time.
AXB'
B. Magnetic Alignment of YBaCuO
As the anisotropy of Cu02 planes of the lamellar structure could lead to a
magnetic orientation at high temperature, the melting of precursors and the
growth and magnetic orientation of bulk YBaCuO material was then tested
in a high field and high temperature facility. A mixture of Y2BaCu05,
BaCu02 and CuO was heated to 1050°C, maintained for two hours in a 5-T
magnetic field, then cooled at 20°C h"^ to recombine the YBa2Cu307 phase
through the peritetic reaction.
After processing. X-ray diffraction pole figures were measured on
surfaces cut parallel and perpendicular to the applied field Ha. On the
surface perpendicular to Ha, (007) peaks are located in a very small area
parallel to Ha, while they are very weak in the other direction. These
results indicate that the resulting microstructure of the magnetically
processed YBaCuO sample consists of highly orientated crystals with the c
axis parallel to the applied field.^^ This structure is also evidenced by SEM
micrographs showing a layered structure where 10 micron-thick platelets
following the ab planes are stacked together.
During the recombination, nuclei of the YBaCuO phase have been
magnetically aligned in the surrounding liquid. Orientation by a shape
mechanism is rejected since the resulting microstructure should have led to
platelets aligned parallel to the applied field. The actual mechanism is then
the existence of a remaining magnetic anisotropy at the peritectic
temperature, with a larger value along the c axis.
C. Nuclei Size and Orientation Time
The magnetic anisotropy of the YBaCuO phase is associated with the

--- Page 200 ---

182 4 Magneto-thermodynamic Effects
CUO2 planes of the structure. The room temperature value A;f(300 K) is
about lO"'* emu mole"\ and is expected to decrease slowly with the
temperature because of the strong correlations in the Cu-0 layers.^^ The
critical volume for the magnetic orientation of a crystallite (A£ = kT at the
solidification temperature) is much smaller than 1 jim^: at 1500 K,
assuming a temperature independent anisotropy and with a 5-T magnetic
field, the value of the ratio ^E /kT is then about 5000.^^ The time constant T
is about 1 s in 5 T, even for a viscosity 10,000 times larger than that of
water. Considering the slow speed of the solidification process, the
orientation time should not be considered as a limiting factor.
D. Improvement of Magnetic and Superconducting Properties of Bulk
YBaCuO
First, magnetization cycles from zero field cooled state were measured
from 0to6Tat4Kona2x2x2 mm^ cube cut from the center of the
magnetically aligned sample and from a sample processed without field.
The sample processed without magnetic field shows no differences
between vertical and horizontal sample orientation in the measuring field,
in agreement with a disordered polycrystalline structure. The measured
remnant magnetization is then about 0.5 T. In contrast, a large anisotropy is
observed for the field processed sample, with a larger cycle when the
measuring field is parallel to the field applied at high temperature,
confirming the c axis orientation. Moreover, even the magnetization cycle
width measured in the perpendicular direction for this sample is larger than
the one of the zero field processed sample: the remnant magnetization
reaches 1.6 T along the direction of the alignment field and is still about
1 T in the perpendicular direction.
These figures demonstrate that the magnetic alignment enhances the
superconducting critical current density (which is proportional to the
magnetization cycle width) by taking advantage of the alignment of the c
axis and hence of the ab plane, which can carry larger currents. This
alignment also provides a better connection between grains, since both
anisotropic values are larger than in the disordered sample processed
without field.
However, these grain boundaries are still weak, limiting junctions for
large-scale superconducting current, and the number of grains needs to be
reduced, possibly to a single one, to obtain very large magnetizations or
long length conductors. In order to improve growth and reduce the
nucleation rate, the process has been optimized with the help of in situ
magnetic measurement at high temperatures.
4.4.3 In situ Magnetic Susceptibility in High Fields
A. Experimental Setup
When a sample of susceptibility x is placed in a magnetic field B gradient

--- Page 201 ---

4.4 Control of the Solidification Process by High Static Magnetic Field 183
region, it is then submitted to a force:
2jUo
Hence, by measuring the magnetic force exerted on an YBaCuO sample
during its processing, it is then possible to measure in real time its
magnetic susceptibility at high temperature and quantitatively determine
the phase transitions encountered.
A specially designed tubular furnace has been inserted in the vertical
room temperature bore of an Oxford Instrument superconducting magnet.
The high temperature zone of the furnace exists in a working alumina tube
surrounded by either a SiC machined tube heater or a heating wire
embedded in high temperature cement. The heater is insulated from the
exterior by a thin alumina/silica wool insulator, and the overall system is
inserted in a water-cooled jacket to remove heat and protect the magnet
cryostat.
The sample in its crucible is held on top of an alumina thin tube that
is put on the plateau of an electronic balance placed far below the magnetic
field. The sample temperature and magnetic weight are continuously
recorded by computer during the process. The device is conveniently used
for 25 g pellets, but larger samples of up to 200 g can also be processed in
a similar device. Due to the sample weight, the field gradient and the
balance quality, the magnetic susceptibility can be measured with a
sensitivity of about 10"'^ emu g"\ i.e., 10"^ S.I.
B. Standard MTG Process
The standard Melt Texture Growth (MTG) occurs in the slow cooling from
the partial melting state above the peritectic temperature as described
below.
The starting material is a pressed pellet of a mixture of YBa2Cu307,
Y2O3, Ag20 and PtOi powders. Y2O3 is added to provide excess Y2BaCu05
particles, which maintain the sample shape and are known to increase
critical currents. Ag20, which transforms into metal silver, is known to
reduce cracks, and Pt02 also enhances critical currents by reducing the
coarsening of the Y2BaCu05 particles. The sample is rapidly heated to
1100°C to transform all YBa2Cu307 and Y2O3 into a liquid phase
containing Ba and Cu and Y2BaCu05 solid particles. It is rapidly cooled to
1020°C and slow cooling (TC h') is then applied down to 890°C to
promote the peritectic recombination of the 123 phase.
C. Magnetic Signature of Melting, Solidification and Oxygen Exchanges
The magnetic susceptibility recorded during this process is shown in Fig.
4-4-1. On heating, a small increase is seen at 900°C and this is due to the
sintering of the system, together with a first transformation of Y2O3 into

Fig. 4-4-1 Magnetic susceptibility recorded during a standard Melt Texture Growth process of an
YBaCuO sample. All phase transformations and evolution can be monitored: sintering (a),
melting (b to c), Curie-Weiss susceptibility decrease and oxygen loss in the liquid state (c to
d), irreversibility due to poor oxygen uptake on fast cooling (d to e), large oxygen uptake
during slow cooling (e to f), main YBaCuO solidification (f to g), remaining phases

YiBaCuOs. Melting is then evidenced by a large increase, the liquid
containing more magnetic Cu^^ ions. This increase takes place in a large
temperature range (from QGO^'C to 1020°C) due to the high heating rate.
The susceptibility then decreases due to the Curie law behavior of the
paramagnetic liquid combined with a change in the copper valence. On
heating, the ionic liquid loses oxygen so that magnetic Cu^^ is transformed
into nonmagnetic Cu^ following
2[Cu^tg„et.c - O^- ] -^ [(Cu;,,,,g,etic ) " O^" ] + ^ O2 (4)
On cooling, the susceptibility increases, but a large hysteresis is observed
since oxygen uptake in the sample has a slow kinetic. From 1020°C, the
increase is enhanced, the slow cooling applied at that time allowing more
oxygen uptake. Solidification takes place in a very narrow temperature
window, as seen from the rapid susceptibility decrease. At lower
temperatures, the remaining BaCu02 and CuO phases solidify and are
responsible for the new susceptibility increase.
D. Anomalous Solidification
In order to reduce the overall time spent in the liquid state (to avoid
reactions with the crucible and parasitic nucleations) but still promote
growth by slow cooling, the heat treatment has been modified as follows:
rapid cooling was maintained down to a few degrees above the previously
determined solidification point and the slow cooling applied only from that

Fig. 4-4-2 Anomalous solidification observed by magnetic susceptibility when no slow cooling is
applied from 1020°C prior to solidification. Compared to the standard MTG process, the
susceptibility increases slowly from (a) to (b) due to poor oxygen uptake. Rapid
solidification is then evidenced by a sharp kink in the susceptibility curve. The rapid
increase from (b) to (c) was correlated by thermogravimetric measurements with a very fast
and anomalous oxygen uptake prior to the solidification.
lower temperature. As seen in Fig. 4-4-2, the magnetic susceptibility
exhibits a sharp anomalous increase prior to the solidification. The same
experiment was conducted without magnetic field to allow a mass
measurement only of the oxygen exchanges, and a rapid uptake of oxygen
was observed at the same temperature as the anomalous susceptibility rise.
Moreover, the susceptibility change calculated from the oxygen mass
uptake and the resulting copper valence change (Aj = 1.1 x 10"^ emu g~*)
was in very good agreement with the actual change (1.3 x 10~^ emu g~^).
In both samples, the microstructure consists of very small spherulitic
grains, indicating rapid nucleation and poor growth. Although the
mechanism remains unclear, we suggest that since the rapidly cooled
sample was far from oxygen equilibrium, oxygen uptake occurred too
rapidly at that time, triggering a very fast and multiple nucleation as the
equilibrium peritectic temperature increased with oxygen content.
E. Double Dwell Process
In order to obtain both equilibrium oxygen and very large growth in a
reduced time, a double step process has been defined: the heating remains
unchanged, rapid cooling is still applied but at a few degrees above the
experimental solidification point, and the sample is maintained at constant
temperature until oxygen equilibrium is reached. Slow cooling of a few
degrees is then applied and a second temperature dwell is maintained until
complete solidification. In this process, the completion of oxygen
equilibrium and then peritectic recombination are evidenced in real time
by the magnetic susceptibility, as seen in Fig. 4-4-3.

Fig. 4-4-3 Magnetic susceptibility during the "double dwell" process. On cooling, the sample
temperature is stabilized at 955°C until the oxygen uptake evidenced by the susceptibility
increase is complete. A further temperature step is maintained at 946°C until the
solidification evidenced by the susceptibility decrease is complete.
In this figure, both the standard MTG process and the double dwell
process are presented for comparison. From 1020°C to about 955°C, the
susceptibility slope remains constant since almost no oxygen uptake is
allowed by the fast cooling, while a larger increase was seen for the slow
cooling of the standard MTG process. At 955°C, the susceptibility rose at a
constant temperature until it become saturated at a constant value,
indicating that oxygen had reached its equilibrium. Compared to the
standard process, the same susceptibility values were attained at that
temperature. The susceptibility increased again at the slow cooling until
the second dwell was applied at 946°C. Then after a few hours,
solidification occurred and the slow cooling was applied again after the
susceptibility decrease had stopped.
The resulting microstructure of the sample indicated a 17-mm
diameter single grain, and magnetic flux trapping confirmed the circulation
of the magnetization currents in a single loop at the scale of the full
sample.
The magnetic field has been used with two advantages in this study:
all phase transformations could be magnetically monitored to optimize the
growth process, and the single orientation was controlled by the magnetic
alignment.
4.4.4 Supercooling Behavior of the Powder
A. Precursor Effect
In the double dwell process, the temperature profile was determined
following the magnetic susceptibility behavior of the material. A large
supercooling was observed in this case, with onset of the solidification

Fig. 4-4-4 Magnetic susceptibility versus temperature for three precursor batches. The melting and
solidification is strongly dependent on the precursor batch used for the starting powders, as
seen from the magnetic susceptibility measured in three samples with the same composition

indicate the different solidification points.
near QSC'C. This supercooling behavior is strongly dependent on the
composition and the kind of process used. Even keeping the same
composition and thermal process, strong changes in this supercooling
behavior can be evidenced when similar starting materials, but from
different providers, are used.
As seen in Fig. 4-4-4, a particular composition using three different
YBaCuO powder batches from two different providers exhibits a different
solidification temperature when the same cooling process is applied after
melting (heating at 240°C \f\ step at 1100°C for 30 m, rapid cooling to
1020°C, then slow cooling at PC h').
Defining a successful solidification process then requires careful
analysis of the magnetic susceptibility for each new precursor batch in
order to adapt the temperature profile to the supercooling behavior.
B. Overheating Effect
The supercooling behavior for a given batch and a given process is also
very sensitive to the maximum temperature reached in the liquid state. A
classical Melt Textured Growth process was applied at two different
maximum temperatures in the liquid state. A 45°C increase in the
overheating temperature induced an IPC reduction of the solidification
temperature.
C. Solidification Nuclei above the Melting Point
The solidification temperature dependence on the starting material and on
the overheating temperature suggests that the liquid phase, prior to the

--- Page 206 ---

188 4 Magneto-thermodynamic Effects
solidification, retains some information about the history of the sample. In
several systems (YBaCuO, BiSrCaCuO and SmCo), it was found that
magnetic orientation was also very sensitive to the maximum temperature
reached in the liquid state: a higher overheating leading to a larger
supercooling and a worse orientation.'^'
It has been suggested'^' that nuclei of the solid phase could survive
above the melting point of the bulk phase and that those nuclei may control
the solidification and orientation. With a low overheating above the
melting point, the nuclei remain in the liquid, are freely oriented by the
magnetic field and trigger the solidification with a small supercooling.
However, if a large overheating is applied, the nuclei are dissolved and
hence a larger supercooling is necessary to nucleate from heterogeneous
phases, such as the crucible walls, that cannot be magnetically aligned.
4.4.5 Conclusion
Bulk YBa2Cu307 superconductors can be textured by solidification through
a peritectic reaction performed at high temperature in high magnetic field
(7 T). The superconducting properties of the material are improved due to
the alignment of the ab planes and to a better connection between grains.
The high temperature magnetization of the sample in the high
magnetic field can be monitored in real time, following all phase
transformations in the bulk sample. An optimized process can then be
defined after determining the solidification temperature, which is strongly
dependent on the process and the starting materials. In an optimized
double dwell process, the oxygen equilibrium in the first temperature dwell
above the solidification point is probed by the magnetic susceptibility. The
solidification itself is then monitored during a second step a few degrees
below. A large oriented grain with improved superconducting properties is
then obtained.
High temperature, high field magnetization measurement is a
powerful tool to study the general phenomenon of solidification. Relations
between overheating, supercooling and magnetic orientation can be
experimentally investigated in order to test for the existence of
soUdification nuclei above the melting point.

Magnetic Orientation
Magnetic orientation arises from the anisotropic magnetic
energy of substances. Because of this anisotropy, a substance
receives torque in a magnetic field, orienting to the direction
where its magnetic energy is minimum. A single molecule or
ion barely undergoes magnetic orientation since its anisotropic
magnetic energy is negligibly small compared with the thermal
energy at room temperature. Aggregates or assemblies having
ordered structures, however, do undergo magnetic orientation
since their anisotropic magnetic energy exceeds the thermal
energy at room temperature. Magnetic orientation is currently a
very useful technique for industrial applications.
In this chapter, magnetic orientation of organic and
inorganic crystals, organic polymers, organic composites,
polymer gels, carbon nanotubes and other materials is described.
5.1 Magnetic Orientation of Organic and Inorganic Crystals
5.1.1 Magnetic Orientation of Crystals
For molecules having lower symmetry than cubic symmetry, the magnetic
susceptibility is anisotropic (dependent on direction), and the magnetic
energy is anisotropic (different by direction). The magnetic energy
anisotropy {^xnH^I2 = 8.3 x 10"'^ J) for one molecule {\ln = 6.0 x
lO^^mol"') with magnetic susceptibility anisotropy (A;^ = 100 x 10"^ cm^
mor^) in a strong magnetic field (// = 100 kOe) is much less than the
thermal energy {kTll = 2.1 x 10''' J, k\ Boltzmann constant) in a room-
temperature solution (r= 300 K).
When crystals are formed with an ordered structure by arrangement
of anisotropic molecules, the magnetic energy anisotropy becomes as large
as the thermal energy, and the crystals are oriented in the magnetically
stable direction by the magnetic torque against the thermal disordering.
This section reviews the magnetic orientation of small crystals. The
important conclusions are: (1) The magnetic orientation results from the
magnetic susceptibility anisotropy; (2) When the crystals possess a larger

size than a certain value (>1 nm), the magnetic orientation occurs against
the thermal disordering; (3) The magnetic orientation follows the
Boltzmann distribution for variation of the magnetic field intensity at a
fixed temperature.
5.1.2 Crystals in Magnetic Fields
The magnetic orientation has been observed for diamagnetic crystals, such
as benzophenone,''^^ rran^-azobenzene,^^ biphenyl/^ naphthalene^^ and
potassium nitrate crystals.^^ An example is presented for benzophenone
crystals growing in solution.^^ A supersaturated solution of benzophenone
was exposed to horizontal magnetic fields. The crystals appeared at the
interface between the solution and atmosphere and developed in the
horizontal plane. This shows that the crystal growth occurred in a two-
dimensional space.
The benzophenone crystals in the 80.0 kOe magnetic field are shown
in Fig. 5-l-l(a). They have a column form with dimensions of -10 x 1 x
1 mm. They lie horizontal and are oriented in such a way that the
crystallographic c axis (growth direction) is perpendicular to the field. The
crystals in the 4.8 kOe magnetic field are shown in Fig. 5-1-1(b). They are
oriented partially with the c axis perpendicular to the field. The crystals in

the field intensity.)
5.1.3 Crystal Structure and Magnetic Anisotropy
The crystallographic data have been reported: The cell dimensions are a =
10.30, b = 12.15, c = 8.00.A, and the space group is P2^2^2^ with Z = 4.^^
(The cell dimensions of the crystals growing in the 80.0 kOe magnetic
field are the same as those of the crystals in zero field; the cell dimensions
are not affected by the magnetic field.)
The magnetic susceptibilities have been reported to be^' ^^
;f, =-88.0x10"^
;t:, =-88.6x10"^

Since the magnetic susceptibilities are nearly equal between the a and b

along the c axis. The susceptibilities parallel (xw) and perpendicular (x±) to
the c axis are given as

The susceptibility in the parallel (xw) direction is smaller than the
susceptibility in the perpendicular (xi) direction (xw < X^)-
5.1.4 Magnetic Energy
Suppose a crystal is composed of mole number n of molecules and
possesses an axis Z of magnetic symmetry. When the crystal is placed in a
magnetic field //, the magnetic energy is expressed by
E(e,H) = -{nH' /2)[x±-^{X^-Xi)cos'^] (D
where 0 is the angle between the axis Z and field H {0<6 <K) and X\\ and
X± are the molar susceptibilities parallel and perpendicular to the axis Z,
respectively. If the susceptibilities hold a relation of X\\ < X^^ the magnetic
energy £(6, H) has a minimum, and the crystal is stable in the direction
where the axis Z is perpendicular to the magnetic field H{6 = KI2).
For the benzophenone crystals, the crystallographic c axis
corresponds to the axis Z of magnetic symmetry and the magnetic
susceptibilities bear the relation of X\\ < X^- The magnetic energy is
minimized, and the crystals are stabilized in the direction where the c axis
is perpendicular to the magneUc field. Thus, the magnetic orientation is
explained qualitatively by the magnetic energy.
5.1.5 Distribution of Directions of Crystals in Magnetic Fields
The proportion of the oriented crystals in the magnetic fields depends on
the magnetic field intensity. The distribution of the angles that the

At zero field, the distribution is random. As the magnetic field intensity
increases, the distribution becomes larger near the direction where the c
axis is perpendicular to the field. At the 38.0 kOe magnetic field, the
distribution is sharp at the perpendicular direction to the field.
The distribution of the directions of the crystals is interpreted

--- Page 212 ---

5.1 Magnetic Orientation of Organic and Inorganic Crystals 195
quantitatively by the Boltzmann distribution for variation of the magnetic
field intensity (Section 5.4.3). At thermal equilibrium, the probability that
the crystal exists between the angles 6 and ^ + d^ in the two-dimensional
space is given by
P(e, H)de = exp[-£(^, H)/kT]de/ JJ exp[-£:(0, H) / kT]de (2)
where k is the Boltzmann constant and T the temperature. (The
crystallographic c axis and magnetic fields lie in the horizontal plane
(Section 5.1.2).) The observed results are simulated with Eqs. (1) and (2)
as functions of the variables 6 and H. The calculated results are also shown
in Fig. 5-1-2. The calculation reproduces the observation.
The susceptibility anisotropy is estimated to be
«l;i:i. - ;t:i.I = 3.0 X 10~'^ cm'(crystal"')
The mole number n of molecules contained in the crystal is
« = (4.9±2.2)xl0-''mol
which leads to a size of the crystal of -1.9 x 0.2 x 0.2 |xm. A crystal of
this size is considered to be magnetically oriented against the thermal
disordering.
5.1.6 Magnetic Orientation against Gravity
If the magnetically stable direction is different from the gravitationally
stable direction, what will happen? Can crystals be oriented by the
magnetic field in the direction that the gravitational field does not favor, or
can the magnetic energy be overcome by the gravitational energy? An
example is given in such a case for biphenyl and naphthalene crystals
growing in solution.^^
Biphenyl and naphthalene crystals have a plate form with dimensions
of-10 X 10 X 0.4 (biphenyl) and -10 x 10 x 0.5 (naphthalene) mm. (The
form and dimensions of the crystals are the same between the 80.0 kOe
and zero magnetic fields.) The crystals in the 80.0 kOe horizontal magnetic
field stand at 90 ± 1° angle (vertical), as if they were not sensitive to
gravity, to be oriented in the direction where the normal to the be plane
(plate plane) makes 16 ± 1° (biphenyl) and 21 ± 1° (naphthalene) angles to
the field. The crystals in zero magnetic field lie in random directions.
Similar results are observed for the crystals in the 80.0 kOe vertical
magnetic field. The crystals are oriented in the direction in which the
normal to the be plane is at 16 ± 3° (biphenyl) and 21 ± 2° (naphthalene)
angles to the field.
The crystal structure and magnetic susceptibilities have been reported
for the biphenyl and naphthalene crystals. The crystal system is
monoclinic.

crystals are considered to be oriented with the X\ ^^is parallel to the
magnetic fields. The magnetic orientation takes place in the direction
where the axis of maximum susceptibility is parallel to the magnetic fields
i.e., in the direction where the magnetic energy is the minimum (Section
5.1.4).
Discussions in terms of the potential energy in the magnetic and
gravitational fields on the size of the crystals at which the magnetic
orientation is maintained are made in reference 4.

5,2 Magnetic Field Processing of Organic Polymers and
Composites
Alignment of crystallites, polymer chains, fibers and other substances is a
key issue in many areas of materials processing.'^ A number of methods
including photochemical and mechanical methods have been explored to
achieve alignment. Magnetic alignment has an advantage over other
methods with respect to the uniformity, flexibility and range of materials it
covers.
A simple example of the magnetic alignment is the alignment of
fibers and crystals suspended in a liquid. The alignment of these
substances is described by a simple equation of rotation. Liquid crystals
also align, but the alignment mechanism is complicated because the

--- Page 214 ---

5.2 Magnetic Field Processing of Organic Polymers and Composites 197
aligning unit, which is clearly defined in the case of crystal and fiber
systems, is not well defined. The situation is much more complicated for
the alignment of anisotropic structures forming during the phase transition
that are frequently observed in many materials including crystalline
polymers, polymer gels, supramolecules and others. Anisotropic structures
arising during polymerization in biological systems also undergo magnetic
alignment,^' ^^ but the alignment mechanism appears complicated.
In this section, a number of examples of magnetic alignment are
demonstrated,'^ starting from simple fiber and crystal alignments to much
more complicated ones including the alignment of crystalline polymers
during the crystallization process.
5.2.1 Underlying Principles of Magnetic Alignment of Particles
A particle with anisotropic diamagnetic susceptibility is characterized by
three principal components, x^ < >^2 < ;fi < 0, of the diamagnetic
susceptibility tensor. Upon application of an external static field, the axis
corresponding to the largest component, i.e., ;fi, aligns in the field
direction. The other two axes automatically lie on the plane perpendicular
to the applied field, but they do not exhibit a preferential direction on this
plane. For fibers, two of the components corresponding to the direction
perpendicular to the fiber axis are equal. There are two cases: (i) x^ = /2 <
X\ and (ii) X^ < X^ - X\' The anisotropic diamagnefic susceptibility is
defined as the difference between the components corresponding to the
fiber axis and the direction perpendicular to it, that is, x^ = Xw - X^- This
value is positive for (i) and negative for (ii). Fibers where, x^ > 0' for
example, carbon fibers, poly(ethylene terephthalate) fibers, etc., align with
their fiber axes parallel to the applied field (uniaxial alignment). On the
other hand, fibers in which x^ < 0, for example, polyethylene fibers,
cellulose fibers, etc., align with their fiber axes perpendicular to the
applied field,'*^ but the fiber axes are randomly distributed on the plane
perpendicular to the applied field (planer alignment).
Alignment dynamics is described by the balance of the magnetic
torque and the hydrodynamic torque acting on a particle, whereby the
inertia term is neglected. The dynamics is strongly affected by the shape of
the particle because the hydrodynamic torque resulting from the rotation of
the particle is described by a tensor related to the particle shape. The
complication arising from the particle shape is reduced to some extent in
the case in which one of the principal hydrodynamic axes coincides with
one of the magnetic susceptibility axes. This is the case for plastic fibers
because the fiber axis (one of the hydrodynamic axes) coincides with the
direction of ;fii. The alignment mechanism is the simplest in the case of the
sphere.
In many application areas, the uniaxial alignment of the smallest
principal axis x^ is of great interest. For example, there is a need for a

--- Page 215 ---

198 5 Magnetic Orientation
uniaxial alignment of cellulose fibers. As long as we use static fields, we
do not obtain uniaxial alignment of fibers of jt'a < 0 but only planer
alignment. The rotating magnetic field is a solution to this problem. It is
expected intuitively that the smallest diamagnetic axis tends to align
perpendicular to the plane of the rotation, resulting in uniaxial alignment
of the smallest diamagnetic axis.^^ This idea has been confirmed
theoretically and experimentally.^' Recently, we extended this idea and
demonstrated that three-dimensional alignment of all the susceptibility
axes ;f3, Z2, X\ is possible using an elliptic magnetic field.^'
The balance between the magnetic torque due to the applied field and
the hydrodynamic torque exerted by a viscous medium determines the
rotation motion of a particle.^ ^* The magnetic torque N is expressed as
where B is the magnetic field and V is the volume of the particle under
consideration. Here we assume a particle of prolate ellipsoid with n
coinciding with the long axis. The hydrodynamic torque M acting on the
particle, when it is rotating at an angular velocity fl, is written as
M = -riLQ (2)
where TJ is the viscosity of the medium surrounding the particle and L is a
tensor that is dependent on the particle shape. In the coordinate system
embedded in the particle, L is diagonal, with its principal components
being Li = L2 = L± and L3 = L where the parallel direction corresponds to
the long axis. Equating Eqs. (1) and (2), we obtain
Q = (V/ U)Ho'Xail~\nB)(nxB) (3)
In this case M and Q are parallel. Using the relation dn/dt = 12 x /i, we
obtain the equation of motion of the long axis as follows:
dn/dt = r-\nb)(b-ninb)) (4)
where b is a. unit vector defined by ^ = B/B and r"' is defined as
r' =(V/ L±)i^o^Xori~^B\ In a static field, the temporal change of the angle
^ between n and the applied field is described by tan^ = tan(^o exp(-r/T).
The value of T is experimentally determined using this relation. In the
particular case of a sphere of radius a, we have V/L± = (47t/3)a^/Sna^ = 1/6.
In the present case of a prolate ellipsoid with the aspect ratio of D, we
obtain V/Li = F(D)/6, where F{D) is a complicated function of D.^^
Figure 5-2-1 shows the experimentally determined r values obtained
for various fibers, compared with the theoretical curve F(D). The
experimental data are scaled so that they fall onto the theoretical curve,
with the scaling factor providing the value of jUo'z«^''5"/6. A separate
measurement of x^ shows good agreement with that determined with the
scaling factor.^^

Fig. 5-2-2 Rotating field b applied to a short fiber whose axis is represented by n. The field b rotates at
the angular velocity of (o on the x>' plane.
The alignment behavior of a short nylon fiber with ;^a < 0 under a
rotating magnetic field b = (coscor, sincot, 0) was studied. The geometry of
the experiment is shown in Fig. 5-2-2. The experiment showed that the
angle 6 starting in the vicinity of 90"", decreases to reach 0° after several
revolutions. This means that the fiber axis is aligned in the z direction. The
temporal change of ^ exhibits initial decrease followed by increase,
reaching 90°. ^ is the angle between the fiber axis and the magnetic field;
hence the magnetic energy is minimized when this angle is 90°. This
condition is always satisfied for the field rotating on the xy plane. The
angle (p is the phase delay of the rotation of the fiber axis with respect to
the rotating field. The value of cp becomes constant after several revolutions,

--- Page 217 ---

200 5 Magnetic Orientation
indicating that the fiber rotation follows the rotating field. These behaviors
were in good agreement with the numerical results obtained using Eq. (4).
If the field rotation co is quicker, i.e., cor > 1 , then the fiber cannot follow
the rotation. But in this case the uniaxial alignment of the fiber axis is also
achieved.
If the suspension is composed of many fibers, it is necessary to
consider the interaction between fibers. The interaction may include one
due to the entanglement between fibers and the other due to the interaction
between the induced magnetic dipoles on the fibers. Experimentally, it is
found that fibers can undergo alignment in a concentrated suspension. In
the absence of all these interactions, the following expression is obtained
for the distribution of the angle ^ between the director and the applied
field. Starting with the initial random orientation distribution of fibers, we
can calculate the temporal change in the orientation distribution under a
static magnetic field. The result is shown for the two-dimensional case as^^
Pit) = exp(r/T)sec^(^
2;r(l + exp(2r/T)tan^(^)
Here, r' is the rate of alignment defined previously. This function is
direcdy related to the azimuthal scan in X-ray diffraction measurement.
5.2.2 Magnetic Alignment of Crystals
The discussion made in the previous section is valid for particles having a
volume V large enough to overcome the Brownian motion. A criterion for
the minimum size necessary to exceed the thermal energy is determined by
V = 2k^TnJ\Xa\B~ (6)
With a volume larger than this, the Boltzmann factor determining the ratio
of the alignments parallel and perpendicular to the field becomes larger
than e. Typically, organic crystals under 10 T should have a size larger than
several tens of nanometers to meet the above criterion. If their size is as
large as micrometer order, their degree of alignment is very high even
under moderate magnetic fields generated, for example, by permanent
magnets. The build-up rate of the alignment is estimated by f^ defined
previously. This rate does not depend on the particle size (both magnetic
and hydrodynamic torques are proportional to the particle volume), but it
strongly depends on the shape. Particles with elongated shapes such as
fibers need longer time to reach the alignment because the hydrodynamic
resistance acting on them from the suspending liquid is large compared to
that acting on spherical shapes.
We now show some examples of application. A diffusion-type
polarizer was fabricated using the magnetic alignment of urea crystallites
dispersed in poly(ethyl methacrylate) (PEMA).^^^ The urea crystallites
suspended in a toluene solution of poly(ethyl methacrylate) (PEMA) was

placed in a magnetic field (higher than 0.5 T) and toluene allowed to
evaporate to obtain a PEMA / aligned urea crystal composite film. The
urea crystal exhibits two refractive indices, one for ordinary light (/Zo =
1.484) and the other for extraordinary light (/le = 1.602). The direction of ne
coincides with the crystal c axis. According to the crystal symmetry, the
principal axes of the diamagnetic susceptibility tensor and those of the
refractive index tensor are in a parallel relation. The c axis of the urea
crystal aligns parallel to the field direction, indicating that the c axis
corresponds to one of the principal magnetic susceptibility axes, that is, the
largest one. Since the PEMA has a refractive index {rim = 1.4778) close to
no, the ordinary component of the impinging light is allowed to pass
through, while the extraordinary component is selectively scattered at the
boundary of the polymer matrix and the embedded crystallite. Fig. 5-2-3
shows the image from the polarizing source viewed through the polarizer
prepared by this method.
Another example is the alignment of a crystalline polymer induced
by the epitaxial growth of the polymer chains on the surface of the
magnetically aligned crystallites of a nucleating agent.^'^ Crystallites align
in polymer melts. However, higher magnetic fields are necessary to attain a
quick alignment because the melt viscosity is much higher than the
viscosity of suspensions. Isotactic polypropylene (iPP) was melted with
crystallites of A^,A^'-dicyclohexyl-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxamide
(DCNDCA), a nucleating agent encouraging the epitaxial growth of the p-
phase iPP, under 8 T and subjected to crystallization upon cooling.
DCNDCA did not melt but remained solid during this process. The X-ray
diffraction pattern for the obtained film exhibited the alignment of the fi-
phase iPP. This technique could be used for other combinations of polymer
and nucleating agent.
5.2.3 Magnetic Alignment of Liquid Crystalline Polymers
It is well known that liquid crystalline polymers align easily under

--- Page 219 ---

202 5 Magnetic Orientation
magnetic fields. Unlike the alignment of fibers and crystallites, the
anisotropic structure unit existing in liquid crystalline polymers
responsible for the magnetic alignment is not clearly defined because the
director profile is continuous. However, it is evident that there are large
regions, as observed under microscope, necessary to overcome the thermal
agitation. We may regard the director as being equivalent to the anisotropic
axis n used previously. The temporal evolution of the distribution of the
director upon application of the field is described by Eq. (5). In the case of
a liquid crystalline system, the interaction between directors is very strong,
that is, it is elastic, and hence the validity of Eq. (5) is much more limited^^
than it is when applied to the suspension system.
Control of the alignment is necessary to extract maximum mechanical
performance of liquid crystalline polymers at end-use products. Magnetic
alignment has a number of advantages over other alignment methods
including mechanical shearing and stretching. Because magnetic fields
penetrate into materials, the alignment is attained throughout the bulk. In
addition, the direction and strength of the field are easily controlled in an
arbitrary manner so that the graded alignment,'^' the alignment
perpendicular or inclined to the film surface, etc. are easily realized.
Magnetically and mechanically oriented films of a liquid crystalline
polymer, Rodrun LC-3000, composed of 60 mol% p-hydroxybenzoic acid
and 40 mol% ethylene terephthalate, were prepared and their mechanical
properties studied.'''^ Samples of varying degrees of orientation were
prepared by heat treatment of the film in a magnetic field (6 T) at
temperatures between 231 and 25 TC for 15 to 120 min. The thickness of
the film samples was ca. 100 |im. Since the magnetic field penetrates the
sample, the alignment may be uniform throughout the film thickness.
Mechanically elongated film samples were also prepared. The thickness of
the film samples was ca. 30-50 jiim, which was thin enough to be free of
the skin-core structure. This indicates that the measured mechanical
properties are intrinsic values for a given degree of orientation. In the case
of thicker films, lower values for the properties may be obtained because
the core part is likely to be less oriented than the skin part. This is in
contrast to the magnetically aligned film. The orientation degree was
determined using the half width of the X-ray azimuthal peak. The elastic
modulus, tensile strength and elongation to break were measured. The
comparison of the elastic modulus demonstrated that the magnetic method
was as powerful as mechanical method. The other mechanical properties
exhibited differences between magnetic and mechanical methods. These
differences were attributed to the difference in microscopic morphology.
5.2.4 Magnetic Alignment of Crystalline Polymers
Unlike liquid crystalline polymers, crystalline polymers were considered to
be unable to align under magnetic fields because they lack stable

--- Page 220 ---

5.2 Magnetic Field Processing of Organic Polymers and Composites 203
anisotropic structures, such as liquid crystalline phases, capable of
responding to the applied field. However, we have found'^ that many
crystalline polymers including poly(ethylene-2,6-naphthalate), isotactic
polystyrene,'"^^ isotactic polypropylene, poly (ethylene terephthalate),
paraffin, poly(ethylene oxide), polyetherester, polycarbonate and cellulose
triacetate, align magnetically under the appropriate conditions.
The alignment occurs during the transition between solid and liquid
such as crystallization from melt as well as melting from crystal. In line
with the previous discussion about the magnetic alignment of fibers,
crystallites and liquid crystalline polymers, we should assume that some
anisotropic structures of appropriate size surrounded by a low viscosity
circumstance exists or forms during the transition. In the field of polymer
crystallization, anistropic structures forming during the induction period of
crystallization are an issue of intense discussions.'''^ These structures, which
we refer to as the mesophase, may be responsible for the magnetic
alignment. The mesophase may include crystal embryos, condis crystals,
nematic-like structures, etc. Current understanding of the magnetic
alignment of crystalline polymers is as follows. The mesophase existing or
forming during the transition between the melt and the crystal aligns upon
exposure to the magnetic field. This oriented mesophase acts as the nuclei
of subsequent crystallization, resulting in the formation of aligned
crystallites.
A general thermal scheme used to attain magnetic alignment during
melt crystallization is shown in Fig. 5-2-4. Here, the field is applied
throughout the entire process. A solid sample is heated from room
temperature to a maximum melting temperature Tmax above the melting
point Tm. Then the sample is kept melted for a period of fm, followed by
cooling to the temperature T^ for the crystallization. An in situ magnetic
birefringence measurement was carried out for poly(ethylene
terephthalate) (PET) under 6 T.'^' The parameters for the thermal treatment
were T^ = 26 rC, r^ax = 270°C, T, = 250°C and tm = 5 min. A polarizer and
an analyzer were set under the crossed polar condition, each forming an
angle of 45° or -45° with respect to the vertical magnetic field of 6 T.
Under this condition, the transmitting light intensity is proportional to
sin\KdAn/X), where d is the sample thickness. An is the birefringence and A
is the wavelength (632.8 nm) of the impinging light (He-Ne laser). The
quantity dAn is referred to as retardation. If the increase in An due to the
magnetic alignment of the polymer chain is large, the intensity could
oscillate.
The in situ birefringence measurement exhibited oscillation, starting
at a very early stage of crystallization (crystallization time of ca. 5 min),
clearly indicating that the alignment occurred. In order to investigate at
which stage of crystallization the alignment started, wide angle X-ray
measurements were carried out for the samples quenched at various times

of crystallization. The X-ray results demonstrated that the crystal
formation detectable by X-ray diffraction started at around 20 min. This
was far later than the start of the alignment detected by the birefringence
method (ca. 5 min). This observation leads us to the conclusion that the
origin of the alignment is not the crystal (at least as detectable by X-rays)
but the mesophase.
5.2.5 Nonrotation T^pe Magnetic Alignment of Crystalline Polymers
So far the alignment mechanism is described in terms of the magnetic
torque acting on a magnetically anisotropic particle. However, this is not
the only way of describing the phenomenon. Another possibility, referred
to as preferential alignment,'^^ is based on the shift in the transition
temperature due to the applied magnetic field. The shift in this model is
similar to the shift in the melting point due to the pressure. The chemical
potential of the mesophase depends on the mutual direction of the
anisotropic axis of the mesophase with respect to the direction of the
applied field. Therefore, there are two intersections corresponding to the
melting points of the mesophase aligned parallel and perpendicular to the
applied field, respectively. This results in a preferential melting of the
mesophase of lower melting point upon heating and a preferential
crystallization of the mesophase of higher melting point upon cooling,
leading to alignment.
The details of the model are as follows. The model assumes that (i) a
stable mesophase exists between the melt and crystalline phases, (ii)
intersection of the crystal- and mesophase-chemical potential lines and the
intersection of the mesophase- and melt-chemical potential lines define the
melting point Tm (determined by conventional thermal analysis) and the
equilibrium melting point Tm, respectively, (iii) the transition enthalpy AH
from mesophase to melt is extremely small compared to that from crystal
to mesophase and (iv) the shift in T^ due to the presence of the magnetic
field as expressed by the Magneto-Clapeyron equation.'^^ On the basis of

Figure 5-2-5 shows the plot of the -AH/AF, which corresponds to
the logarithm of the secondary nucleation (i.e., growth) rate of mesophase,
as a function of reduced crystallization temperature TR for various values of
5TR. It should be noted that the rate is zero at TR = 1. It should also be noted
that the rate becomes significantly reduced at low temperatures due to the
diffusion term. The rate becomes zero at the glass transition temperature TR
= 2/3. In most cases, the maximum appears around TR = 5/6. It is clear
from the figure that the magnetic field preferentially accelerates the growth
of the mesophase with a parallel orientation to the field (in the case of ;ifa >
0), while the growth rate of the mesophase with a perpendicular orientation
is suppressed. This tendency is especially enhanced in the vicinity of the
equilibrium melting point. In addition, the growth rate for the parallel
orientation is larger than that in the absence of the field, indicating that the
crystallization is apparently accelerated in the magnetic field. Similar
statements are also valid for the primary nucleation. Incidentally, magnetic
aUgnment experiments are usually carried out at ca. TR = 0.9 to 0.95.
5.2.6 Conclusion
Magnetic alignment of feeble magnetic materials has been described.

--- Page 223 ---

206 5 Magnetic Orientation
Particle alignment is governed by factors including field strength, viscosity
of the surrounding medium, and the size, shape and magnetic anisotropy of
the particle. Of course, high fields (10 T or higher) are better, especially
when trying to find new phenomena, but moderate fields such as those
obatained by permanent magnets are sufficient to align particles if other
parameters such as the size of the particle are in favor of the alignment.
For typical anisotropic diamagnetic particles (j^a of 10"^), the minimum size
required to overcome the thermal agitation under 10 T is of the order of
sub-micrometers. The viscosity of the surrounding medium determines the
alignment speed. The volume of the particle does not come into the
alignment speed because both magnetic and hydrodynamic torques are
proportional to the volume. In a medium with low viscosity such as water,
the particle aligns almost instantaneously. The shape of the particle affects
the alignment speed. The speed is reduced by the square of the aspect ratio
of the fiber in comparison to the sphere. The alignment of particles of
micrometer size with large x^ suspended in a low viscosity medium,
followed by solidification of the medium may be best fitted to industrial
processes. This will work with a moderate field.
Magnetic alignment of anisotropic phases forming during the phase
transition is complicated compared to the particle alignment because the
size, shape and magnetic anisotropy of the aligning unit can change during
the transition. In addition, another possible mechanism is proposed. A
preferential crystallization or melting could occur because the stability of
the phase depends on the orientation direction of the anisotropic phase
with respect to the field. In order for this phenomenon to happen, the
transition enthalpy must be very small. It appears that no experimental
evidence has been presented so far.
Time-dependent magnetic fields such as circular and elliptic
magnetic fields are unique and useful for achieving alignment which is
never possible with a static magnetic field. The circular field enables the
alignment of hard magnetization axis in the direction perpendicular to the
circulating plane. The elliptic magnetic field enables the three-dimensional
alignment of the susceptibility axes, making it possible to turn crystalline
powders into a pseudo-single crystal.

5.3 Magnetic Alignment of Polymer Gels
5.3.1 Polymer Gels
The magnetic alignment, magnetic field effects on the phase transition and
some applications are introduced for polymer gels. It is expected that
magnetic energy becomes large enough to induce some chemical and
physical effects if a species of high molecular weight is exposed to a
strong magnetic field. Polymers consist of long chains of organic
compounds and are diamagnetic with anisotropic susceptibility. This
magnetic property leads to magnetically aligned polymers, e.g., liquid
crystal, agarose gel and fibrinogen protein.' ^^ The best known natural
vegetable gel is agar, whose main component is agarose. The
polysaccharide agarose consists of P-D-galactose and 3,6-anhydoro-a-L-
galactose. The agarose gel is used for cell cultivation in the field of biology
and for the supporting medium of the electrophoresis in the field of
medicine. Agarose is classified into several types according to the sol-gel
phase transition temperature and elasticity. The aqueous solution shows a
thermo-reversible sol-gel phase transition with a thermal hysteresis. The
agarose gel melts to form a solution at elevated temperatures and gelation
occurs at room temperature. A gelation model in the cooling process has
been suggested^^: the shape of the chains is changed from a random coil at
elevated temperatures to an a-helix at moderate temperatures. Then, the
two helices intertwine to form the double helix. Many double helices are
assembled and aligned to form high concentration regions called domains.
Linkages between the domains are generated and the solution is progresses
to form the gel at the gelation temperature. The transition temperature is
about Tg = 310 K for gelation, and Tm = 350 K for melting for the typical
agarose solution. In addition, the agarose gel indicates the gel-gel volume
transition in acetone aqueous solution: the gel shrinks in a high
concentration solution.

--- Page 225 ---

208 5 Magnetic Orientation
Interesting phase transitions have been reported for other gels. For
example, aqueous solution of methyl cellulose forms the gel at elevated
temperatures in contrast to the agarose gel. Acrylamid gel exhibits a large
volume transition: the gel shrinks below 30-40°C and the volume ratio
reaches over 100. Other factors such as electric field and pH can lead to
phase transitions of the gel. Many functional gels are under development.
5.3.2 Magnetic Field Effect for Agarose Gel
The gel-sol phase transition temperatures were investigated for the agarose
gel formed in magnetic fields. Cryocooled superconducting magnets (Type
SM-5, Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd. and Type JMTD-10 TlOO NC-
mkll, JASTEC) and the hybrid magnet (NIMS, Tsukuba) were used to
apply the magnetic fields. The temperature was controlled to form the gel
by using a water jacket set in the bore of the magnet. Homogeneity of the
magnetic field was less than 3% in a space of ±25 mm at the center of the
magnet. The raw materials used were Agarose type II with a gel strength of
6000-8000 kg m-^ and type L with 4500 kg m' supplied by Wako
Chemicals. They are a special grade for electrophoresis. The molecular
weight was 55 x 10^ gram. The mixture of the agarose powder and
distilled water was prepared at various concentrations of up to 4.0 wt% and
stirred at room temperature. Five thermal cycles, heating and cooling, were
repeated for homogenization before measurement.
5.3.3 Magnetic Field Effects on Phase Transition Temperature
A hot solution of agarose II was poured into a Pyrex-glass tube with ID =
3 mm, OD = 5 mm and / = 50 mm. Each sample tube enclosed a stainless-
steel made micro-ball with a diameter of 2 mm to determine the melting
temperature by the ball-drop method. Then the inlet of the tube was sealed
by burner. The sample tubes containing the hot solution were set in a water
jacket in the bore of the vertical type magnet to control the temperature.
Ten samples were placed at the center of the magnet and the other ten 600
mm below the center of the magnet, the bottom of the water jacket. When
the applied magnetic field is 5 T at the center, the field is less than 0.01 T
at the bottom position with no magnetic field. The samples were cooled to
form the gel at a rate of -0.3 K min"' through the water jacket by
temperature-controlled water. After gelation the twenty samples were taken
out of the magnet at zero field at room temperature. Then the tubes were
turned over and set into a hot-water bath controlled at room temperature.
The melting temperature of the gel was measured by the ball-dropping
method. With increasing bath temperature at a rate of +0.03 K, the gel
changed to the sol at melting temperature. Then the micro-ball dropped,
taking about 0.5 s. The melting temperature was determined at the moment
the micro-ball dropped 20 mm from the original position.

temperature Tm of the agarose gel. The averaged temperature was Tm =
80.8°C for 0.5 wt% reference gel.^^^^ The magnetic-exposed gel melted at
Tm = 81.8°C. An increase in the melting temperature by ATm = +1.0 K was
observed as the magnetic field effect of ^ = 5 T. The melting temperature
increased with increasing exposed fields but saturated at around a
magnetic field of 3 T. The same tendency was observed for the 0.3 wt%
agarose gel.'^^ The magnetic field effect on the melting temperature was
not detected for the 1.5 wt% gel but became large for dilute gels.
Meanwhile, the melting temperatures of methyl cellulose gels decreased
with increasing exposed magnefic fields.^ ^^* The results for both gels
indicate that the gel was stabilized thermally when it was formed in strong
magnetic fields.
Magnetic fields were applied to investigate which gelation process
was influenced to change the melting temperature by the fields. The
agarose solution was exposed to a magnetic field of 5 T in a limited
temperature range in the cooling process, for example, between 45°C and
40°C. The higher broken line and the lower dotted line in Fig. 5-3-2
indicate the melting temperature of the gel formed under the influence of
magnetic fields of 5 T and 0 T, respectively. In the case of the magnetic
exposure above 45°C, the effect was not observed because of the small Ax
of each random coil. When the gel was exposed to a magnetic field of 5 T
below 35°C, the effect was also not obtained because of strong network
interdomains of the gel. The magnetic field effect on the melting
temperature of the gel was found for the temperature range between 45 °C
and 35°C, especially 45°C and 40°C. This melting temperature was close

to that for 5 T, as shown by the broken line in Fig. 5-3-2." '^^ At a
temperature around 40°C, the structure of the solution is considered to be
such that the self-oriented domains have a large anisotropic susceptibility
but the inter-domain linkage has not progressed. Therefore, the domains
were easy to rotate by a magnetic field of 5 T. The same tendency was
observed for 0.3 wt% gel.^"^ '^^ The most effective zone also appeared at
around 40°C. It is well known that the phase transition temperature
depended on the cooling rate, and the quenched agarose gel indicates low
melting temperature.^^ The domain growth process is necessary to give a
high melting temperature. Accordingly, it is concluded that the strong
magnetic field helped to generate and/or grow the domains.
5.3.4 Optical Measurements
To investigate the magnetic induced alignment of agarose molecules the
birefringence was measured optically.'^ '^^ The sample gel was prepared in
an optical cell with a 10 mm path. The extinction angle was measured with
an accuracy of 0.1 deg by the Senarmont method. The birefringence An
was measured for 4.0 wt% agarose L gel formed in the magnetic fields.
The values of An were investigated at ten points for each gel. The averaged
value was plotted in Fig. 5-3-3 as a function of the magnetic field exposed.
The birefringence was very small, but it increased with increasing
magnetic field and saturated at around 3 T. The saturation tendency agreed
with the magnetic field effect on the melting temperature of the agarose gel
shown in Fig. 5-3-1. Meanwhile, the birefringence was measured for the
gel formed at 5 T as a function of the gel concentration up to 4 wt%. The

birefringence increased linearly with increasing gel concentration up to
2 wt% and its gradient decreased above 3 wt%J^^ These results are direct
evidence of the magnetic alignment of agarose molecules. The magnetic
alignment depends on the strength of the field exposed and the
concentration of the gel.
5.3.5 Applications
Changes in the melting temperature and the birefringence suggest
anisotropic change in the network structure of the gel. The agarose gel
shows a volume transition in the acetone-water system. Volume expansion
and shrinkage is observed at around 70 wt% acetone. The volume
transition was measured for 4 wt% agarose gel formed in the magnetic
field of 10 T. In the experiment, the gel was prepared in capillary tubes
with ID = 1.0 mm and / = 50 mm, and the tubes were situated parallel or
perpendicular to the magnetic field of 10 T. The length of the gel was
measured as a function of acetone concentration at zero field at room
temperature. The length decreased with increasing acetone concentration
for gels of both tubes, and remarkable shrink was observed at a
concentration of 70 wt%, as shown in Fig. 5-3-4.^^^ Both shrink ratios were
saturated at around 80 wt%. The length of the gels after the shrinkage
differed from each other: the lengths parallel and perpendicular to the
magnetic field were 92% and 94%, respectively. This anisotropic
shrinkage occurs in the structure of the anisotropic network rather than in
the anisotropic structure of the domain region of the gel. The viscoelastic
measurements using an ultrasonic wave indicated anisotropic increase in
the elasticy in the gel and the hard direction was perpendicular to the
magnetic field exposed. The same tendency of anisotropic volumetric
phase transition was discovered for the NIPA gels. Therefore, the direction

of the volumetric expansion and shrink is controllable by using magnetic
fields.
The aligned gel suggests a new application of electrophoresis. The
agarose gel was used as the support media (substrate) in gel electrophoresis
of DNA. The experimental results for the agarose gel indicate that the use
of strong magnetic fields controls not only the alignment of agarose

molecules but also the anisotropic network structure of the gel. Indeed, the
electrophoretic velocity of DNA increased in the aligned gel media as
shown in Fig. 5-3-5.'^^^^ The tendency of the increase in the velocity
depended on the shape of the DNA. The electrophoretic voltage dependence
on the velocity was different between linear DNA and plasmid DNA.
Moreover, anisotropic velocity of DNA was observed in the aligned gel.^"^
It was also found that the electrophoretic velocity of DNA in the gel
decreased under the influence of the magnetic field because the DNA was
aligned perpendicularly to the magnetic field.*^' ^'^^ A new separation
method of DNA is anticipated using these unique alignment properties of
gel and DNA. Use of magnetically aligned gel expands the applications of
gel.

5.4 Magnetic Alignment of Multi-wall Carbon Nanotubes
5.4.1 Orientation of Carbon Nanotubes
Carbon nanotubes are large (> 1 jim) and have an ordered (anisotropic)
structure. They satisfy the conditions for magnetic orientation (Section
5.1.1) and are indeed oriented in magnetic fields.^^^
A suspension of carbon nanotubes was placed in horizontal magnetic
fields, and the solvent was vaporized. The scanning electron microscope
(SEM) image of the nanotubes in the 80.0 kOe magnetic field is shown in
Fig. 5-4-1(a). The nanotubes are 1.5 ± 0.6 |im in length and are oriented
with the tube axis parallel to the field. The spherical regions seem to be
amorphous graphitic nanoparticles produced as by-products in carbon arc
discharge. An SEM image of the nanotubes in zero field is shown in Fig. 5-
4-1(b). The nanotubes are directed randomly.
A transmission electron microscope (TEM) image of nanotubes was
observed. The outermost and innermost tubules are 17.9 ± 4.4 and 2.8 ±
1.2 nm in diameter, respectively. The wall thickness is 23 ± 7 sheets, and
the intershell distance is 0.349 ± 0.005 nm. On the assumption that the
concentric tubules have a uniform length within the nanotube, the mole
number of carbon atoms contained in the nanotube is calculated to be
Az = (7.6±4.4)xl0-*'mol
The magnetic orientation of the carbon nanotubes is analyzed
qualitatively by the magnetic anisotropy energy (Section 5.1.4). The
nanotube is magnetically symmetric along the tube axis and possesses
molar susceptibilities parallel (jfii) and perpendicular (XL) to it. When the
nanotube composed of a mole number n of carbon atoms is placed in a
magnetic field //, the magnetic energy is given by
£(0,//) = -(n//-/2)[;^x+(/„-/i)cos^^] (1)
where 6 is the angle between the tube axis and field H {-nil < 6 < KI2).
The magnetic orientation takes place in the direction where the magnetic
energy E{0, H) is minimum. Since the nanotubes are oriented with the tube
axis parallel to the field {0 = 0), the susceptibilities are shown to hold the
relation Xi < Xw-

The proportion of oriented carbon nanotubes in magnetic fields depends on
the magnetic field intensity. The relation between the magnetic orientation
and magnetic field intensity is discussed for nanotubes in magnetic fields
(0-80.0 kOe);^
The distribution of the angles that the tube axis makes to the
magnetic fields is shown in Fig. 5-4-2. At zero field, the nanotubes are in
random directions. As the magnetic field intensity is stronger, the
proportion of the nanotubes increases near the direction where the tube
axis is parallel to the field, and the width of the distribution narrows near

5.4.3 Magnetic Orientation and Thermal Disordering: Boltzmann
Distribution
Consider a molecule possessing an axis Z of magnetic symmetry and

--- Page 234 ---

5.4 Magnetic Alignment of Multi-wall Carbon Nanotubes 217
placed in a magnetic field H, The simplest case is one in which both the
axis Z and field H are restricted in a two-dimensional space. Since the axis
Z moves in the two-dimensional plane, the degree of freedom is 1 (one) for
the direction of the molecule, which is specified by the rotation angle 0
about the normal to that plane. (The magnetic energy E{e, H) is a
continuous function of the variable 6.) The directions of the molecules
follow the Boltzmann statistics at thermal equilibrium, and the probability
that the molecule exists between the angles 6 and ^ + d^ at temperature T is
written as
P(eM)de = cxp[-E(eM)/kT]de/ T' Q^p[-E(e.H)/kT]de (2)
J-7t/2
with k being the Boltzmann constant. The overall susceptibility anisotropy
n (Xw - Z-L) of the molecule is the only parameter involved in Eqs. (1) and
(2), and determined by simulation of the experimental results.
The physical meaning of the Boltzmann distribution for the
directions of the molecules is explained as follows. While the magnetic
field intensity is weak, the difference in the magnetic energy E(0, H) - £(0,
H) is small between any direction {0) and the magnetically stable direction
{e - 0). The distribution is disordered to be random by the thermal energy,
and has a wide width. The molecules exist in magnetically unstable
directions by the thermal motion and are not oriented. As the magnetic
field intensity grows stronger, the difference in the magnetic energy
becomes larger. The distribudon has a higher probability and narrower
width near the magnetically stable direction. When the difference in the
magnetic energy "exceeds" the thermal energy, the molecules are oriented
in the magnetically stable direction against the thermal disordering.
The reasonable approximation is that the carbon nanotubes lie in the
horizontal plane and are affected by the horizontal magnetic fields.
Calculation can be made to simulate the observed results for the
distribution of the directions of the nanotubes using Eqs. (1) and (2) as
functions of the variables 0 and H. The calculated results are also shown in
Fig. 5-4-2. The calculation reproduces the observation. Thus, the magnetic
orientation of the nanotubes is explained quantitatively by the Boltzmann
distribution for variation of the magnetic field intensity.
5.4.4 Estimation of Magnetic Anisotropy by Magnetic Orientation
The magnetic susceptibility anisotropy of the carbon nanotubes is assumed
to be independent of the field intensity (5.0-80.0 kOe). The susceptibility
anisotropy is estimated by simulation of the experimental results as'^

magnetometer. The reported values are listed in Table 5-4-1.
With respect to the anisotropy of susceptibilities, a positive sign (xw -
XL > 0) was offered by the magnetic orientation experiment^^ and the three
SQUID measurements,^"^^ but a negative sign {x^ - ;^i < 0) was suggested
by the three other SQUID measurements."^^^ (The values of the
susceptibilities are different among the observations.) Whether the
nanotubes are isolated or not should address an explanation to the
discrepancy. The magnetic orientation experiment'^ was performed for a
single nanotube which was free and separated ultrasonically from the
others in the suspension. This technique has the advantage of enabling the
observation of the magnetic properties of a single nanotube. The three
SQUID measurements"^^^ were done for bundles and films where
nanotubes were agglomerated and formed a loop by local connections. If a
diamagnetic current is induced and circulated around the loop against the
magnetic fields, the susceptibilities would be estimated differently from
those in the isolated conditions.
5.4.5 Temperature Dependence of Magnetic Orientation
The probability that the carbon nanotubes are oriented in the magnetic
fields depends on the temperature."* The probability of magnetic orientation
increases when the temperature is raised from 231 to 314 K. The
temperature dependence of the magnetic orientation for the nanotubes
cannot be explained by the Boltzmann distribution where the magnetic
orientation is suppressed by the thermal disordering. Instead, the increase
in the probability of the magnetic orientation is understood in terms of an
increase in the susceptibility anisotropy with the rise in temperature. If the
susceptibility anisotropy is larger at the higher temperature, the
stabilization of the magnetic energy is larger, and the probability of the
magnetic orientation is larger at the higher temperature. Thus, the
susceptibility anisotropy of the nanotubes is suggested to increase when
the temperature is raised from 231 to 314 K.

5.5 Magnetic Alignment of Single-walled Carbon Nanotubes and
Nanocomposites
Controlled single-walled nanotube (SWNT) alignment is critical for both
structural and multifunctional applications of SWNT-based structures and
materials. The research indicates that SWNT materials have certain
magnetic susceptibilities due to their unique molecular structures/'^^ For
instance, the molar magnetic susceptibilities for a (10, 10) SWNT
(armchair) is about +85.4 x 10"^ emu mor'C' when parallel to B
(magnetic vector), and -21.0 x 10^ emu mor^C"' when perpendicular to
B, Theoretical predictions show that for a (10, 10) SWNT 300 nm long, a
magnetic field of 10-25 T can align SWNTs suspended in a very low
viscous solution. Smalley's team experimentally demonstrated the
effectiveness of aligning SWNTs in buckypapers within high magnetic
fields of greater than 8 T.^'^^ Tanimoto's group also successfully observed
the magnetic alignment of carbon nanotubes in high magnetic fields.^^ ''^^
In this study, a new technical approach was developed by the authors
to prepare bulk polymeric composites containing in-plane aligned
nanotubes using magnetically aligned SWNT buckypaper materials. The
alignment of SWNTs in high magnetic fields for fabricating aligned
buckypapers is the result of the complicated interactions of nanotube
anisotropic magnetic susceptibility, strength of magnetic field, nanotube
dispersion, surfactant, self-assembly, temperature, flow rate of filtration,
etc. Among these factors, concentration of tube suspension and strength of
magnetic field are the most significant parameters for achieving a high
degree of alignment and efficiency for producing quality aligned
buckypapers in magnetic fields. To demonstrate the influences of
suspension concentration and strength of magnetic field on SWNT
alignment, the authors conducted a series of experiments to produce large

220 5 Magnetic Orientation
magnetically aligned buckypapers (387 cm^ or 60 in'^ working area) of
varying tube concentrations (10, 20, 40 and 100 mg f^) and magnetic
strengths (5, 10 and 17.3 T). The anisotropy ratios between the electrical
resistivity perpendicular and parallel to the tube alignment direction of the
magnetically aligned buckypapers were measured to reveal nanotube
alignment. It was discovered that the higher the value of the ratio, the
better the tube alignment in the resultant buckypapers.
Finally, a special resin infiltration technique was also developed to
facilitate tube/epoxy resin impregnation and to cure the multiple-layer
resin-wetted aligned buckypaper into bulk solid composite samples.
Significant alignment of nanotubes in the buckypapers was observed using
the scanning electronic microscope (SEM). Dynamic mechanical analysis
(DMA) shows that the storage modulus of the quasi-unidirectional SWNT
composite sample was as high as 40.5 GPa. The SEM observations of the
cross-section of the resultant composite also showed significant alignment
of the nanotubes along the desired direction, which indicated that tube
alignment in the magnetically aligned buckypaper was successfully
transferred to the solid nanocomposites.
5.5.1 Fabrication of Magnetically Aligned Buckypapers Using
Syringe Filters
Smalley and his group first experimentally demonstrated the effectiveness
of producing magnetically aligned buckypapers by aligning SWNTs in
water/Triton-X solutions under high magnetic fields. By in situ filtering
well-dispersed SWNT suspensions in a high strength magnetic field, his
team produced buckypapers of magnetically aligned SWNTs. Raman
spectroscopy measurements indicated that the alignment of carbon
nanotubes in the direction of the magnetic field had an axial orientation
within 17 ± 1° of the magnetic field axis. The SEM observations also
confirmed good tube alignment in the magnetically aligned buckypapers.
The present authors first fabricated small samples following
Smalley's method to validate the effectiveness of nanotube alignment in
magnetically aligned buckypapers. Millipore Millex-GN syringe filters of
25 mm in diameter and 0.45 |im pore size were used in the experiments.
The filter was placed inside the bore of the magnet, which generates the
magnetic field. The magnets used in our experiments were at the National
High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL), Tallahassee, FL. The bore
sizes of the magnets were 50 mm outer diameter (O.D) for the 25-T
magnet and 195 mm O.D for the 20-T magnet. When the tube suspension
passed through the filter, the nanotubes aligned in the direction of the
magnetic field and deposited on the membrane of the filter to form
buckypaper of aligned nanotube networks. After cleaning and drying, the
magnetically aligned buckypaper produced was peeled from the filter
membrane. Torn strips of the produced buckypaper resulted in heavy

curvatures indicating significant alignment of the SWNTs. The AFM images
confirmed the tube alignment in the magnetically aligned buckypaper
produced under 15-25-T magnetic fields, as shown in Fig. 5-5-1.
5.5.2 Fabrication of Large Magnetically Aligned Buckypaper Using
Custom Cylinder Filters
A. Experimental Setup
Millex-GN syringe Millipore filters used in the experiments were very
small and did not yield enough samples for further testing and
nanocomposite fabrication. The filter had a diameter of only 25 mm (0.984
in) and an area of 4.9 cm" (0.969 in*^). To make a larger magnetically
aligned buckypaper, a tubular filter was custom designed to make
buckypaper of approximately 38 cm (15 in) long and 10 cm (3.94 in) wide,
resulting in an area of 387 cm^ (60 in').
Nonmagnetic materials were required for all parts of the custom-
designed filter for use inside a high strength magnet of 5-25 T. Any
magnetic materials, such as steel, could damage the filter apparatus as well
as the magnet. Aluminum was used for making the filter. The design
requirements for the filter were constrained by the size of the magnet bore
and area covered by the magnetic field in Cell 5 at the NHMFL. The
diameter of the magnet bore was 190 mm. The depth of the bore was
1,165.2 mm and the magnetic field was centered at 582.6 mm. Allowing
for clearance, the maximum diameter of the filter assembly was less than
172 mm (6.75 in). The total length of the filter could vary but the
membrane remained within 76 mm (-3.0 in) from the magnetic center,
which maintained good uniformity of magnetic strength. A total filter
length of 152 mm (-6.0 in) was used.
The detailed filter design is shown in Fig. 5-5-2. Three parts made up

the external filter assembly: End Cap A, End Cap B and the External
CyUnder. Five parts made up the internal filter assembly: Internal Cap C,
Internal Cap D, Flange C, Flange D and the rolled perforated tube, as
shown in Fig. 5-5-2. When these components were assembled, they formed
the structure upon which the Millipore filter membrane of 0.45 |im pore
size was attached to the surface of the preformed tube surface. A 5/16"-18
threaded rod bolted the internal filter assembly together. End Cap B was
then bolted to the External Cylinder to form a watertight chamber. The
nylon membrane of 0.45 |Lim pore size, made by the Millipore Corporation,
has a standard width of 15 cm and a length of 300 cm (Product ID:
INYUOOOIO). Once the flanges C and D were attached to the rolled and
perforated tube, the length of the inner (internal) filter assembly became
approximately 13.5 cm. The membrane was cut so that the length of the
membrane was 5 cm more than the circumference of the internal filter
assembly. The filter membrane was wrapped onto the inner filter assembly
and a layer of double-sided permanent tape was applied on the inner side
of the membrane. The membrane was sealed using West System fast cure
epoxy glue. The outer edges of the membrane were attached to flanges C
and D using double-sided permanent tape. A silicone gasket was placed on
the internal cap C. Silicone glue was uniformly applied on the outer
periphery of the inner filter assembly and was then placed on the internal
cap C. A silicone gasket was placed on the internal cap D and silicone glue
was applied on the gasket. The internal cap D was then placed onto the
inner filter assembly. The end cap D was placed on flange D and tightened
using a nut and bolt. The inner assembly, external cylinder and end caps A
and B were then attached using nuts and bolts.

B. Fabrication of Large Magnetically Aligned Buckypapers
The assembled filter was used to fabricate large magnetically aligned
buckypapers. The experiments revealed that suspensions frequently broke
down due to the peristaltic motion and long filtration time. To ensure that a
stable suspension could be kept throughout the filtration, an in situ
sonication system was used in subsequent experiments. In this way, the
suspension was resonicated just before entering the filtration system,
ensuring good tube dispersion and stable suspension.
C. Large Magnetically Aligned SWNT Buckypapers
The world's largest magnetically aligned buckypapers were successfully
produced in the research, as shown in Fig. 5-5-3. The buckypapers produced
have a working area more than 387 cm^ (60 in*^) and approximately 15-
30 |Lim thick. Good tube alignment was observed. The successful
development of this large aligned buckypaper fabrication approach
provides the possibility for producing sizable devices and bulk
nanocomposite samples with in-plane controlled tube orientation.
5.5.3 Investigation of SWNT Alignment in Magnetically Aligned
Buckypapers
The alignment of SWNTs in high magnetic fields for fabricating aligned
buckypaper is the result of complicated interactions of tube anisotropic
magnetic susceptibility, strength of magnetic field, tube dispersion,
surfactant, tube self-assembly, temperature and filtration flow rate. Among
these impact factors, concentration of tube suspension and strength of
magnetic field are the most important parameters for achieving a high
degree of alignment and efficiently producing magnetically aligned
buckypapers. They are critical for controlling tube alignment quality and

reducing electrical consumption during the process. To systematically
reveal the influences of suspension concentration and magnetic field
strength, the authors conducted a series of experiments to produce large
magnetically aligned buckypapers (387 cm*^ working area) of different tube
concentrations (10, 20, 40 and 100 mg r^) and varying magnetic strengths
(5, 10 and 17.3 T). The anisotropy ratios of the electrical resistivity of the
resultant buckypapers were characterized using the four-probe method
with a specially designed fixture. The authors also examined the
nanostructures of the produced buckypapers to understand the
relationships between tube alignment and electrical resistivity.
The electrical resistivity anisotropy of the aligned buckypaper
samples was calculated as follows:
^, . 1T^ • . . . . Resistivity perpendicular to B
Electncal ResisUvity Anisotropy = "^-^—
Resistivity parallel to B
Due to the isotropic nature of SWNTs, it was found that the higher the
anisotropy ratio of electrical resistivity, the better the tube alignment in
magnetically aligned buckypapers.
A. Influences of Suspension Concentration
Figure 5-5-4 shows the influences of the suspension concentration on the
anisotropy ratios of the magnetically aligned buckypapers, which were
produced with a 17.3-T magnetic field. The figure shows that the
anisotropy of the buckypaper was fairly constant for the samples made
with suspensions of concentration from 10 to 40 mg 1"'; however, the
anisotropy ratio of the buckypaper decreased sharply as the SWNT
suspension concentration increased from 40 to 100 mg !"'. The SEM
observations indicate obvious differences between tube networks of 40 and
100 mg r' buckypapers, as shown in Figs. 5-5-5 and -6. The preferred tube

packing can be seen in buckypapers made with the 40 mg r' suspension. In
the buckypaper made with the 100 mg r' suspension, the tube network
formed was random and relatively loose, which may be because the tubes
cannot easily move and align due to poor tube dispersion and intensive
tube-tube interactions in high concentration suspensions.
B. Influences of Magnetic Field Strength
Figure 5-5-7 shows the influences of magnetic field strength on the
anisotropy ratios of the magnetically aligned buckypapers produced with
the suspension concentration of 40 mg r\ The results illustrate that the

applied magnetic field strength has a direct impact on tube alignment in
the buckypapers produced. The anisotropy ratios increase almost linearly
with increase in magnetic field strength.
The SEM observations show that the tube rope diameter increased
and alignment improved with increase in field magnetic strength. In the 5-
T aligned sample, almost random networks of fine tube ropes are observed,
while for the 10-T sample, we can see relatively large and continuous tube
ropes. Significant tube alignment in the internal layer is found by peeling
the aligned buckypaper produced with the 17.3-T field.
5.5.4 Nanocomposites with In-plane Aligned SWNT
A. Fabrication of Nanocomposites Using Magnetically Aligned
Buckypapers
Wetting or impregnating buckypapers with epoxy resin is far more difficult
than processing conventional fiber-reinforced composites because of the
buckypaper's nanoscale porous structures and the intensive molecular
interactions between SWNTs and resin molecules. The resin matrix used in
this research was Epon 862/EPI-CURE W curing agent supplied by Shell
Chemical Co. The resin's viscosity was as high as 2700 cP at room
temperature, preventing infiltration through the buckypapers along their
thickness direction even under a full vacuum. The thickness of the
buckypaper was only 15-30 |im. Only very low viscosity resin solution
could infiltrate through and wet the SWNT networks of the buckypapers.
More than two hours were required for the diluted resin solution with
viscosity below 10 cP to properly infiltrate through a 15 jim-thick
buckypaper along the thickness direction. Multiple layers of the well-
impregnated buckypapers were stacked together and cured at Xll^'C for
two hours, then post-cured for an additional two hours at 177°C to

fabricate the final bulk solid composite samples. The composite samples
had diameter of 25-90 mm and thickness of 40-200 nm depending on the
number of layers of impregnated buckypapers used. By using large-size
aligned buckypaper and the resin infiltration method, a six-layered
magnetically aligned buckypaper/epoxy composite sample was successfully
produced. In the composite, all six-layer buckypapers were stacked along
the same alignment direction. Heavy curvature of the produced composite
sample was observed, which is also a good indication of tube alignment.
B. DMA Analysis of Aligned Buckypaper Composites
Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was conducted to explore the
mechanical properties of the resultant nanocomposites with in-plane
aligned SWNTs. The SWNT content was as high as 59.8 wt% due to the
dense packing of the aligned tubes in the composites. Fig. 5-5-8 shows the
DMA testing result of the composite sample along the tube alignment
direction. The storage modulus of the resultant nanocomposites was as
high as 40.5 GPa, which is among of the highest reported data available for
both nanotube fiber and nanocomposites. The figure also shows that the
random buckypaper composites of 31.3 wt% tube loading had a storage
modulus of 15.1 GPa, which is a 480% increase compared to the 2.6 GPa
storage modulus of the neat resin.
C. Nanostructural Characterization of the Aligned Buckypaper
Composites
The cross-section of the aligned buckypaper composites shown in Fig. 5-5-
9 reveals the nanotubes had a very good alignment, indicating that the tube
alignment in the magnetically aligned buckypaper was successfully
transferred into the bulk solid composite samples.

5.5.5 Conclusions
By in situ filtration of well-dispersed SWNT suspension inside high
magnetic fields, aligned buckypaper in which SWNTs are aligned along
the direction of the magnetic field can be fabricated. In this research, a
custom-made cylinder filter was designed to produce large magnetically
aligned buckypapers at the NHMFL. The world's largest magnetically
aligned buckypapers, with a working area of 387 cm', were successfully
manufactured and significant tube alignment was observed by SEM and
AFM analysis. The anisotropy ratios of electrical resistivity measurements
of the produced buckypapers were as high as 9.46 between the parallel and
perpendicular directions of tube alignment direction, indicating good tube
alignment. The work also showed the effects of suspension concentration
and magnetic field strength on the nanotube alignment. The results show
that significant tube alignment can be achieved in buckypapers made with
40 mg r^ suspension and a 17.3-T magnetic field. The success of producing
large magnedcally aligned buckypapers with significant tube alignment
provides the possibility for using the buckypaper/resin infiltration process
to fabricate nanocomposites with controlled tube orientation.
A special resin infiltration technique was developed to fabricate bulk
composite samples with controlled in-plane tube orientation using
magnetically aligned buckypapers. The storage modulus of the resultant
aligned composites was as high as 40.5 GPa. Good tube alignment was
also observed in the composites, demonstrating that the tube alignment in
the magnetically aligned buckypaper was successfully transferred into the

bulk solid composite samples. The research revealed that the integrated
magnetically aligned buckypapers and resin infiltration technique is an
effective method for producing nanostructures and bulk nanocomposite
materials with controlled in-plane SWNT alignment, which is critical for
developing high performance and multifunctional devices and
nanomaterials.

5.6 Magnetic Crystal Alignment of Inorganic Materials
Recently, it has been found that the crystal orientation in materials can be
controlled by the imposition of a high magnetic field. This principle can be
applied not only to magnetic materials but also to nonmagnetic materials
with asymmetric unit cells.'"^'^ When materials are placed in a magnetic
field, the crystals exhibiting anisotropic magnetic susceptibility orient
themselves to the direcdon of the maximum susceptibility parallel to the
magnetic field.
In this section, two novel processes for the crystal orientation of
ceramics and metals are described. The first novel process for ceramics, in
which a specimen is rotated during a slip casting under a high magnetic
field, has been proposed to fabricate textured ceramics with one directional
crystal orientation. As an example, the crystal orientation of Si3N4 prepared
by a-Si3N4 and a-Si3N4 with (3-Si3N4 seeds have been studied by using this
process. The second novel process for metals, in which a thin film of metal
is coated on a substrate, is remelted in a high magnetic field.

5.6.1 Crystal Texture Control by Magnetic Field Theory
When a nonmagnetic substance is magnetized in a magnetic field, the
energy for magnetization of the substance U is given by Eq. (1).
f/ = -pMd^.n (1)
Jo
where M is the magnetization, B and B.n the imposed magnetic flux density
and the magnetic flux density in the substance, respectively, /lo the
permeability in vacuum {An x 10"^ Hm~'). The principle controlling the
crystal orientation using a magnetic field works as follows: a magnetic
torque rotates crystals to take the stable crystal orientation so as to
decrease the magnetization energy.
Let us consider ceramics of the crystal structure with magnetic
anisotropy, i.e., the magnetic susceptibility is different in each crystal
direction. The value of the magnetization energy given by Eq. (2) that is
derived from Eq. (1) determines the preferred crystal direction depending
on the magnetic susceptibility of each crystal axis and the crystal shape.
U = ^ -B" (2)
where A^ is the demagnetization factor, Xc and Xa.h the c axis and aox b axis
of a magnetic susceptibility, respectively. When Xc > X^M ie., Uc < UaM the
c axis of crystals is the preferred axis parallel to the direction of the
magnetic field. In contrast, when Xc < Xo.h, i.e., Uc > UOM the a or b axis of
crystals is the preferred axis parallel to the magnetic field, that is, the c axis
of crystals aligns to all of the directions perpendicular to the imposed
magnetic field.
5.6.2 Crystal Orientation of Ceramics
A. Classification of Crystal Orientation
Silicon nitride has been identified as one of the promising structural
ceramics having high strength at high temperatures, good thermal resistance
due to the low thermal coefficient of expansion and good resistance to
oxidation. However, the low toughness remains a drawback that hampers
the potential application of Si3N4. So at present, improving the toughness
of silicon nitride is one of the important technical problems in the field of
structural ceramics. Development of ceramics having textured
microstructures is one way of effectively improving their properties.^^' ^^^
When the direction of the magnetic field is parallel or perpendicular
to the direction of slip casting, let us define the direction of magnetic field
as the Pa and P^ magnetic field, respectively. The surfaces of top, side 1 and
side 2 in a specimen are defined as shown in Fig. 5-6-1. When the Pa
magnetic field is imposed, side 1 and side 2 become the same so that they
refer to the side surface. Table 5-6-1 indicates the expected texture of
materials with different magnetic anisotropy in a slip casting under Pe and

mean diameter: 0.7 |im) was used as the original powder to make the p-
Si3N4 seeds. MgO of 4 wt% powder was used as the transformation
additive. The original powder was mixed by the use of a ball milling in
ethanol for 24 h, dried at 60°C for 6 h, then poured into a graphite crucible

and heated in a graphite furnace in nitrogen atmosphere for 1.5 h. The
heating temperature was 1650°C.'^' The sintered powder was identified
with an X-ray diffractometer (XRD).
A mixture of 88 wt% a-Si3N4, 8 wt% Y2O3 and 4 wt% AI2O3 powders
was first pretreated. It was milled in distilled water followed by drying,
sieving and calcination at 600°C for 4 h.'^' Both the pretreated powders
with and without 10 wt% p-Si3N4 seed were dispersed in distilled water
with tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) as deflocculant. At the
same time, NaOH solution was used to adjust the pH value to 11.5 to
ensure electrostatic repulsion between particles.'^^ After the suspension
with 65 wt% solids was dispersed by an ultrasonic wave for 0.5 h, it was
poured into a gypsum mold and left to consolidate under rotating of the
gypsum mold. The rotating speed was 6.25 min/tum. A Pe magnetic field
of 10 T was applied to the suspensions during the slip casting at room
temperature. Fig. 5-6-2 shows a schematic view of the experimental
apparatus with rotation. In order to examine the effect of rotation, green
samples were prepared with the magnetic field and without rotation.
Moreover, for the sake of comparison, a sample without magnetic field
was also made. After drying, the green samples were embedded in a 60
wt% Si3N4 +40 wt% BN powder bed in a graphite crucible and heated to a
temperature of 1800°C for 1.5 h in N2 atmosphere without a magnetic
field. The samples were polished then etched for surface morphology
observation using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Orientation
indices on the top and side surfaces and the relative facial angle'^^ were
calculated from X-ray diffraction patterns.
C. Results and Discussion
Figure 5-6-3 schematically shows the functions of the magnetic field and
the rotation. When the magnetic field was imposed on the suspension, the c
axis of particles can align in various directions that are perpendicular to the

magnetic field. The condition where the specimen is rotated in the
magnetic field is equivalent to the case where the specimen is fixed and the
magnetic field is rotated from the view of the relative motion. In this case,
the c axis of the particles will be perpendicular to the plane in which the
magnetic field rotates. This means that the c axis of particles aligns in the
direction parallel to the gravity direction.
Figure 5-6-4 illustrates the XRD profile and the orientation index of a
sample prepared from a-Si3N4 powder with P-Si3N4 seeds, followed by
sintering at 1800°C for 1.5 h without magnetic field. Although a difference
between the top and side surfaces of the specimen exists, it is small. The
largest orientation index is 1.62 times higher than that of the JCPDS (Joint
Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards) card, and the relative facial
angles of the top and side surfaces are 69.9° and 66.8°, respectively. When
the specimen was rotated under the magnetic field, the peaks clearly
change, as seen in Fig. 5-6-5. The (hkO) peaks are lower on the top surface
and higher on the side surface. On the other hand, (101) and (002) peaks
are higher on the top surface and lower on the side surface. The largest
orientation index is four times higher than that of the JCPDS card.
Moreover, the relative facial angles on the top and side surfaces are 47.2°
and 85.1°, respecdvely. Fig. 5-6-6 shows the SEM micrograph of the
poUshed surfaces of specimen. It also can be seen in Fig. 5-6-6(a) and (b)
that P-Si3N4 rod grains appear randomly distributed in the specimen which
was prepared without exposure to the magnetic field. In the case of the
specimens prepared with rotation under magnetic field, the highly textured

material can be obtained as shown in Fig. 5-6-6(c) and (d). In Fig. 5-6-
6(c), the top surface of the specimen is shown and the hexagonal
morphology of the p-Si3N4 is observed. On the other hand, the side surface
is shown in Fig. 5-6-6(d) and hexagonal rods are observed. Moreover, it
can be seen that the rod-like P-Si3N4 aligns in one direction, which agrees
with the theoretical consideration mentioned in section 5.6.1.
According to Table 5-6-1, the materials with j, < Xo.b cannot have
one-directional orientation. The experiment, however, showed that a high
texture microstructure can be obtained in P-Si3N4 , whose magnetic
susceptibility of the a, b axes is larger than that of the c axis, by rotating
the crucible in the magnetic field. Table 5-6-1 can be modified to Table 5-
6-2 by rotation of crucible under a magnetic field.

5.6.3 Control of Crystal Orientation in Metal Solidification
In the solidification process of metals, Mikelson et alJ^^ reported that the
macrostructure of Al-Cu and Cd-Zn alloys, which are nonmagnetic
materials, aligned in the direction of the magnetic field during solidification.
However, details on the method for evaluating the orientations of crystals
and textures are not clearly written in the report. Yasuda et al.^^^ reported that
the crystal orientation of BiMn alloy, which is a ferromagnetic material,
aligned in the direction of the magnetic field by heating the specimen
which was prepared in rapid quenching, to a liquid and solid phase in the
magnetic field. In this section, a method is proposed for aligning the
crystal orientation of nonmagnetic metals in the solidification process.
Both zinc and bismuth have a hexagonal crystal structure with
magnetic anisotropy where the magnetic susceptibility is different in each
crystal direction. The magnetic susceptibilities along the a or b axis and c
axis of zinc are Xa,b = -1.81 x lO-^(-), Xc = -1-33 x 10"V). Those of
bismuth are Xa,b = -1.24 x 10"^(-), Xc = -1.76 x lO^(-), respectively.
When crystals are set in a magnetic field, they tend to align in the preferred
crystal direction. Substituting values of the magnetic susceptibility of zinc
and bismuth into Eq. (2), we obtain Uc < Ua,h in the case of zinc and Ua,h < Uc
in the case of bismuth. These results indicate that the c axis of zinc crystal
and the a or b axis of bismuth are the preferred direction parallel to the
direction of the magnetic field.
When a crystal is precipitated in a melt, the magnetization M arises in
it due to the imposed magnetic field and the torque caused by the crystal
magnetic anisotropy works on the crystal. The equation expressing rotation
motion of the crystal is given by Eq. (3).
S7tr]r' — + — Jcr'aB' ^ + ^ r'Ax^' sin 20 = 0 (3)
dr 15 dt 3jUo
(Viscous force) (Lorentz force) (Magnetization force)
The solution to Eq. (3) is given by
tan^ = tan^oexp — r = — —Uo (V
V rJ 5AxB^
where ^o is the angle between the magnetic field imposed and the easy
magnetization axis at r = 0.
From the calculation of Eq. (4) using typical data of ceramic particles
in a slip casting, it is understood that the particle finishes its rotation within
one second when a magnetic field of more than 1 T is imposed. The
rotation time decreases with increasing magnetic flux density and decreasing
particle radius. The rotation time does not depend on the particles with
radius of less than 10 jum when ^ = 1 T. This result can be interpreted from
Eq. (3) as follows. The Lorentz force term is a function of five powers of

the radius, and both the viscous force and the magnetization force terms
are a function of three powers of the radius. Thus, the Lorentz force term
becomes predominant and the rotation time depends substantially on the
radius when the particle radius is large, but the Lorentz force is negligible
when the particle radius becomes small.
A water-cooling pipe was inserted into the bore of a superconducting
magnet and an alumina crucible with a heater set inside the pipe. A zinc
film (10 X 28 mm^) prepared by dipping a steel plate in a molten zinc bath
was set on a stainless steel pipe, which was inserted from the upper part of
the magnet bore. The sample plane was set at the position with the
maximum magnetic flux density in the direction parallel or perpendicular
to the magnetic field. A thermocouple was inserted though the stainless
steel pipe. The temperature of the sample was measured by the
thermocouple, which is connected to the surface of the sample. The
crucible was filled with argon gas to prevent oxidation of the sample and
the temperature was kept in the liquid and solid phase of zinc for three
minutes. Then the furnace was cooled by shutting off the heat.
The diffraction pattern of X-rays on the samples to which the
magnetic field was imposed perpendicular and parallel is shown in Fig. 5-
6-7(a) and (b), respectively. In Fig. 5-6-7(a), the peak (101) plane was
detected to be stronger in the sample obtained under no magnetic field. On
the other hand, when a magnetic field of 12 T was imposed, the peak (101)
decreased and the peak (002) equivalent to the c plane appeared stronger.
The diffraction pattern of X-rays of the sample, to which the magnetic
field was imposed in parallel, is shown in Fig. 5-6-7(b). The peak (101)
was detected to be stronger in the sample obtained under no magnetic field
as well as the previous result shown in Fig. 5-6-7(a). However, when a
magnetic field of 12 T was imposed, the peak (101) decreased and the peak
(100) equivalent to the a,b plane appeared stronger. That is, regardless of

direction estimated on the basis of the magnetization energy mentioned
above.
Next, the bulk metal of Bi-5 mass% Sn alloy, which is a eutectic
alloy, was used as the specimen. The specimen was heated to 300°C in an
argon atmosphere at a rate of 300°C h"^ maintained there for 30 minutes,
then cooled to 255°C at a rate of 180X hr\ stirred at 255°C for three
minutes then cooled to room temperature in a furnace set in the bore of a
superconducting magnet. The specimen was cut perpendicular to the
direction of the magnetic field and its surface was polished to examine the
crystal structure by XRD. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the Bi-Sn alloy
are given in Fig. 5-6-8. Only the peak of (OOn) lines appeared in the case of
0 T, but the peaks of the a,b planes {hkO) and (012) increased in the case of
12 T. This result agrees with the theoretical estimation.

5.7 Minimum Field Intensity Required to Achieve Magnetic
Alignment of Diamagnetic and Paramagnetic Particles
5.7.1 Parameters That Control Magnetic Alignment of Micron-size
Particles
Quantitative analysis on the magnetic orientation observed for small
particles due to the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility l^x ^^e not
popularly done at present. The number of materials which showed
alignment is not very large. It is generally accepted that a magnetically
stable axis of a micron-sized particle dispersed in a fluid medium aligns
almost parallel to a magnetic field B when the field-induced anisotropy
energy {\l2)M^x^^ is much larger than the energy of rotational Brownian
motion (1/2)A:B7' at temperature 7; here ^x ^^^ M denote magnetic
anisotropy per unit mass and the weight of the particle, respectively.^^ This
means that the minimum field intensity required to achieve orientation can
be predicted when the A;^ and M value of the material is known. Accordingly,
alignments of micron-sized particles are expected to occur below 2 Tesla at
room temperature for various diamagnetic materials, since published
values of their diamagnetic anisotropy (A;^)DIA usually exceed 10"^ emu
g-..2,
The ^x value of a material which contains no spontaneous magnetization
is described as the summation of an intrinsic (A;f)DiA of the material and a
paramagnetic anisotropy (A;f)pARA deriving from the paramagnetic ions
included in the material. Orientation of organic materials due to (A;f)DiA are
reported in a strong field intensity above several Tesla in many cases,
while orientation due to paramagnetic anisotropy (A/)PARA is achieved at
relatively low field intensities.'^ Quantitative relationships between degree
of orientation and field intensity were studied only on limited kinds of

--- Page 258 ---

5.7 Minimum Field Intensity Required to Achieve Magnetic Alignment 241
materials as mentioned before, such as on liquid crystal molecules,'^ fibrin
fibers,^^ blood cells,"^^ mica and clay minerals,^ ^^ agarose^^ and lythozyme
crystals.^' ^^ Magnetic orientation was not often performed on inorganic
materials compared to organic materials previously. Relationships between
degree of orientation and field intensity of inorganic materials were
measured for the first time on various kinds of mica and clay minerals^ ^^
as well as on graphite'^^ to examine the effects of the above parameters on
the alignment process. It was difficult to alter the magnitude of the three
parameters over a wide range in measurements of organic materials.
The results of magnetic alignment measured for ten inorganic
materials are compiled in Fig. 5-7-1. Liquid ethanol is used as a dispersing
medium. Degree of alignment is described by an order parameter <m> =
<(3cos^0 -l)/2> which is a Boltzmann average at temperature r^^; 6
denotes the angle between the magnetically stable axis of a particle and the
field direction, as shown in Fig. 5-7-1(a). The completely random state and
the completely ordered state of the particles are described by <m> = 0 and
1, respectively. Boltzmann average was calculated by the free energy of a
particle described as [/ = -(MB^/2){xi -i- Axcos^O], which is a formula first
introduced by Langevin and Curie''^; Ax was defined as Ax = X// ~ X^^
where X// and Xi were the magnetic susceptibilities per unit mass parallel
and perpendicular to the stable axis, respectively.
The degree of orientation <m> increases gradually with increasing
field intensity; complete alignment is achieved only at infinite field
intensity. A field of full alignment Bs was therefore introduced tentatively,
which was used as an indicator to compare the field intensity required to
achieve alignment under different conditions of M, Ax and T.^ ^' ^^^ Bs was
defined as the field intensity where <m> was equal to <m> = 0.78 which is
calculated as
Bs = i\5kBT/MAxy" (1)
This equation shows explicitly that the field intensity to achieve
aUgnment can be reduced by increasing M or A;^,^ ^^ and also by decreasing
T.^^^ The posidon of Bs is illustrated in Fig. 5-7-1(b). The Bs value is
predicted from observed M and published (A;^)DIA values based on
anisotropy measurements of bulk samples before a <m>-B measurement;
M is determined from the images of the particles obtained by scanning
electron microscope and density of the materials. The calculated ^s
values were fairly consistent with the Bs values obtained from <m>-B
measurement (see Table 1 of refs. 2, 14, 15 and 17), which confirmed that
the alignment process proceeded by the mechanism assumed by Langevin
and Curie. "'^'^"-^'^
The effects of the three parameters are discussed below in detail.

5.7.2 Effect of Diamagnetic Anisotropy (A;^ )DIA on Magnetic
Alignment
The alteration of A;^ is most effective in reducing ^s among the three
parameters. Fig. 5-7-l(b)(c)(d) shows the <m>-B relationships of pure
diamagnetic materials measured at 300 K, namely for A1(0H)3, KDP,
corundum, orthoclase, gypsum and graphite.*^^ The (A;^)DIA values of these
materials, which are obtained from anisotropy measurements on bulk
single crystals discussed in section 7.4, range from 10"^ to 10"^ emu g ^ Bs
are hence expected to vary from 10"^ to 10^ T at room temperarture for

5.7 Minimum Field Intensity Required to Achieve Magnetic Alignment 243
micron-size single crystals according to Eq. (1); this assumption is
confirmed experimentally in the figures.
Bs values of small single crystals at room temperature (300 K) were
calculated for popular materials in biochemistry, mineralogy and petrology
as well as in organic and inorganic synthesis. The values were calculated
for sphere-shaped crystals with a diameter of 0.5 |im using published
(A;f)DiA values.'^' '^' ^^^ The calculated values listed in Table 5-7-1 show that
ahgnment can be achieved at field intensity below 2.5 Tesla, without the
use of a superconducting magnet for many of the materials.^^
Magnetic alignment was not studied intensively on inorganic
microcrystals previously compared to organic particles as mentioned
before, partly because the number of published (A;f)DiA values was limited.
The origin of (A;f)DiA of inorganic oxides was assigned to the individual
bonding orbital composing the crystal as described in section 7.4.^^' ^^^
(A;f)DIA values were obtained for a single bond of a hydrogen bond, for a T-
O bond of a [T0]4 tetrahedral unit as well as for a M-0 bond of a [M0]6
octahedral unit, as shown in Fig. 7-4-2; these bonds are the major types of
chemical bonds that compose inorganic oxides. Many of the (A;f)DiA values
of oxides are expected to exceed lO'^^emu g~^ according to the model;
almost all the inorganic oxide particles are hence expected to cause
alignment at field intensity below several Tesla.

5.7.3 Effect of Paramagnetic Anisotropy (Ax )PARA on Magnetic
Alignment
Magnetic alignments were achieved at low field intensity when
concentrations of paramagnetic ions were high (see Fig. 5-7-l(e)(f))-'^^ Bs
value observed for biotite microcrystals having paramagnetic susceptibility
of ;t:PARA = 4.4 X 10-^emu g' was ^s = 0.021 T. ^s was 0.060 T for
muscovite microcrystals with ;fPARA = 4.8 x 10"^emu g"'. Alignments have
not been reported at such low fields for nonferromagnetic oxide particles.
Bs of synthetic phlogopite free of paramagnetic ions was measured to be
3.6 T.^^ The crystal structures of biotite and phlogopite are nearly equivalent
and considered to possess similar (A;^)DIA values according to a model
described in Fig. 7-4-2'^ ^^^; the small ^s value of biotite is hence attributed
to (A;f)pARA. Indeed the measured ^s value of biotite was consistent with the
calculated Bs value based on Ax obtained from bulk crystal measurements;
the observed Ax-T relationships on bulk crystals showed explicitly that
(A;if)pARA of biotite was considerably larger than (A;|f)DiA (see Fig. 2 of ref.
14). The paramagnetic origin of magnetic alignment was examined
simultaneously for grains of muscovite,'^* kaolinite and talc'^^ as well. The
Ax-T measurements were extended on a number of bulk materials;
examples of such measurements on AlOOH are shown in Fig. 7-4-1(b). Ax
values generally showed Curie temperature dependences for most of the
measured oxides such as talc, brucite, orthoclase, petalite, scapolite and
kaolinite (see Fig. 2. of refs. 14, 19 and 20). Hence the effect of (A;f)pARA in
reducing Bs as observed in Fig. 5-7-l(e)(f) is likely to occur for inorganic
oxides in general.
5.7.4 Effect of Weight M of the Particle on Magnetic Alignment
^s is reduced by increasing M according to Eq. (1); the effect was
introduced in the course of analyzing the polymerization process of fibrin
fibers under an external field."^^ The M dependence was discussed in the
process of crystal growth of lysozyme.^^ Bs-M relationship was directly
observed on the magnetic alignment by measuring mica and clay grains^'^^;
the reduction rate of Bs due to enhancement of M did not exceed 10%,
which was mainly due to the limitation of the maximum size of the particle
that can be maintained in the dispersed fluid medium under terrestrial
gravity.^'^^
5.7.5 Effect of Temperature T on Magnetic Alignment
Results of measured T-Bs relationship of diamagnetic graphite grains
measured in He gas medium are shown in Fig. 5-7-2; r'^^ dependence
deduced from Eq. (1) is confirmed from the measurements. The effect of
the Brownian thermal rotation on magnetic orientation assumed by
Langevin and Curie was confirmed directly by measuring the Bs-T

T-Bs relationships were measured for micron-size crystals including
paramagnetic ions, i.e., talc and kaolinite^^^; talc and kaolinite are classic
ceramic materials. Reduction rate of the ^s of these materials due to
decrease of T is much larger than the T^^^ dependence observed for the
diamagnetic graphite grains, indicating the contribution of the paramagnetic
ions. It is deduced from Eq. (1) that ^s becomes proportional to T with a
decrease in temperature, since (A;f)pARA is proportional to T~^ following
Curie's law; (A;f)DiA becomes negligible compared to (A;|f)pARA with the
reduction of temperature.'^^
The Ax-T relationships on bulk samples of biotite and talc mentioned
above'^^ indicate that Bs becomes smaller than 1 mT below r = 10 K for
these materials, as shown in Fig. 5-7-2; partial alignment by terrestrial field
may be detected at this condition. Magnetic alignment of microcrystals
floated in He gas was achieved by developing a new apparatus for

measuring the Bs-T relationship in the low temperature region.'^' ^^^
Measurements are allowed only above T = 160 K when liquid ethanol is
used as the dispersing medium. He gas is a unique medium that can
disperse micron-size particles and remain fluid below T= 100 K. Magnetic
orientation of graphite grains mentioned above has been achieved recently
between 7 = 80 K and room temperature using this system, as shown in the
figure. Measurements below T= 100 K are in preparation for paramagnetic
particles to examine the low ^s values expected from Fig. 5-7-2.
5.7.6 Conclusions
1. Preferential orientation of magnetically stable axes observed for
micron-size particles dispersed in fluid medium are expected at field
intensity below 2 T for most diamagnetic materials. The result is
deduced by assuming a balance between the Brownian motion energy
supplied from the fluid molecules and the field-induced anisotropy
energy of the particle, following the assumption proposed by Langevin
and Curie.
2. Field intensity where an order parameter <m> = <3cos^^ - 1> reached
<m> = 0.78 was defined as the field of orientation ^s; 0 is the angle
between the stable axis and the field, ^s is calculated as Bs =
(15 kBT/MAxY'^. It is important to define an indicator such as ^s in
order to investigate the origin of magnetic alignment quantitatively.
3. Experiments confirmed that Bs at room temperature varied from 10"^ to
10^ T as Ax increased from 10"^ to 10"^ emu g"' for spherical single
crystals having a diameter of 0.5 |im and volume density of 2.0 g cm~^;
most of the published (A;f)DiA values range in the above-mentioned
area. The possibility of application and utilization of magnetic effects
due to magnetic anisotropy may increase considerably when the effects
are achieved at practical low field intensities and when the range of
selecting magnetically active materials is broadened to include
diamagnetic materials in general.
4. Enhancement of concentrations of paramagnetic ions was effective in
reducing Bs since the paramagnetic anisotropy increases the effective
Ax value considerably. A biotite microcrystal, which had paramagnetic
susceptibility of 4.4 x 10"*^ emu g~\ had a small Bs value of 0.021 T.
Alignments had not been reported at such low fields for
nonferromagnetic oxide particles previously. Practical efficiency of
magnetic alignment can be enhanced considerably by doping a finite
amount of paramagnetic ions in the course of material processing.
5. Bs was proportional to 7'^' for diamagnetic crystals free of
paramagnetic ions, while ^s was proportional to T for particles
including paramagnetic ions since Ax was proportional to T following
the Curie law. The effect is expected to occur for many of the
nonmagnetic materials since their Ax-T relationship on bulk crystals

follow the Curie law. ^s is expected to become smaller than 1 mT
below r= 100 K for the micron-size particles of biotite mentioned in 3.
The particles are dispersed in a He gas medium in order to realize
alignment at low temperatures.

Dynamic Spin Chemistry
The field of dynamic spin chemistry, founded in the 1970s, is
the most established area in magneto-science. In dynamic spin
chemistry, a magnetic field affects the transitions of electron
spin states of a short-lived reaction intermediate, called a radical
pair, resulting in intermediate lifetime and product yield
changes. The magnetic phenomena are interpreted semi-
quantitatively or quantitatively in terms of quantum chemistry.
The silent feature of spin chemistry is that magnetic fields
ranging from a very weak field of ca. 0.0001 T to a very high
field of ca. 30 T significantly affect chemical processes in
different ways.
In this chapter, MFEs on photochemical reactions, photo-
electrochemical reactions and spin-dependent processes in
crystals and related phenomena are described.
6.1 Magnetic Field Effects in Photochemical Reactions
Magnetic field effects (MFEs) have attracted much attention from many
scientists since studies of MFEs on chemical reactions began in the
1970s.^^ The effects have been explained in terms of the radical pair (RP)
mechanism by which the spin dynamics of a short-lived radical
intermediate is affected by an external magnetic field. Most of the studies
have been carried out in relatively low magnetic fields (< ca. 1 T).
Recently, however, using a newly developed technique easily generating
high magnetic fields, many interesting MFEs at room temperature have
been observed in a high magnetic field range of up to 30 T.^ ^^ As a result, a
new phenomenon of reversal of MFE has been observed and interpreted by
the spin-lattice relaxation mechanism. Since the studies carried out in low
magnetic fields have previously been described in the literature, ^^ several
investigations of a new effect observed in high magnetic fields (1-14 T) on
the primary photochemical process in solution, which have recently been
conducted by the author's group, is mainly introduced in this chapter.

6.1.1 Theory
A theory very often utilized for explaining MFEs on photochemical
reactions'^^ is called the RP mechanism. The MFE in the RP mechanism is
usually explained by interplay between two electron spins of radical
intermediates generated by photochemical reactions and an external
magnetic field. After the generation, the RP populates on two electron spin
states of singlet (S) and triplet (T), where the latter splits into three
sublevels, T+, To and T_, in the presence of a magnetic field (Fig. 6-1-1).
The initial population between them depends on the reaction and reactional
condition. Once it is generated, the RP participates in the S-T spin
interconversion followed by deactivating toward the starting material and
final products. In such a RP deactivation scheme, the S-T spin
interconversion depends on the external magnetic field, resulting in the
appearance of an MFE on the radical deactivation rate and/or product yield
in photochemical reactions. This is a simple explanation of the RP
mechanism.
As shown in Fig. 6-1-1, however, the energy gap, 27, between the S
and T states arising from the exchange interaction between the two
electron spins influences the S-T spin interconversion. Whereas the RP
cannot undergo the S-T spin interconversion because of the large 27
immediately after generation, it can undergo the interconversion due to 27
~ 0 after the diffusion of two spins. Therefore, significant MFEs are

observed when 27-0 where the two spins retain sufficient inter-radical
distance. In the 27-0 condition, the S-T spin interconversion is governed
by the magnetic field-dependent submechanisms of isotropic hyperfine
coupling (HFC), S-T_ level crossing, isotropic A^, and relaxation
mechanisms.'^^ In the HFC mechanism MFE is based on inhibition of the
HFC-determined intersystem crossing (ISC) between S and T states by the
Zeeman splitting of the T sublevels. In the S-T_ level crossing mechanism
the MFE appears by acceleration of the so far ineffective S-T spin
interconversion due to completely non-zero 27 by S and T_ energy level
matching upon the Zeeman splitting. In the isotropic Ag mechanism MFE
is caused by the enhanced S-To ISC resulting from the magnetic field-
accelerated dephasing of the two electron spins in the precessing vector
model.
6.1.2 Relaxation Mechanism
In high magnetic fields beyond about 100 mT, spin-lattice relaxation
(SLR) of the RP becomes important as a RP deactivation process.'"*^ In the
case of RPs made of light elements of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, etc.,
three magnetic field-dependent interactions, namely, anisotropic hyperfine
(6hf) interaction, anisotropic Zeeman (5g) interaction, and electron dipole-
dipole (dd) interaction, are generally associated with SLR. Each of these
interactions affects the RP deactivation with increasing magnetic field,
causing MFEs. The two former interactions are operative independently at
each independent radical, whereas the latter functions between the two
electrons on the component radicals. Based on the selection rule, both 5hf
and 6g interactions induce all four SLR processes of T+-To, T_-To, T+-S,
and T--S, whereas the dd interaction only induces the two SLR processes
of T+-To and T--To. Therefore, under the assumption that To-S ISC is fast
when 27 ~ 0, the RP decay rate constant (ICR?) (a reciprocal of the RP
lifetime TRP) is generally expressed as a combination of the rate constant
(/:(SLR)) due to this relaxation mechanism and the rate constant for other
magnetic field-independent processes as
fep=l/TRP=i^(SLR) + ^T=(l/2)i{)t,(6hf) + A:/(8g)} + ^(dd) + /:T (0
Here, ki{5hf) and A:,(6g) denote SLR rate constants due to the 5hf and 5g
interactions operating on each radical /, respectively, ^(dd) the SLR rate
constant due to the dd interaction operating between radicals 1 and 2, and
kj the rate constant of magnetic field-independent deactivation processes
such as the escape process from a micellar cage.

/:(dd) = /'//dd'Tdd / (1 + CO'TM' ) (4)
where y denotes the magnetogyric ratio of an electron, (g': g') an
anisotropic g-tensor of a radical, and H\oc and Hdd locally fluctuating
magnetic fields yielded by the 5hf and dd interactions, respectively. TC, and
CO represent the rotational correlation time for the tumbling Brownian
motion of a radical and the Larmor frequency, respectively.
As for the 5hf interaction, H\oc includes an anisotropic hyperfine
tensor and thereby depends on the kind and number of related nuclear
spins. This is the origin of magnetic isotope effects (MIEs) frequently
observed in high magnetic fields. Further, since co = yB, ki(Shf) decreases
upon an increase in B. Hence, the RP controlled by this interaction
increases its lifetime as B increases. In general, this phenomenon is known
to appear when ^ = 0.1 -2 T.
As for the 5g interaction, the effect depends on the term (g' : g')
whose origin is the spin-orbit-coupling (SOC) interaction of an unpaired
electron on a radical. It is theoretically suggested that the effect is larger
when an electron is present on a heavier atom, e.g., carbon < nitrogen <
oxygen. Contrary to the 5hf interaction, the RP governed by this
interaction decreases its lifetime as B increases, since there are B terms not
only in the denominator (co = yB) but also in the numerator on the right-
hand side of Eq. (3). It has been found that the lifetime decrease tends to
appear in magnetic fields higher than about 2 T where this interaction
replaces the 5hf and dd interactions in determining the RP lifetime.
Lastly, as for the dd interaction, Hdd can be rewritten using an inter-
radical distance R as
//dd' =(3/10)((2;r)--/2'Y' <^"' >) (5)
where <R~^> is the mean value of R'^. This relation indicates that the dd
interaction is dependent on R and plays an important role in SLR,
especially in the case of a small R. Like the 5hf interaction, the RP
dominated by this interaction increases its lifetime as B increases. This
interaction is effective up to ca. 2 T. The distinction between the dd and
6hf interactions is usually difficult, judging from the experimental point of
view. Only magnetic isotope substitution makes it possible since there is
no MIE in the dd interaction.
6.1.3 MFEs Controlled by the RP Mechanism
A. MFEs of Chain-linked Biradicals in Homogeneous Solution
a. Triplet BRs
MFEs on photochemical reactions have been studied widely in
homogenous and micellar solutions. However, a biradical (BR) where two
radicals are linked by flexible chemical bonds is often used since the
linkage causes a large MFE by suppressing dissociation of the radicals.

--- Page 269 ---

6.1 Magnetic Field Effects in Photochemical Reactions 253
An interesting example among MFEs on the distribution of reaction
products is presented here. Usually, MFEs are studied by monitoring the
effect on reaction quantum yield and/or a lifetime (a rate constant) in
which the former has a practical aspect of application of the MFEs to
syntheses. In a photo-redox reaction in methylene-chain-linked molecules
(4-02N-CioH6-0-(CH2).-NHC6H5, AT = 8-12) containing nitronaphthoxy and
anilino groups/' ^^ the yield of escape product via triplet BR (^BR) of n = 8
increases from 39% to 63% in the presence of 0.64 T, whereas that of cage
product via singlet BR ('BR) decreases from 61% to 37%, indicating a
dominant reaction pathway switched by an external magnetic field. When
n ^ 10, the yield of cage product predominates in the presence and
absence of the field,
i) Reversal of MFEs
As for MFEs on BR lifetimes, many "^BRs have been investigated in
homogenous solutions.' "^^ About ten years ago, a high magnetic field
beyond 10 T drew attention for exploring new MFEs. In ''BR of the
anthrasemiquinone radical (AQH-)-C02-(CH2)i2-OCO-xanthenyl radical
(X-) generated by photo-induced hydrogen abstraction of anthraquinone
(AQ) from xanthene (X) in AQ-C02-(CH2)i2-OCO-X,'^ the BR lifetime
increases steeply from 0.2 jis at 0 T to a maximum lifetime of 4.0 |LIS at 2 T,
then decreases gradually to a lifetime of 3.2 |LIS at the highest magnetic
field of 14 T. This new MFE, a reversal of MFE, occurs at ca. 2 T. This is
the first observation of a reversal of MFE in a high magnetic field. The
MFE up to ca. 2 T can be explained by the HFC mechanism and the 5hf-
and dd-induced relaxation mechanisms, while the MFE observed above
2 T can be explained in terms of the 5g-induced relaxation mechanism
which accelerates the SLR among spin sublevels by applying a magnetic
field of a few tesla. From the analysis based on the 6g mechanism, the
correlation time has been estimated to be a few picoseconds.
In order to clarify the mechanism of the reversal of MFE, other BRs
showing a large decrease in lifetime have been sought. ^BR of the
phenothiazine radical cation (Ph-^)-(CH2),rviologen radical cation (V-^)
generated by photo-induced electron transfer from Ph to V^^ in a rotaxane-
type a-cyclodextrin inclusion complex of Ph-CCH:)^ -V^^ has exhibited the
most significant reversal of MFE.^^^ Fig. 6-1-2 shows the magnetic field
dependence (MFD) of the BR lifetime. The lifetimes of n= 12 are 0.14 |LIS
(0 T), 6.6 lis (1 T), and 2.2 |is (13 T). The lifetime at 13 T is 33% of that at
1 T. As a result of simulation with Eq. (1) using parameters available so
far, it has been found that the magnitude of both the anisotropic g-value,
(g' : g'), and the correlation time TC is important for reproducing the
reversal. The observed MFD of the lifetime has been well reproduced
when (/ : g') = 10"^ and TC = 1 ps. This short correlation time of 1 ps or so
is the key parameter for reproducing the reversal of MFE as well as the
case of AQH-C02-(CH2)i2-OCO-X-. On the other hand, the carbazole

radical cation (Cz-'')-(CH2)i2-V-^ does not exhibit such a large reversal,
directly indicating that the moiety of phenothiazine of Ph-^-(CH2);,-V-''
plays an important role in the extent of reversal. Very recently, the
contribution of the 5g interactions due to Ph-^ in Ph-^-(CH2).-V-^ and V-"" in
Cz-^-(CH2)i2-V-'' has been verified with calculated anisotropic g- and hf-
tensors by the ab initio molecular calculation program Gaussian03W.^^ The
origin of the short correlation time is not very clear at present. However, a
very similar reversal of MFE has been observed not only in "^BRs in
homogenous fluid solution but also in many ^RPs in micellar solution. The
micro-environment surrounding BRs in homogenous fluid solution should
be very different from that surrounding RPs in micelles. Therefore, it
seems most reasonable to consider local motion such as torsion around a
C-N bond linking an alkane to phenothiazine as the origin of the short
correlation time. Chain length (AI = 8, 10 and 12) dependence is also
observed in Fig. 6-1-2. As the length decreases, the lifetimes in the absence
and presence of the magnetic field increase and decrease, respectively.^^
The increase is interpreted in terms of deceleration of ISC caused by the
exchange interaction of 27 of BR in close proximity. The decrease is
explained by enhancement in both the SOC-induced recombination to Ph-
n-W^^ and the dd-induced interaction in SLR. Similar chain length

dependence has been observed in the xanthone ketyl radical (X0H-)-C02-
(CH2)„-OCO-X-'' '^ and benzophenone ketyl radical (BPH-)-0-(CH2).-0-
diphenylaminyl radical (DPA-).'^^ In XOH-C02-(CH2)„-OCO-X- (n = 3, 5,
6, 8, 12 and 16), moreover, chain length dependence in the high magnetic
field above ca. 2 T has been observed. The BR lifetimes remain constant
and short regardless of the field in shorter chains of ^z = 3 and 5, whereas in
longer chains of n = 6, 8 12 and 16 the lifetimes are longer than in the short
chains, and show an apparent decrease with increasing magnetic field. This
difference has been explained by the degree of contributions of the SOC-
induced recombination and the 8g-induced SLR. In the shorter chain the
thereby enlarged SOC-induced recombination, which is magnetic field-
independent, is superior to that of the 5g-induced SLR, while the 5g-
induced SLR operates effectively in place of SOC weakened due to the
long distance between the component radicals. The chain length
dependence has also been measured in BPH-0-(CH2);,-0- DPA- (n = 2, 4, 8
and 16). In n = 4, 8 and 16 the BR lifetime in each chain commonly shows
a steep increase due to both the HFC and 6hf-and dd-induced SLR
mechanisms followed by a gentle decrease due to the 5g-induced SLR
mechanism. However, the lifetime in the shortest chain of n = 2 shows a
decrease with a shallow dip at around 2 T. This dip has been attributed to
the S-T_ level crossing.
Furthermore, recently, an MFE based on a new mechanism has been
measured in photo-induced intramolecular electron transfer reaction from
zinc tetraphenylporphyrin (ZnP) to viologen in ZnP-0-(CH2)n-V^^ (n = 4, 6
and 8).^^ By reducing the chain length connecting the component radicals,
the BR lifetime lengthens owing to the appearance of 27, as noted above,
keeping a single component. In the shortest chain BR of ZnP-^-0-(CH2)4-
V-^, however, the lifetime apparently consists of two components above
about 5 T, the shorter lifetime of which is dependent on the magnetic field
(310 ns at 7.6 T decreased to 140 ns at 13 T.) whereas the longer one is
independent of it. These intriguing MFEs for the two lifetimes have been
explained in terms of the 5g interaction in both SLR and the spin-spin
relaxation in the high magnetic field. That is, the MFEs have been
interpreted by the SLR mechanism adding MFD of the 8g-induced spin-
spin relaxation in the To-S transition decelerated as a result of the
appreciable To-S energetic separation due to the exchange interaction in the
short chain of n = 4. This is the first interpretation for this unique MFE.
ii) Magnetic isotope effects in high magnetic fields
Magnetic isotope effects (MIEs) on the BR lifetime in the high magnetic
field have been examined in detail through investigations of BRs generated
from benzophenone (BP)-0-(CH2).-0-benzhydrol (BH), BP-C02-(CH2)i2-
0-diphenylmethane (DPM), BP-C02-(CH2)i2-0-phenylethanol (PE), and

BP-0-(CH2).-0-BH is composed of two equivalent BPH-. This BR is
suitable for analysis of MIEs since the theoretical analysis of the lifetimes
becomes simple by reducing the number of parameters. Fig. 6-1-3 shows
the MFD of the BR lifetimes of isotope-substituted BPH.-0-(CH2)i2-0-
BPH- in benzene.^^ The MIEs are observed in BPH- with '^C-substitution at
a benzylic carbon below 4 T, whereas no MIEs are present above 4 T or at
0 T. The lifetimes of the BR whose hydrogen at phenyl rings are
substituted by ^H exhibit MFD very similar to that for '^C-BPH-O-
(CH2)i2-0-BPH.-'^C. It is notable that the MIEs are observed in much
higher fields compared to RPs in micellar solution (< 2 T).
The MIEs in 0.1-4 T can be explained by the 6hf-induced relaxation
mechanism, where the SLR rates among spin sublevels are influenced by
the anisotropic HFC interaction. It should be noted that this mechanism is
different from the conventional MIE in which S-T ISC in BR is influenced
by the isotropic HFC. Analogous MIEs are obtained for BRs generated
from BP-C02-(CH2)i2-0-DPM and BP-C02-(CH2)i2-0-PE.' '^ The most
remarkable effect of 70-80% is observed in 0.2-0.7 T between the
lifetimes of ''C-BPH.-C02-(CH2)i2-0-DPM.-''C and ^^C-BPH.-C02-
(CH2)i2-0-DPM.-'^C. Furthermore, by applying Eqs. (l)-(5) to the MIE
data, contributions of the 6hf and dd interactions can be evaluated
separately. As a result, the values of//ioc('^C)^-//ioc('^C)% TC, Hdd' and Tdd for
BPH.-0-(CH2)i2-0-BPH- have been obtained to be 0.69 mT^ 8.1 ps,
4.7 mT, and 25 ps, respectively. The correlation time for the 5hf interaction

6.1 Magnetic Field Effects in Photochemical Reactions 257
of BPH- is about 8.1 ps whereas that for the dd interaction is 25 ps, from
which the radical-radical distance is estimated to be about 1.3 nm. These
are reasonable from the consideration of their molecular sizes. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first time that two correlation times have been
obtained separately from the MFD of the BR lifetimes. The values for
diphenylmethyl radical (DPM-) and hydroxyphenylmethyl radical (PE-)
have also been obtained to be 10 and 12 ps, respectively.^^ The TC for BPH%
DPM-, and PE- is around 10 ps, whereas that for XOH- is 20 ps.^^ The TC
value increases with molecular size, in accordance with the expectation
from the conventional Stokes-Einstein-Debye equation of TC =
{AI?>)Kphl{kT) where r is the radius of a molecule,
b. Singlet BRs
Systematic studies have been carried out on phenanthrene (Phen) and A^,A^-
dimethylaniline (DMA) chain-linked compounds.'^^ Upon excitation of
Phen, an electron transfer from DMA to Phen occurs to form singlet ionic
BR (*IBR), which is equilibrated with fluorescent singlet exciplex.
Magnetic fields operate on the spin interconversion from 'IBR to the triplet
IBR (^IBR) to affect the fluorescence intensity and lifetimes of the
exciplex. Also, the solvent polarity influences the magnitude of MFE by
changing the mutual stability of ^IBR and exciplex in the solvent polarity.
The equilibrium between them shifts to 'IBR in polar solvent, resulting in
significant MFE.
Figure 6-1-4 shows the MFD of the exciplex fluorescence intensity
ratio /B//O in the Phen-(CH2)n-0-(CH2)2-DMA system in DMF, where h and
/o are the fluorescence intensities in the presence and absence of magnetic
field B, respectively.*^ *'^ For short-chain molecules small dips are
observed in very low fields. A dramatic increase in the ratio occurs in low
fields (~ 0.2 T) then decreases gradually (up to 9 T). The fluorescence
mean lifetimes exhibit analogous MFD.
While the MFE in which the fluorescence intensity and lifetime
increase in low fields is attributable to the isotropic HFC mechanism, the
dips are attributed to the S-T_ level crossing. From the magnetic fields of
dips, the S-To energy gaps (|2y|) are obtained to be a large value of 180 mT
at short length n = 4 and a small one of 7.7 mT at long length /i = 8, as
expected.
The exciplex fluorescence intensities of Phen-(CH2)n-0-(CH2)2-DMA
decrease at higher fields (> 1 T), as shown in Fig. 6-1-4(b). In the case of
^BRs the effect of higher magnetic field above ca. 2 T is chiefly described
by relaxation due to the 6g mechanism. However, in this case of ^IBRs the
effect is interpreted in terms of the Ag mechanism, since the SLR is too
slow to compete with other decay processes from the singlet state.'^^
Applying a simplified model to this BR kinetics involving the fast
equilibrium between the exciplex and *IBR, the Ag value has been obtained
from fast and slow lifetimes to be 0.000018 ± 0.000004 (n = 10) and

B. MFEs of RPs in Micellar Solution
Since the interior of a micelle is usually hydrophobic, nonpolar or less
polar organic molecules solubilized in the micelle do not escape quickly
from the micellar interior to the polar water phase. Therefore, micelles are
popularly used to extend lifetimes of RPs, although the chemical and
physical properties of micelles of micellar size, shape, aggregation number
and location of solutes inside a micelle are highly complex. Since MFE on
the primary photochemical process of BP in micellar solution was reported
by Sakaguchi and his collaborators in 1980,''^ many photochemical
reactions of aromatic carbonyls have been reported in micellar solution to
discuss the kinetics and dynamics of the reactions and the mechanisms of
MFEs.^'^^
a. Influence of micelles and chain length of solutes on MFEs
For instance, in photo-induced hydrogen abstraction of the excited triplet
AQ in micellar solution, the influence of micelles on MFEs has been

elucidated in the high magnetic field of up to 14 T.^ ^^^ Fig. 6-1-5 shows
MFDs of the lifetimes of ^RPs comprising AQH- and a counter radical (R-)
generated on each surfactant: SDS, HDTCl and Brij35. The lifetime in all
solutions more or less increases up to 2-3 T, then decreases in the higher
field. The increase in RP lifetimes in the low fields is attributable to the
depletion of RP T-S transitions due to SLR (the 5hf- and/or dd-induced
SLR mechanisms), while the decrease in RP lifetimes above 2-3 T is
ascribed to the relaxation due to the ^-anisotropy (the 6g-induced SLR
mechanism). The order of the increments in RP decay rate constants above
2-3 T is SDS < HDTCl < Brij35. This largest increment in Brij35 is
understandable because the radical is generated on a carbon in the
repeating chain unit of -O-CH2-CH2-. Since the carbon is definitely
adjacent to an oxygen having the larger SOC interaction, the 8g anisotropy
in Brij35 is larger than in HDTCl and SDS. The cases of BPs in the three
surfactants also showed similar micelle dependence and effect of
hydrophobicity.^"^^
On the other hand, the holding time of RP kept inside the micellar
core, which is directly related to the magnitude of MFE as described
above, can be controlled by the hydrophobicity of the solute. In a series of
AQH.-C02-(CH2)„-rCH3 (n = 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8) in Brij35, the longer the
chain is, the larger the MFE on the RP lifetime.^' '^^ From detailed analyses
based on the SLR mechanism taking into account the magnetic field-
independent process such as escaping of the radicals from the Brij35
micelle, it has been shown that the greatest inhibition of the escape is
responsible for the largest MFE in AZ = 8. Analogous influence on MFE has
been observed in BPH.-0-(CH2)._i-CH3 (« = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8).'^

--- Page 276 ---

260 6 Dynamic Spin Chemistry
The above influences have also been confirmed in the case of photo-
induced intermolecular electron transfer between electron donors of N-
ethylcarbazole (ECZ) or A^-nonylcarbazole (NCZ) and an electron acceptor
of tetracyanobenzene (TCNB) in three kinds of micelles.^^ The relative
yields of the escaped radical cation increase by 30 (SDS), 90 (HDTCl) and
50% (Brij35) in the case of RP comprising NCZ-"^ and TCNB-" throughout
the high magnetic fields of 1 -14 T. On the contrary, in the case of RP of
ECZ-^ and TCNB-" the yields are 30 (SDS), 5 (HDTCl) and 5% (Brij35).
This difference clearly shows that the hydrophobicity of solutes is
important to obtain a large MFE also in the yield,
b. Influence of microviscosity and magnetic isotope on MFEs
As SLR depends on the correlation time of the radical Brownian motion,
influence of microviscosity on the RP lifetime governed by the SLR
mechanism has been examined by adding MgCh to an SDS micellar
solution of BR The microviscosities in SDS micelles have been estimated
to be 0.0165, 0.0256 and 0.0430 Nsm"' at [MgCb] = 0, 0.05 and 0.1 mol
dm"^ respectively.•^' Together with the increase in concentrations of
MgCl2, the lifetime of the RP composed of BPH- and R- in SDS micellar
solution has increased by about 30% at 4 T. Further, magnetic isotope
effect (MIE) and influence of microviscosity on MIE have been studied in
the micellar solution. MIE has been observed by 20-60% in 0.04-0.93 T,
as reported,"^^ but no MIE above 2 T has been observed. As for the
influence of microviscosity on MIE, the magnitude of MIE at 0.00165,
0.0256 and 0.0430 Nsm"^ has been obtained to be 23, 20 and 17%,
respectively, at 0.48 T It has been found that there is the tendency for MIE
to decrease in accordance with increase in microviscosity of the media.
This effect could be explained by the 5hf-induced SLR mechanism
including an argument that the correlation time of a relaxation becomes
larger in more viscous solutions.
C. MFEs of Other Reaction Systems
Several interesting MFEs have been detected in other photoreaction
systems.^^'^^^ One of them is the MFE investigated in the photo-induced
electron transfer reaction from polyalkylamine dendrimers to BP in the
aqueous solutions. The dendrimer is well known as a single and
structurally authorized molecule having unique molecular weight, and
hence simplified reaction kinetics and dynamics can be expected compared
with a micelle. Moreover, dendrimers large in size usually have a suitable
pocket (cage) capable of involving guest molecules. In the basic dendrimer
solutions of BP, the third, fourth and fifth generations of the dendrimer
have shown MFEs to increase (ca. 15% in 0.6-14 T) in the yield of BP
anion radicals generated (the RP mechanism).'^^ On the other hand, in bis-
carbene generated from photo-excitation of m-phenylenebis
(phenylmethylene) in rigid matrix at 77 K, fluorescence intensity and

--- Page 277 ---

6.1 Magnetic Field Effects in Photochemical Reactions 261
lifetime of the ^/5-carbene have together decreased with increase in the
magnetic field, which has been explained by magnetic field-induced
mixing of substates of the bis-carhene excited state.'^^ As a rigid system
without a solvent, furthermore, MFE on the charge-transfer fluorescence
and transient photocurrent has recently been investigated within 100 mT in
a 1,2,4,5-tetracyanobenzene-doped poly(A^-vinylcarbazole) film.'^^ The
MFE has been explained by a combination of two types of mechanisms,
namely, the HFC and level crossing mechanisms. Detailed consideration
using the stochastic Liouville equations has proved the stepwise hole-
hopping mechanism.
Titanium oxide (Ti02) is well known as a photocatalyst that converts
solar energy to electric energy by mineralizing materials through the redox
reaction. Therefore, a certain extent of MFE can be expected in the redox
reaction in which an electron participates. In an experiment in which a
mixed solution of an aqueous H2PtCl6 solution and methanol suspending
Ti02 powder is irradiated with a Xe lamp, the volume of hydrogen gas
generated has been measured in zero and several high magnetic fields of
up to ca. 14 T.'^^ Fig. 6-1-6 shows the MFD of the ratio (VB/VO) of the gas
volume (VB) at the high magnetic field (B) toward that (Vo) at a zero field.
The volume decreases by 85% at 4 T and 50-80% at 14 T. At present, the
MFE on this T1O2 redox reaction seems ascribable to the Ag mechanism in
RP consisting of a hole and an electron separated on the TiOz-Pt
semiconductor. The ^RP has two deactivation pathways, the recombination
of a hole and an electron and ISC interconversion to "^RP. If it is assumed
that an initially populated state is 'RP and an efficient generation of a
hydrogen gas is via 'RP, then the Ag mechanism would reduce the gas
volume as a result of enhanced ISC to "^RP as a sink. As an opposite MFE,
an increase of ca. 10% in the yield of acetone generated in the

decomposition of butyl alcohol on TiOi has recently been observed at
1.5 T.^^^ These mutually opposite MFEs might be attributable to the type
and/or hole size of TiOa. In any case, since the study on TiOa has just
started, many characteristics of the TiO: suspension and experimental
factors must be investigated for the purpose of establishing MFEs in the
field of semiconductors.
6.1.4 Conclusion
By exploring MFEs in a magnetic field range of up to 15 T, it has been
discovered that reversal in MFEs occurs on a general basis. In ^BR and
^RP, this has been attributed to the 5g-induced SLR mechanism with a very
short correlation time of a few picoseconds. In ^BR, it has been ascribed to
the Ag mechanism. These MFEs have become universally known facts in
photochemical reactions at present, and the investigation of MFEs has
entered the next stage of exploration where new phenomena are expected
to be found, for example, by combining MFEs observed thus far on
photochemical reactions with the technique of high magnetic field-induced
orientation and levitation of materials.

6.2 Magnetic Field Effects in Photosensitive Electrodes
The reaction mechanism of photochemical reactions in condensed phase
has been elucidated by magnetic field effects on reaction kinetics or
yields.'"^^ As a consequence, magnetic field is expected to provide a novel
means of controlling photoinduced electron transfer and the succeeding
processes including photoelectrochemical reactions.
Magnetic field effects on photocurrents in organic films were
reported very early by Sokolik and Frankevich.^* The magnetic field effects
were explained in terms of a kind of Ag mechanism operating in electron-
hole pairs (exciton) where singlet-triplet transitions are assumed to occur
by the difference in g-values between electron and hole. The
photoconductivity in organic films increased in the presence of a magnetic
field. Magnetic field effects on the photoconductivity of poly-A^-
vinylcarbazole films were also reported by Itaya and coworkers.^^ The
photocurrent increased with increase of magnetic field in lower magnetic
fields (< 0.1 T) and reached saturation in higher magnetic fields (> 0.1 T).
Similar magnetic field effects were also observed in the presence of
dimethylterephalate as the doping agent. Magnetic field effects on the
photoconductivity in an organic polymer (a poly-phenylene vinylene
derivative) with Ceo as the dopant were examined by Frankevich and
coworkers.^^ The photocurrent increased with increase of magnetic field in
lower magnetic fields (< 0.15 T) and reached saturation in higher magnetic
fields (> 0.15 T). However, no magnetic field effects on the photoinduced
discharge rates were observed in the case of Cao-doped poly-N-vinylcarbazole.^^
Thus, a number of magnetic field effects on photoconductivity in organic films
have been reported.
Magnetic field effects on photoelectrochemical reactions in
photosensitive electrodes were expected to provide a useful method for
verifying the complicated mechanisms of the reactions and promote
research on the application of magnetic field effects for molecular devices.
However, very little work on magnetic field effects for such use has been
reported.

6.2.1 Magnetic Field Effects in Photosensitive Electrodes Modified
with Donor-Acceptor Linked Compounds
Yonemura and coworkers have studied magnetic field effects on the
photoelectrochemical reactions of photosensitive electrodes modified with
zinc-teraphenylporphyrin-viologen linked compounds (ZnP(n)V(n =
4,6,8)) as a donor-acceptor linked compound, as shown in Fig. 6-2-1.^'^^
Modified electrodes were prepared by depositing the mixed monolayer
with ZnP(n)V and arachidic acid (1 : 10) on ITO electrodes by the standard
Langmuir Blodgett method. The magnetic field effects on the
photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out using a three-
electrode cell. The photocurrents of the modified electrode were measured
under various applied potentials (0-0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl) in the presence of
excess triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial electron donor under a
nitrogen atmosphere. Electric field was applied parallel to the magnetic
field to avoid the influence of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) force.
Photoirradiation with visible light (> 400 nm) upon the ZnP(8)V-
modified electrode afforded anodic photocurrents. Similar results were
observed in ZnP(4)V- and ZnP(6)V-modified electrodes. The photocurrent
action spectra of the modified ZnP(A2)V-electrodes were in good agreement
with the absorption spectra of the porphyrin moiety of ZnP(A2)V in LB
films. The result strongly indicated that the photocurrents of the ZnP(n)V-
modified electrodes were attributable to the excitation of the porphyrin
moiety of ZnP(n)V.
In the presence of a magnetic field, the photocurrent clearly increased
(Fig. 6-2-1). The magnetic responses were reproducible (over 20 times).
The same magnetic field effects were observed when the direction of the
magnetic field was reversed. In addition, similar magnetic field effects

were obtained when the electric field was perpendicular to the magnetic
field. Therefore, the magnetic field effects on photoelectrochemical
reaction in the modified electrodes are not influenced by the direction of
the electric field to the magnetic field. These results indicated that the
magnetic field effects on the photocurrents did not come from MHD force.
The magnitude of magnetic field effects on the photocurrent is
expressed as follows:
e = (/(H)-7(0))/7(0) X100 (1)
where 7(H) and 7(0) are the photocurrent in the presence and absence of
magnetic fields, respectively. The Q value (%) increased with increase of
the magnetic field in lower magnetic fields (< 0.3 T) and became constant
in higher magnetic fields (> 0.3 T) (ca. 15% in the case of the ZnP(8)V-
modified electrode), as shown in Fig. 6-2-2.
The Q values due to the ZnP(8)V- and the ZnP(6)V-modified
electrodes were twice that due to the ZnP(4)V-modified electrode. The
magnetic field effects on the lifetimes of radical pairs with ZnP(8)V and
ZnP(6)V are larger than on those with ZnP(4)V in solution.'^^ The
influence of spacer chain length on the magnetic field effects was in good
agreement with that on the lifetimes of biradicals. Therefore, the magnetic
field effects on the photocurrents can be explained by the relaxation
mechanism in radical pairs.^ "^^
As a reference system, another modified electrode was prepared
using the porphyrin derivative without the viologen moiety (ZnP(8)AB), as
shown in Fig. 6-2-1. The photocurrent action spectrum of the ZnP(8)AB-
modified electrode was similar to those of ZnP(Az)V-modified electrodes.
However, no magnetic field effects on photocurrents were observed in the
case of the ZnP(8)AB-modified electrode. These results indicate that the

--- Page 282 ---

266 6 Dynamic Spin Chemistry
magnetic field effects in ZnP(A2)V-modified electrodes can be ascribed to
the photogenerated biradical.
The reaction scheme of the photoelectrochemical reaction of ZnP(n) V-
modified electrodes is summarized in Fig. 6-2-2. The magnetic field effects
on photocurrents in ZnP(A2)V-modified electrodes as photosensitive
electrodes were clearly ascribed to the photogeneration of the triplet
biradical ^(ZnP"^ -V^) via the intramolecular electron-transfer process at the
ITO electrode surface. The intersystem crossing process of the triplet
biradical (/:isc in Fig. 6-2-2) will become the rate-determining step for the
biradical to decay via reverse electron transfer to the ground state. In the
presence of higher magnetic fields, the intersystem crossing process is
controlled by relaxation from triplet sublevels to the corresponding singlet
(relaxation mechanism).^^^^ As the intersystem crossing process was
suppressed with increase in magnetic field, the reduced viologen (V^) in
the triplet biradical was better able to transfer the electron to the ITO
electrode. As a consequence, the photocurrents increased in the presence of
a magnetic field, as shown in Fig. 6-2-1. In other words, the magnetic field
effects on the photocurrents provide experimental evidence indicating that
the photoelectrochemical responses of ZnP(«)V-modified electrodes can be
ascribed to the sequential electron-transfer process via the viologen moiety
as a mediator between the porphyrin moiety and the ITO electrode.
The influence of applied potential (E /V vs. Ag/AgCl) on the
magnetic field effects in ZnP(8)V-modified electrode was also examined.
The photocurrents increased with increase in the applied potential,
indicating that the rate constant (k^sc in Fig. 6-2-2) of the electron transfer
between the reduced viologen (V^) moiety and the ITO electrode
increased as the applied potential became more positive. On the contrary,
the Q values of the ZnP(8)V-modified electrode at 0.5 T decreased with
increase in the applied potential. In other words, the magnitude of the
magnetic field effects could be controlled by the applied potential. The rate
of the intramolecular reverse electron transfer in ZnP(8)V is controlled by
the rate (kisc in Fig. 6-2-2) of the intersystem crossing process. The
photocurrent generation is proportional to A:esc/(^esc + ^isc). The kesc value
should increase with increasing applied potential in the positive direction,
while the A:isc value is independent of the applied potential. The influence of
the magnetic field on the photocurrent decreased with increasing applied
potential in the positive direction. Thus the Q value must decrease as the
applied potential becomes more positive. On the basis of these
observations, the magnetic field effects on photoelectrochemical reactions
in photosensitive electrodes can be controlled by the applied potential.

from those of bulk crystals due to quantum size effects. A number of
synthetic methods have been reported and their characteristics have been
intensively studied by various sepectroscopic methods^' ''^^ In addition,
electrodes modified with semiconductor nanoparticles (Q-CdS (cadmium
sulfide)) were fabricated by immobilizing them on a self-assembled
monolayer of hexanedithiol prepared on the gold electrode as reported by
Bard and coworkers.'^^ Chazalviel reported the magnetic field effects on
photoelectrochemical reactions of bulk semiconductor (GaAs) by the use of
circularly polarized light.'^^ The magnitude of the magnetic field effects was
very small and the magnetic field effects were explained in terms of the
classical models for electrochemical transfer at the semiconducting
photoelectrode. However, magnetic field effects on the photoelectrochemical
reactions of photosensitive electrodes modified with semiconductor
nanoparticles were not reported.
Yonemura and coworkers have studied the magnetic field effects on
photoelectrochemical reactions of photosensitive electrodes modified with
semiconductor (CdS) and diluted magnefic semiconductor (Cdi-xMn^S)
nanoparticles (Q-CdS and e-Cdi-xMn^S).^'* '^^ Q-CdS and Q-Cdi-xMuxS
were prepared by the use of dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (AOT) reversed
micelles as reported previously by Steigerwald.^'^^ The size of Q-CdS or Q-
Cdi-xMuxS was controlled by the water-to-surfactant ratio (W value =
[H20]/[A0T]) in heptane soluUon. The relative amount of Mn^"^ ions
compared to Cd^^ ions in the semiconductor is defined as Q-Cdi-xMuxS or
Cdi.xMnxS, where X = [Mn'^]/([Cd'1 + [Mn'^]), assuming that all Cd'%
Mn^^ and S^" in the mixed solution formed the foregoing particles. Self-
assembled monolayers (SAMs) of 1,6-hexanedithiol were prepared by
immersing gold electrodes in an ethanol solution of the 1,6-hexanedithiol.
Electrodes modified with Q-CdS and Q-Cd].xMnxS were fabricated by
immersing the SAM-electrodes in an AOT heptane solution including Q-
CdS and g-Cdi-xMnxS dispersion.
Absorption spectra of Q-CdS with various W values (1.0-7.0) were
observed in heptane. As the W value decreased, both the absorption onset
and absorption peak were blue-shifted. For example, in the case ofW = 4.0,
the peak absorption was observed at 372 nm (3.33 eV), corresponding to a
particle diameter of ca. 3 nm. These results were caused by quantum size
effects.^^' ^^^ In the case of Q-Cdi-xMuxS, both the absorption onset and
absorption peak showed similar blue-shift as the W value decreased. These
results were also ascribed to quantum size effects." ''^
Photoirradiation of the Q-CdS (W = 5.4)-modified electrode afforded
stable anodic photocurrents. The photocurrent action spectrum in the Q-
CdS-modified electrode was in good agreement with the absorption
spectrum of Q-CdS in heptane. The results strongly indicated that the
photocurrents could be ascribed to the photoexcitation of Q-CdS on the
gold electrode surface.

268 6 Dynamic Spin Chemistry
In the presence of a magnetic field (0.5 T), photocurrents appreciably
decreased. The magnitude of magnetic field effects on the photocurrent is
also evaluated by the Q-value as defined by Eq. (1). The Q-value in the Q-
CdS (W= 5.4)-modified electrode was ca. -3 % at 0.5 T by Eq. (1). Similar
magnetic field effects were also observed in the case of the Q-CdS {W =
4.0) or {W - 3.0)-modified electrodes with different diameters of
nanoparticles. Opposite magnetic responses were observed in comparison
with the ZnP(n)V-modified electrodes, as shown in Fig. 6-2-1. The results
are probably due to the different mechanism of magnetic field effects
between the semiconductor nanoparticles (2-CdS) and the ZnP(/2)V-
modified electrodes. As a reference system, an electrode modified with
large CdS particles was also examined. In the CdS-modified electrode,
stable photocurrents were observed in the anodic direction. The
photocurrent action spectrum of the CdS-modified electrode was red-
shifted more than that of the g-CdS-modified electrode. This result is
consistent with the quantum size effects described above in the absorption
spectra. However, no magnetic field effects on photocurrents were
obtained in the CdS-modified electrode. Comparing the Q-CdS- and the
CdS-modified electrodes, the quantum size effects (quantum confinement
effect) in Q-CdS are most likely responsible for the magnetic field effects
observed in the Q-CdS-modified electrodes.
In a diluted magnetic semiconductor and its nanoparticles, a variety
of unusual magnetic and magneto-optical properties due to exchange
interaction between the band electrons and the magnetic ions have been
reported.^^ ^^^ When diluted magnetic semiconductor nanoparticles were
used instead of semiconductor nanoparticles, enhancement of the magnetic
field effects on the photocurrents in photosensitive electrodes was
expected. Photoirradiation of the (2-Cdi .vMuxS-modified electrode also
afforded stable anodic photocurrents as similar to the Q-CdS modified
electrodes, as shown in Fig. 6-2-3. The Q value in the Q-Cdi^MnxS (X =
0.2, W= 3.0)-modified electrode was ca. -8% at 0.76 T by Eq. (1.) Larger
reduction {Q = ca. -8 %) of photocurrent from the Q-Cdi-xMn^S (X = 0.2,
W = 3.0)-modified electrode was observed compared with that {Q - ca. -3
%) from the Q-CdS (W= 3.0)-modified electrode. As a reference system,
the electrode modified with large Cdi-^Mn^S (X = 0.2) particles was also
examined. Although stable photocurrents were generated in the anodic
direction, no magnetic field effects on the photocurrents could be observed
in the Cdi-xMn;^S-modified electrode. The results are fairly consistent with
those of the Q-CdS-modified electrodes showing the presence of the
quantum size effect (quantum confinement effect) on the reduction of
photocurrents induced by the magnetic field. Magnetic interactions of Q-
Cdi-;^MnxS were found to increase with decreasing particle size, as reported
by Pileni and coworkers.'^^ Thus, based on these observations, the large
magnetic field effects on photocurrents observed in the (2-Cdi.;^MnxS-

modified electrodes are most likely ascribable to the quantum size effect
(quantum confinement effect) and exchange effects in the exciton states
due to the incorporated Mn^^ ions in the Q-CduxMuxS.
Magnetic field effects on exciton emission were reported by Oka and
coworkers and in diluted magnetic semiconductor microcrystallites in a
Si02 glass support/^^ Red-shift and enhancement of the emission band
were observed in the presence of high magnetic fields. Therefore, the
magnetic field effects on photocurrents observed in this study may be
ascribed to the magnetic field effects on lifetimes of exciton and/or surface
states in the Q-CdS- and Q-Cdi.xMnxS-modified electrodes.
The magnetic field effects on photocurrents observed in the electrode
modified with semiconductor nanoparticles (Q-CdS and Q-Cdi-xMuxS) are
most likely explained by the electron-hole pair mechanism.'^^ The reaction
scheme of the photoelectrochemical reaction of electrodes modified with
semiconductor particles is summarized in Fig. 6-2-4. In the close electron-

hole pair, the distance between the electron and hole is short, and the
exchange interaction of the electron-hole pair is not negligible. In the
separated electron-hole pair, the distance between the electron and hole is
long, and the exchange interaction of the electron-hole pair is negligible.
Singlet (S)-triplet (T) conversion of the electron-hole pair occurs in the
separated electron-hole pair. The free charge carriers decrease in the
presence of a magnetic field, since the S-T conversion is suppressed by the
magnetic field. In the case of semiconductor nanoparticles, the lifetime of
the electron-hole pair (exciton) is long enough to be perturbed by the
magnetic field, while the lifetime is too short to be influenced by the
magnetic field in the case of semiconductor large particles. The quantum
confinement effect is analogous to the cage effect in the radical pair
mechanism. ^'^^
Konno and coworkers have studied high magnetic field effects (~8T)
on photoelectrochemical reactions of photosensitive electrodes modified
with poly(A^-methylpyrrole).'^^ The poly(A^-methylpyrrole)-modified
electrodes were fabricated by the electrochemical polymerization of A^-
methylpyrrole. In acetonitrile solution, the initial photocurrent increased
with increase in magnetic field from 0 to 7 T. On the other hand, in
dichloromethane, magnetic dependence of the photocurrents was observed
not only in the initial but in the second and third photocurrent responses as
well. In addition, the photocurrents increased by repetition of
measurement. In the repeated measurements, strong magnetic fields
accelerated the increasing photocurrent as compared with that in a zero
magnetic field. The result cannot be explained by the MHD effect and is

--- Page 287 ---

6.2 Magnetic Field Effects in Photosensitive Electrodes 271
probably ascribable to the change in polymer orientation due to the
magnetic field accompanied by the photocurrent generation. The
mechanism of the magnetic field effects is different from the radical pair or
electron-hole pair mechanism as described above.
Wakasa and coworkers have recently studied the magnetic field
effects on photocatalytic reactions with ultrafine TiOz particles.^^^
Magnetically induced acceleration of the photocatalytic reaction was
observed. Opposite magnetic responses on the reaction were observed in
comparison with those in the photoelectrochemical reaction in the
electrodes modified with semiconductor nanoparticles described above
(Fig. 6-2-4).
The magnetic field effects in photosensitive electrodes can be
expected to lead to an epoch-making means of reaction control involving
photoelectrochemical processes and related systems such as highly
functional nanomaterials.

6.3 Spin Probe and Spin Trapping Studies on the Magnetic Field
Effects on Chemical Reactions in the Nanospace of MCM-41
6.3.1 Magnetic Field-dependent Photoreactions in MCM-41
Nanospace
Many experimental data have been accumulated for the magnetic field
effects on the chemical reactions that produce a radical pair as the
intermediate. They are systematically understood under the so-called
radical pair mechanism, which postulates a pair of radicals as the reaction
intermediates. When the radicals keep pairing for a period longer than their
spin-lattice relaxation times, the observed magnetic field effect is usually
large.'^ If the intermediate radicals are neutral, this long pairing time is
possible only for the systems composed of the reactant groups which are
linked by a flexible chain group or for those incorporated in a nanospace.
In the latter case a micelle is frequently employed as the donor of the
reaction space. The long spin lattice relaxation times make it possible to
change the state of electron spins of the radical pair by the ESR technique
to control the reaction.^^ This new phase of research broadens the field and
is called "spin chemistry." '^ On the other hand, chemistry in the
nanodimension has become popular due to the development of new
experimental techniques. In addition the discovery of new mesoporous
materials,^^ such as M41S, has made it possible to conduct research on
physicochemical processes in nanospace from the most basic point of
view. Therefore, it is a natural consequence to observe the magnetic field
effect on a chemical reaction in the nanochannel of MCM-41, which is a
representative mesoporous material that provides a new, regularly ordered,
stable and well-defined nanospace.^*
Figure 6-3-1(A) shows the magnetic field (j^o) dependences in the
product yield of the photoreduction of xanthone (XO) in alcoholic
solutions. A schematic view of the flow system specially designed for the
photolysis in the MCM-41 nanochannel is given as Fig. 6-3-1(B). Here a
laser pulse excites XO to the triplet state, which then abstracts a hydrogen
atom from xanthene (XH2) added as the hydrogen donor, and a pair of
intermediate radicals XH and XOH are produced. In the present case
bixanthyl (XH-XH) was detected chromatographically as one of the
products which was formed from the coupling reaction of the two XH
radicals. A large magnetic field effect was found on the photoreaction in an
alcoholic solution flowing in a quartz column packed with MCM-41.^^ The
effect is higher than 25% at 500 mT, when 2-propanol and MCM-41 with
nanochannels whose diameter is 2.5 nm were employed as the solvent and
the filler of the reaction column, respectively. The magnetic field effect
appears to increase steadily with increase in the magnetic field (Fig. 6-3-
1(A)). The effect was reduced when the diameter of the nanochannel

became larger and/or ethanol was employed as the solvent.^'^^ To
investigate the mechanism the spin-trapping reaction yield was monitored
for the same reaction system^^ employing phenyl-r-butylnitrone (PBN) as
the spin trap. From the result we confirmed the following: transient free
radicals are really formed during the reaction and the concentration of free
radical intermediate increases with increasing magnetic field. These results
suggest that the radical pair mechanism is appropriate in explaining the
magnetic field effects. In fact, quenching of the TEMPO (2,2,5,5-
tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl) radical, added in the same reaction system,
is dependent on the magnetic field as expected by the radical pair model.^^
In summary, the magnetic field effect in the photoreaction observed in the
nanochannel of MCM-41 is due to the modulation of the spin-state
conversion rate for the radical pair intermediate by the applied magnetic
field. This spin conversion is caused by the spin-lattice relaxation of the
component free radicals of the pair. Since the relaxation time is assumed to

Fig. 6-3-2 A model for the mechanism of the magnetic field dependence in the photoreduction of an
alcoholic (ROH) solution of xanthone (XO) in the presence of xanthene (XH2) in the MCM-
41 nanochannel. Photo-excited xanthone (XO*) abstracts a hydrogen from alcohol and the
radical pair (XOH-R'OH) in the triplet state is formed, which is then converted into the pair
(XOH-XH) through a hydrogen transfer reaction from the donor XH.. When the radical
pair does not recombine in the nanochannel, the two radicals lose correlation of their
positions.

last a few microseconds the two intermediate radicals should keep pairing
for more than several microseconds in 2-propanol during the flow in the
column packed with MCM-41.
Figure 6-3-2 depicts a model for the mechanism of the magnetic field
dependence in the present system.^ ^^ Since the radical pair is separated by
the solvent molecules which do not diffuse rapidly as in bulk solution, the
recombination probability becomes dependent on the magnetic field. We
assume that the long lifetime of the radical pair becomes possible because
the collective nature of the solvent molecules specially endowed in the
nanochannel prevents the two pairing radicals from separating. The rapid
flow of the solution molecules in the nanochannel can also be explained by
the collectivity of the solvent molecules, which may reduce the momentum
transfer in the colinear direction from the flowing molecules to the
nanochannel. Thus the correlation between the positions of two solute
molecules may increase, i.e., the radical pair keeps pairing for a long time,
more than several microseconds. Thus the pair of radicals does not diffuse
away before recombination or flowing out of the nanochannel.
6.3.2 A New View of the Physicochemical Processes in Nanosystems
The following two observations should be noted, (i) An alcoholic solution
flows in the nanochannel of MCM-41 under the conditions usually
employed in liquid chromatography. This is unexpected since Poiseulle's
law^^ predicts a flow rate much less than that expected in the above
experiment, (ii) The intermediate radicals born as a pair should keep
pairing for a period longer than several microseconds. This is also

--- Page 291 ---

6.3 Dynamics of Molecules in the Nanospace 275
unexpected since the usual diffusion rate constant predicts the separation
of these within submicroseconds. Although these phenomena have been
tentatively explained by the collectivity of the solvent molecules, they
must be confirmed through other experiments and discussions of the
results. The dynamics of the solution molecules in the nanochannel of
MCM-41have been studied by several research groups by the pulsed-field-
gradient NMR (PFGNMR) method.^'^^^ Hansen's group conducted an
experiment in which the diffusion rate drastically changed by the surface
modification of the nanochannel.'^^ Stallmach et al. observed that the rate
of self-diffusion of benzene molecules in the nanochannel of MCM-41
exceeds that in the bulk and presented a model in which molecules diffuse
through in the gas phase.^'^ These results indicate that chemical and
physical processes in the nanochannel of MCM-41 are not described
exactly by the classical rules for the bulk system. In the following sections
the above anomalies of the molecules in the nanochannel are discussed in
more detail. Below are the structures of the three aminoxyl radicals which
appear frequently in the following sections.

Figure 6-3-3(A) shows the ESR spectra observed for the solution of
DTBN, TEMPO and TEMPOL ((a), (b) and (c), respectively) flowing in a
quartz column packed with MCM-41 powder together with the simulation
for the DTBN spectrum (d). The flow apparatus is the same as that shown
in Fig. 6-3-1(B). Relative amplitudes of the three hyperfine components of
the first derivative spectra (a) and (b) of Fig. 6-3-3(A) for DTBN and
TEMPO, respectively, are 0.92-0.93, 1.0 and 0.8 from the lower field line.
From the simulation we obtain the anisotropy parameter M = tx^Jh of 15
for the rotational diffusion of the DTBN radical, where TL, indicates the
rotational correlation time along the L-molecular axis (L = x, y or z).'^^
Since the solution also exists between the MCM-41 particles, the spectrum
is constituted of the two components from the radicals in the two regions,
but the exchange rate between these two may be rapid enough since the
line shape is symmetrical. The volume inside the nanochannel is a little
larger than that between the particles, so the spectrum for the solution
inside the nanochannel must be more anisotropic than that observed here.'"^^
This will be discussed again in the last paragraph of this section (see Fig.

3-3(A) is larger than the others, the TEMPOL radical prefers the rotation
around the x axis, which is the direction of H-bonding for the OH group of
TEMPOL. Fig. 6-3-3(B) shows the time profile of the ESR signal
amplitude when a certain volume (0.7 ml) of the spin probe solution
flowed into the column packed with MCM-41.'^^ From the flow profiles
we conclude that: (i) The period of time for the spin probe molecules to
pass through the ESR cavity is nearly equal to that calculated from the
flow rate and the injected solution volume, (ii) As the time profiles (a), (d)
and (e) show, the time duration of the spin probe signal is approximately
inversely proportional to the flow rate. Since it has already been proven
that the aminoxyl radicals mostly exist in the nanochannel, the above
results show that the solution actually "moves through" the nanochannel of
MCM-41 at a pressure usually employed for liquid chromatography (< 10
MPa). The modification in the time profile by the different spin probe
radicals may be due to their interaction mainly with the surface of the

6.3 Dynamics of Molecules in the Nanospace 277
MCM-41 particles, which is covered with Si-OH groups. Since the DTBN
molecules may avoid the small spaces between the MCM-41 particles due
to a rather hydrophobic character, the ESR amplitude reaches maximum in
a short time. On the other hand, since the TEMPOL radicals may get into
the small spaces between the microparticles, it takes a little longer time
before the ESR amplitude reaches a maximum value. In the decreasing
phase of the ESR signal, the long tail for the TEMPOL radical, as trace (c)
shows, can also be explained in the same way. Recently, a group suggests
that the water molecules diffuse across the wall of the nanochannel of
MCM-41.^^'^^^ However, we believe that reassessments of their diffusion
data should be made taking into account the collective nature of the
molecules in the nanochannel.'^^
6.3.4 Spin Probe and NMR Studies on the Dynamics and Distribution
of Solution Molecules in the MCM-41 Nanochannel
Since the magnetic field effects have been observed for the reactions in a
solution that flows in an open nanochannel, the dynamics and distribution
of the molecules must be studied precisely from a basic point of view to
interpret the new status of the solvent molecules in the nanochannel. The
four spectra (a)-(d) in Fig. 6-3-4(A) are the '^C NMR spectra of the
mixture solution of 2-propanol and cyclohexane in which MCM-41 is
suspended.'^^ The NMR spectra for the same solution in the Nucleosil-50
suspension (e) and clear solution (f) are also shown. Since all the peaks of
spectra (a) - (d) appear as single broad lines of the pure Lorentzian type,
these molecules must exchange positions at a rate of several hundred times
per second between the nanospace and the space among the particles, since
the latter should give sharp lines like spectrum (f). This kind of rapid
diffusion through the nanochannel cannot be treated by the Stokes model.
The system should give a much broader spectrum if the solution stays long
in the nanochannel.
To obtain further information on the dynamics of molecules in the
nanochannel, the solution ESR spectrum of a spin probe, DTBN (di-t-
butylnitroxide), incorporated in the nanochannel of MCM-41 was
observed. Fig. 6-3-4(B) shows the ESR spectrum of a 2-propanol solution
in the nanochannel (a) and its simulation spectrum (b).'^^ In addition to
these, spectrum (c) is that observed in the absence of MCM-41, and
spectrum (d) is for DTBN in a mixed solvent composed of cyclohexane
and 2-propanol at a ratio of 3:1 in the nanochannel. ESR spectrum (a) is a
three-Une one which is similar to that in the bulk solution (c) except for the
relative peak heights among the three lines and their linewidths. Since the
ESR spectrum (a) appears broader than spectrum (c), the mobility of
DTBN should be slightly lower in the nanochannel. The averaged
correlation time (TC) of the anisotropic magnetic interaction for the
simulated spectrum (b) was 8.0 x 10~'* s, considerably longer than the

value in the bulk/^^ Since the spectral simulation was successfully made
assuming a preferential rapid rotational diffusion of the radical along the
longest molecular axis connecting the two t-butyl carbons, the DTBN
molecule may be in a cyrindrical space. We consider this to be a cage-like
space temporarily made by the solvent molecules. Although the
nanochannel provides a cyrindrical space, the diameter is too large to
directly affect the mode of rotational diffusion of the solute molecule. It
may be true, however, that the solute distribution has some inhomogeneity
in the nanochannel. When a hydrophobic solvent, e.g., cyclohexane, is
employed, the NO group of the DTBN molecule may interact strongly
with the surface, and an ESR spectrum for an immobilized nitroxide
radical (not shown) is observed. When a small amount of 2-propanol was
added to this system, the ESR spectrum changed to a spectrum similar to
(d). This means that 2-propanol strips the DTBN molecules off the surface

of the nanochannel. These observations indicate that the Hquid molecules
are distributed inhomogeneously in the nanochannel.
Since the molecular dimension of cyclohexane is slightly smaller
than that of DTBN, TR (rotational correlation time) for the intramolecular
magnetic interactions of cyclohexane must be less than that for DTBN.
Thus, the homogeneous linewidth of the NMR spectrum should be as
narrow as that in the bulk solution even if the liquid is in the nanochannel
of MCM-41. Therefore, the broad linewidth of Fig. 6-3-4(A) should be due
to inhomogeneous line broadening. Two mechanisms are considered: 1)
anisotropy in the diamagnetic susceptibility of MCM-41 particle; 2)
magnetic interaction with the hydrogen nuclei on the neighboring
molecules. If the molecules move collectively, the second interaction is not
averaged out during the time the cluster is wandering in the nanochannel.
Since the linewidths for the system in Nucleosil are only a few Hz, the
latter may be the main cause of the broad linewidths in Fig. 6-3-4(A).
6.3.5 Spin Probe and NMR Studies on the Phase Separation of the
Molecular System in the Nanochannel of MCM-41
The inhomogeneous distribution and phase separation of simple fluids
have been studied in the micropore.'^^ Phase separation of rather complex
systems including organic solutions as well as long-chained n-alkanes has
been observed in the nanochannel of MCM-41.'^^^^ A spin probe ESR
study has been made on the dynamics of 2-propanol and water molecules
in the nanochannel of MCM-41 at various temperatures. In the former
system, 2-propanol is separated into two phases: one with molecules
immobilized in the ESR time scale and the other with mobile molecules,
even at temperatures more than 40 degrees higher than the bulk melting
point. In the case of water, on the other hand, only the "immobilized"
molecule was detected at a temperature as high as 313 K. In both systems,
the DTBN molecule undergoes highly anisotropic rotational diffusion to
reduce resistance from the solvent molecules in the nanochannel. These
results are explained using a model in which the spin probe molecule is
incorporated in a cage made by the intermolecular network intensified in
the nanochannel. ^^^
High-resolution solid-state ^^C NMR spectra of long-chained n-
alkanes, which were filled in the liquid state into the nanochannel of
MCM-41, have been observed.^^^ Each spectrum has two sets of peaks: one
from very flexible molecules and the other from molecules with no
significant flexibility, which are characterized by the carbon spin-lattice
relaxation times of less than 1 s and that of longer than 10 s, respectively.^^^
This phenomenon is ascribed to the phase separation of these alkanes in
the nanochannel, i.e., the amorphous and crystalline phases, respectively.
The latter phase of long-chained n-alkanes in the nanochannel have
characteristics similar to those of the bulk crystals, which change

--- Page 296 ---

280 6 Dynamic Spin Chemistry
alternatively between triclinic and orthorhombic following the change in
the carbon number in the molecule from even to odd, respectively. These
features of the long-chained w-alkanes in the nanochannel were confirmed
by observing the ESR spectra of the free radicals produced by y-
irradiation.^^^ It must be difficult for these A2-alkane molecules located near
the wall of the nanochannel to form a regular crystal, thus the crystalline
and the amorphous phases may be formed in the central and the peripheral
portions, respectively, in the nanochannel.
6.3.6 Conclusion
The magnetic field affects considerably the yield of photoreduction of
xanthone in an alcoholic solution flowing in a column packed with MCM-
41 powder. This effect has been explained by the magnetic field-dependent
spin-lattice relaxation times of the intermediate radicals that form the
radical pair. Since this mechanism assumes a long lifetime of the pair,
diffusion of molecules in the nanochannel must be suppressed below a
very low level. At the same time the solution should flow in the
nanochannel at a rate almost the same as that for the flow between the
MCM-41 granules. These phenomena for the alcoholic solutions, i.e., rapid
flow but slow diffusion, are contradictory in the bulk, but can be
interpreted by the concepts of "collective flow" and ''collective diffusion"
in the nanochannel. These have been confirmed by spin probe ESR and
NMR observations for these systems. In addition, two novel phenomena in
the nanochannel of MCM-41 have been noted briefly: phase separation of
a mixture solution composed of 2-propanol and cyclohexane, which are
missible with each other in the bulk, and phase separation of pure long-
chained n-alkanes.

6.4 From Spin Dynamics in Ionic Pairs to Softening of Crystals
in Magnetic Field
Spin-dependent radical reactions controlled by diffusion in liquids are well
known in spin chemistry. Moreover, there are theoretical predictions' ^^ and
direct experimental evidence'^"'^^ of magnetic field influence on spin-
dependent reactions between structural defects in crystals (dopant ions,
electrons captured into dislocation core, clusters containing few
paramagnetic atoms, etc.). This work is a search for spin-dependent
reactions in solids controlled by diffusion, thermal activation and plastic
deformation of crystals. The ultimate aim is spin-dependent control over
plasticity and luminescence that are sensitive to clusterization of
paramagnetic ions in crystal lattice and wide practical applications of
magnetic field effects controlling the physical properties of crystals. Since
magnetic field influence on the cluster formation in a crystal is a main
attribute of the spin-selective process, a crystal lattice must be
nonmagnetic, keep spin polarization in radical pairs, and have
comparatively fast diffusion of paramagnetic ions in the lattice. Good
candidates of crystalline media are ionic crystals (NaCl, LiF, KCl, Csl,
etc.) doped with Eu ions.
The Eu^^ ions coupled with vacancy provide electro-neutrality of the
defect (so-called dipole). A general method for obtaining Eu"^ clusters is
the thermally activated aggregation of single Eu~^ dipoles by diffusion.
Therefore, the precipitation process can be slowed down or accelerated by
varying the temperature of the crystal as a whole. In contrast with liquids,
diffusion in crystal lattice proceeds by limited numbers of aggregation
ways and possible precipitate structures depend on the symmetry of the
host material and ionic radius of the doping atoms.''* The final products of
Eu aggregation in NaCl are thoroughly studied. Large clusters
(precipitates) allow researchers to disdnguish them and determine their

Energy values below each cluster are calculated binding energies per one dipole. Zero-
energy level corresponds to energy of isolated impurity-vacancy dipoles. Compact
configuration A is the most stable form of dimer. To construct the A dimer dipoles should
perform several diffusion jumps in the vicinity of each other, each jump demanding more
and more activation energy, so the rate of A dimer formation is very slow as compared with
others. Concentration of B dimers is very low because they are composed of rare next-
nearest-neighbors dipoles. The binding energies of C and D dimers are almost equal but C
dimers are formed faster than D dimers due to topological reasons. Thus, at the first stage of
aggregation, the concentration of C dimers is the highest. In the next step C type dimers
block subsequent aggregation of dipoles, since the addition of one more dipole to the C
dimer is not available for binding energy. To come out from the aggregation deadlock C
dimers should be reorganized into other configurations. Dimers of types A and D are the
nucleating centers of quasi-two-dimensional precipitates lying in the (013) and (111)
crystallographic planes, respectively.

incorporated into the crystal lattice and they determine all subsequent
aggregation pathways. Theoretical calculations''' gave several possible
configurations of initial clusters in NaCl crystals (Fig. 6-4-1). Aggregation
pathways branch at the stage of dimer formation (a dimer is a cluster
containing two Eu^^ and two vacancies). This stage of aggregation plays a
key role in the formation of big clusters because the probability of the
addition of the next dipole to the dimer strongly depends on the dimer
configuration. For example, the addition of dipoles to B and C types of the
dimers is disadvantageous for thermodynamical reasons (Fig. 6-4-1). Thus
some of the initially formed dimer configurations must be destroyed by
thermal fluctuations and escape the dipoles to form other more favorable A
and D dimer configurations. Dimer evolution could be sensitive to
magnetic field if exchange interaction between dimer spins provides spin
correlation for a long time and has a short time "window" during which
energy splitting between exchanges states becomes the same order of value
as the Zeeman energy. This window is initiated by thermal fluctuations and
does not destroy spin correlation itself in the absence of a magnetic field
because of total spin saving. During this time window one can expect
switching over aggregation pathways under magnetic field action like that
found in spin chemistry.
6.4.1 Spin-dependent Magnetic Field Effect in Eu^^ Clusters Being
Formed during Slow Aggregation in Crystal Lattice: "Bulk
Diffusion" Mode
NaCliEu (- 0.01%) crystals were used for studying the interplay between
dipole aggregation and magnetic properties of crystals. Since aggregation
is finished in aged crystals, thermal treatment was applied to initiate this
process. Exposure of crystals for two hours at 770 K dissolves all clusters
and produces separated dopant dipoles in the lattice. Rapid cooling of the
annealed crystals to room temperature (quenching) causes partial freezing
of high-temperature nonequilibrium state of dispersed ions and makes
possible the observation of relatively slow degradation of crystal properties
during growth of clusters at r = 293 K.
The SQUID magnetometer was used for measurements of magnetic
moment of crystal at different aggregation stages. We studied
comparatively short stages of aggregation. Average distance between
dissolved separated dipoles in freshly quenched crystals is about d- 100 A
at 0.01% concentration of Eu. Casual approaching of two dipoles takes
time t ~ d^lD ~ 10^-10^ s (~ 100 days) at the diffusion coefficient D ~
10"^^ m^ s"' typical for double valence dopant ions in NaCl crystals. The
duration of our experiments was about this time. For this reason MEU(T)T
dependence was approximated by two contributions: x\ separated dipoles
and X2 dimers of different configurations MEU = A^dip + Mdim. Dipole
contribution A/dip was described by the Brillouin function Bs{^):

where ^B is the Bohr magneton, g = 2 the "^-factor," ks the Bohzmann
constant, S = 7/2 the spin value of Eu"* ions,
g = -- and «s(g) = ^^coth(^^,)--coth(^j (2)
Dimer contribution A/dim must account for all possible spin states with
total spin S varied in the range from 0 to 5max = 25EU = 7'^^
where g = Sgii^Blk{T + To), parameter To characterizes average exchange
interaction in different dipoles. Approximation of experimental
dependencies by MEU{T)T= (Mdip(r) + Md\m(T))T function was obtained for
different times elapsed after quenching. Good coincidence of theoretical
curves with experimental data confirms the validity of the "dipole +
dimer" model and gives the time dependencies of dipole x\ and dimers X2
concentrations. In agreement with a simple prediction, the number of
dipoles decreases as dimer number grows. This indicates that SQUID
magnetometry is a convenient method for studying aggregation.
Initial and final states of this cluster must have different total spins.
In this case change in spin state of magnetosensitive clusters under a
magnetic field can be detected using the SQUID magnetometer. Since the
strongest sensitivity of clusters to MF is known to arise at about ~ 50 h
after quenching (Fig. 6-4-2), the sample was kept for two days at 300 K
after quenching. In these experiments we took into consideration the
absence of magnetic field effects in low field J? < 1 T at room temperature
and in magnetic field up to 20 T at low temperature, 7 < 77 K. We used
weak MF of SQUID magnetometer 0.3 T for testing of spin state and
strong MF 5 T to initiate cluster transformation. The dependence MEU(T)T
was recorded in a weak MF in the temperature range 2 - 200 K. Then the
crystal was slowly heated close to 300 K and kept for 40 min in the
magnetometer without any disturbance. After this procedure the crystal
was cooled to 2 K and dependence MEU(T)T was measured again. It was
necessary to check possible deviations of MEU that might occur due to
aggregation itself at high temperature. The heating of crystals itself does
not produce any changes in the MEn(T)T curve (Fig. 6-4-2). Exposure of
crystals in static MF B = 5 T at 300 K modifies the shape of the MEU(T)T
dependence recorded at low temperatures (Fig. 6-4-2). Similar changes
were found in each of the six samples used in our experiments. Observed

deviations of MEU(T)T dependence are due to the magnetic properties of
crystal changing under strong MF.
The Brillouin functions of dipoles (S = 7/2) and clusters with
maximal spin 5max (dimer spin Smax = 7, trimer spin 5niax = 21/2) are
presented in Fig. 6-4-2 by solid lines. The experimental curves are found
between two Brillouin functions of the dipoles (5 = 7/2) and the dimers.
Average spin approximation gives the average spin values determined
before MF application 5 = 6.2 ± 0.1 and after MF application 5 = 4.8 ± 0.1.
Thus, exposure of crystals in MF causes reduction of spin of
magnetosensitive clusters. Closeness of the experimentally determined
average spin S = 6.2 to its maximal value 5max = 7 in dimers identifies the
magnetosensitive cluster as a dimer (pair of the dipoles) having parallel
spins bound by exchange interaction. The discrepancy of measured spin
values from the theoretical 5max = 7 can be explained by the contribution of
free non-aggregated dipoles into the SQUID signal.
Another advantage of our experiments is the capability of dislocation
obstacles to be photoluminescent (PL) labels. The experimental conditions
established in this work allowed us to observe the effect of a "weak"
magnetic field on the PL of a small number of reliably identified centers,
which represent Eu^^ dipoles. Ultraviolet excitation of the Eu^^ ions

entering into the clusters of such centers initiates transitions from the 4f
shell to the 4f ^5d shell split in the crystal field into two tig and e^ sublevels
differing in symmetry.'^^ The radiative relaxation of excited ions proceeds
from the state of the eg symmetry with a high probability (~ 99%), whereas
the transition from the t2g state has a high probability of radiation-less
relaxation. Before the emission of optical quant the t2g -> eg transition must
occur. It gives a single emission band and two bands in excitation spectra
(Fig. 6-4-3). The relation between intensities of excitation bands S\/S2
characterizes the distribution between radiative and radiation-less
processes strongly dependent on intracrystalline field and atomic local
arrangement of Eu^^ ions.
In order to provide a way for clusters of various atomic configurations
to form, the samples after quenching were held for a certain time t (from
10 min to 100 hours) at room temperature in MF 15 T Quenched crystals
contain a single PL band including small cluster and separated dipole
contributions. Since we cannot distinguish these contributions in the
emission spectrum, the excitation spectrum was recorded several fimes
after quenching during exposure of the crystal in MF. Every time a crystal
was taken out from MF for excitation spectrum measurement. Exposure of
a crystal to a MF with ^ = 15 T at 7 = 293 K reduces the ratio of intensities
in the 5i and ^2 bands of the excitation spectrum recorded at 427 nm (Fig.
6-4-3). The MF effect on 5i/52 can be observed only in the samples that
were stored after quenching at room temperature for r > 50 h. This means
that bulk diffusion during -- 50 h leads to the formation of magnetosensitive
clusters.

6.4.2 Magnetic Field Influence on Eu^* Clusters Formed near
Dislocation Cores by Diffusion: "Fast Diffusion" Mode (dc/dt =

As the aged NaCl:Eu crystals were not subjected to any thermal treatment
for a long time, most doping ions were included in large-scale precipitates.
A composite structure of the emission PL spectrum was observed in
unquenched crystals (Fig. 6-4-4(a)). A regime of constant rate of stress
sweeping (da/dt = const) led to the redistribution of the emission intensity
between various regions of the PL spectrum and to the appearance of

additional bands at 536 nm and 600 nm reported in reference 15 (Fig. 6-4-
4(a)). Decomposition of averaged spectra on Gauss components reveals
that the contribution of the dipole and small clusters decreases after
deformation. The intensity of the band associated with (013) precipitates
slightly grows in the absence of MF. This means that dislocation
displacement causes clusterization of the dipoles and small clusters into
big ones. Since the deformation process takes -10-30 min we can
conclude that aggregation proceeds faster in comparison with the case of
bulk diffusion described in the previous section. As the acceleration of the
diffusion is usually provided by the increase in the mobility of doping ions
near the dislocation core, the described regime of plastic flow could be
called the "fast diffusion" mode.
As one can see from Fig. 6-4-4(b), deformation-stimulated
redistribution of the PL intensity is sensitive to magnetic field applied
during deformation. Decomposition of the spectrum into the Gauss
components reveals an increase of PL intensity in bands of free dipoles and
small clusters (at 427 nm) if deformation was performed under constant
MF B = 15 T. The luminescence band associated with (013) precipitates (at
485 nm) grows during deformation in a magnetic field more intensively in
comparison with zero MF deformation. This means that the MF promotes
generation of small clusters (at 427 nm) and (013) plane precipitates (at
485 nm) during deformation. The other bands, including the new ones at
536 and 599 nm, are not affected by the applied MF. Since the magnetic
field changed deformation in the regime of destruction of precipitates we
can assume that the "fast diffusion" mode was changed to the "cut off
mode described in the following section. Aggregation of the dipoles in
clusters during plastic flow was found by both SQUID magnetometer and
EPR spectrometer.
6.4.3 Magnetic Field Effects on Eu^* Clusters Generated by Moving
Dislocations: "Cut Off" Mode (de/dt = const)
A so-called "hard" deformation machine providing linearly increasing
deformation (de/dr = const) was used. Aged NaCl:Eu crystals were
unloaded between additional portions of deformation as in the previous
series to perform measurements of the PL spectrum. Comparative analysis
of the absolute values of changes in integral intensities of luminescence
bands during deformation allows one to conclude that processes taking
place under the deformation in the d£/dr = const regime can be divided into
two groups: (i) transformation of the three-dimensional EUCI3 precipitates
into emitting centers at A = 536 nm and (ii) transformation of the two-
dimensional plate-like EuClz precipitates into small-size clusters. Since the
destruction of large clusters into small ones predominates in this series of
experiments, it can be concluded that another mode of plastic flow exists.
This can be called the "cut off mode. After each deformation step on

6.4 From Spin Dynamics in Ionic Pairs to Softening of Crystals 289
1-2% crystal was subjected to the action of a pulsed magnetic field 6 T for
10 ms, the deformation and magnetic field treatment were performed
separately both to accumulate more magnetosensitive clusters and to
prevent artifacts from the action of magnetic field on metallic parts of the
factory-made deformation machine. Exposure of the deformed NaCliEu
crystals to the magnefic field leads to a redistribution of the emission
intensity between various components of the PL spectrum. Magnetosensitive
clusters have been formed during the "cut off' mode of the deformation. A
study of the variation of each separate component showed that the intensity
of emission at 427 nm decreases, while that of the band at 485 increases.
The other bands, including the new ones at 536 and 599 nm, were not
affected by the applied magnetic field. Luminescence of nondeformed
crystals was not sensitive to MF. Thus, plastic deformation in the "cut off
mode supplies a number of magnetosensitive clusters because big clusters
are destroyed by moving dislocations.
6.4.4 Spin-dependent Magnetic Field Effect on Plasticity of Crystals
at Different Modes of Magnetosensitive Cluster Formation
Let us summarize the described data from the viewpoint of clusterization
modes. Three different regimes of magnetosensitive cluster formation exist
(Fig. 6-4-5).
A. Bulk Diffusion Mode
The bulk diffusion mode can occur in the absence of dislocations and
plastic flow (Fig. 6-4-5(a)). In this regime free paramagnetic ions meet
each other and form magnetosensitive clusters in the bulk of crystal. As
shown above, the structure of the intermediate clusters can be changed by
MF due to modification of binding exchange energy caused by spin
transition in clusters. Plastic properties depend on the final atomic
configuration of the clusters because overcoming these clusters by
dislocations is very sensitive to lattice distortion (or power of the elastic
field produced by the clusters). Dislocation mobility serves as an indirect
measure of magneto-induced events proceeding to the crystal lattice. After
quenching of crystals there was a waiting period essential for the
accumulation of magnetosensitive clusters. Similar magnetoplastic effects
were found in ionic crystals containing other doping ions^^^ as well as in
metals'^^ and semiconductors.'^^
B. Cut Off Mode
This mode produces magnetosensitive clusters by destroying large
precipitates under dislocation elastic fields (Fig. 6-4-5(b)). In this case it is
not necessary to perform quenching of crystals, and magnetic field effects
could be observed in aged crystals both during plastic flow and after
deformation. Some of the magnetoplastic effects were found during

deformation of unquenched crystals.'^^^^ It was shown that recovering
magnetosensitivity of plastic flow after the first pulse of MF originates after
some delay necessary for deformation of crystal and accumulation of
magnetosensitive clusters.^^^ This fact is evidence that plastic deformation itself
produces magnetosensitive clusters.
C. Fast Diffusion Mode
This type of mode occurs near the dislocation core (Fig. 6-4-5(c)). It is
similar to the bulk diffusion mode. The main difference between them is
the diffusion coefficient that is a few orders of magnified higher in the
vicinity of the dislocation core than in the undistorted lattice. Since the
configuration of clusters lying near the dislocation core is more important
for dislocation mobility than that of clusters in the bulk, even a small part
of the clusters being transformed by MF could strongly contribute to the
plasticity. For observation of magnetoplasticity in this mode it is necessary

to have quenched crystals with dispersed impurity that are able to be
absorbed into the dislocation core.
It is well known that plastic flow can be discontinuous (or jump
like) (Fig. 6-4-6). This phenomenon, called the Portevin-Le Chatelier
(PLC) effect, is observed in NaCl:Eu crystals under definite range of
impurity concentrations. The effect is caused by dynamic strain aging,
associated with the formation of Cottrell impurity clouds around
dislocation cores. This process is accompanied by the clusterization of
individual impurity-vacancy dipoles (Fig. 6-4-6). The PLC effect in the
deformation machine linearly sweeping mechanical stress manifests itself
in the form of a stepped deformation curve. We observed notable change
in the discontinuous flow parameters under MR The presence of a MF
decreased the probability of the appearance of deformation jumps, caused
chaotization of the steps size ACT and decrease of depth in the deformation
jumps A£ of up to two times. Calculation of the probability density of the

Fig. 6-4-6 Height of as-quenched NaCl:Eu crystal during its deformation versus time (or linearly
growing stress o). This fragment of deformation curve presents two jumps of the PLC
effect. The lower part of the figure shows a schematic representation of interaction between
individual dislocation and impurity-vacancy Eu'^ dipoles, explaining the origin of steps on
the deformation curve. At the beginning, free dislocation moves and gathers dipoles in its
core. The velocity of dislocation is determined by the competition of two processes:
absorption of dipoles to the dislocation core and liberation of the dislocation from the
cluster cloud. When aggregation is very fast, dislocation stops due to cluster growth.
Increase of external linearly sweeping stress kicks out dislocation from clusters and allows
the deformation process to continue. (Clusters are much stronger obstacles for dislocation
movement than dipoles.) As the external stress sweeps linearly with time, one has to wait
when stress achieves the critical value needed for separation of dislocation from clusters.
This is the reason for the existence of horizontal segments on the deformation curve.

additive flows of events: movement of correlated ensembles of
dislocations and independent noise-like movement of dislocation groups of
various sizes. The probability densities obtained were approximated by the
sum of the Gauss function with amplitude A] and the decreasing function
A2/AE. The approximating curves precisely follow the experimental data,
both for the tests carried out in MF and for the reference tests (Fig. 6-4-7).
One can see that the MF decreases the contribution of the correlated
component of the dislocation motion and increases the noise-like
component.
The spatial heterogeneity of deformation often looks like steps or
shear bands on the specimen surface. Since the typical depth of

--- Page 309 ---

6.4 From Spin Dynamics in Ionic Pairs to Softening of Crystals 293
deformation jumps on deformation diagram registered in our tests was
-1-10 //m, one can expect these jumps to correspond to definite spatial
heterogeneity of deformation of similar scale. Observation of the surfaces
by optical microscope allowed us to find alternating zones of plastic
deformation with average width ~ 20 jum (inset. Fig. 6-4-7(a)). These
zones were parallel to the (001) direction and perpendicular to the load
axis. In crystals deformed in MF, decrease in the amount of pronounced
deformation zones was observed (compare insets of Figs. 7(a) and -7(b)).
A comparison shows that in crystals subjected to MF, the number of
deformation bands on the surface was on average one half that in crystals
not subjeced to MF.
PLC itself in the absence of MF arises as a result of the sweeping of
free dipoles and their capture in the dislocation core (Fig. 6-4-6). In the
dislocation core, diffusion provides fast clusterization of the dipoles into
clusters that are strong obstacles to dislocation motion. Thus, after a short
period of motion, the dislocation absorbs dipoles and clusters. Under the
action of thermal fluctuations dislocation can overcome formed clusters.
Liberation of dislocation from the cloud under the action of a magnetic
field leads to the partial destruction of clusters and to the continuation of
dislocation motion.
6.4.5 Conclusions
1. The initial stage of diffusion-controlled growth of Eu clusters inside
the NaCl crystal lattice is found to be spin-dependent and sensitive to
static and pulsed magnetic fields 5 = 5-15 T. Dimers (couple of
dipoles) of several atomic structures are formed and undergo thermo-
activated atomic transformation at this stage. Application of the
magnetic field leads to the reconstruction of dominant type dimers into
more favorable ones for subsequent growth of large clusters. Switching
over aggregation pathways under magnetic field at the beginning of
aggregation affects the final products of aggregation and stimulates
more rapid growth of 2D precipitates.
2. The reason for the rearrangement of Eu'^^ ions belonging to dimers is
alteration of the dimer spin state under magnetic field in thermo-
excited positions of atoms when the covalent bond between them is
stretched out and the spin transition is resonant in magnetic field.
Change in the spin-electronic ground term of the Eu^"^ pair from the
high-spin state to the low-spin state modifies part of the binding energy
due to exchange coupling and causes destabilization of the initial
atomic configuration of the dimer.
3. Magnetosensitive clusters can be formed in NaCliEu crystals in three
different ways: (a) slow thermo-activated aggregation of the dipoles in
the crystal lattice, (b) cut-off of big precipitates by gliding dislocations,
(c) fast aggregation of the dipoles in dislocation cores. This means that

--- Page 310 ---

294 6 Dynamic Spin Chemistry
different kinds of magnetoplastic effects have a uniform origin, i.e.,
dimer transformation. The experimental conditions of magnetoplastic
effect observation can vary depending on the microscopic mechanisms
of the magnetosensitive dimer formation.

Novel Magnetic Field Effects
Many examples of various MFEs whose broad mechanisms are
known are discussed in Chapters 2 through 6. However, there
are several MFEs whose mechanisms are not well understood at
present. For example, adsorption of gas to solid is significantly
affected by an external magnetic field of less than 1 T. The
effects cannot be explained by the mechanisms of MFEs
discussed in Chapter 1. The novel effects of magnetic fields are
important from both basic and applied points of view, since
understanding of the phenomena will open a new field of
magneto-science and the effects have the potential for further
applications in industry.
In this chapter, MFEs on adsorption of gas to solids,
optical properties of water, phase transition in diamagnetic
materials, photo-induced ultrafine particle formation and related
topics are described.
7,1 Magnetic Field Effects on Adsorption of Gas
Serious attention has focused on magnetic field effects on chemical
reactions. These have been reviewed extensively by Steiner and Ulrich.'^
On the other hand, there are not many reports on external magnetic field
effects on chemical processes in heterogeneous systems such as catalytic
reactions on solids.^'^^ Due to cage effects, interfaces should provide more
favorable conditions for magnetic field effects than three-dimensional bulk
phases. Turro and coworkers^^ reported the cage effects and magnetic field
effects on the photodecomposition of several dibenzyl derivertives
adsorbed on porous glass, silica gel and reversed-phase silica gel.
Solid surfaces generally having geometrical or energetic
heterogeneities which arise from defects, pores and variously indexed
surfaces, exert adsorption potentials on the adsorptives. Thus, a phase
adsorbed on such solid surfaces may be different from the bulk phase. An
example is changes in the magnetic property of adsorptives in adsorbing.
Paramagnetic nitrous oxide (NO) may form a diamagnetic condensed
phase on solids^^ at a much higher temperature than the boiling and critical

296 7 Novel Magnetic Field Effects
points of its bulk phase. The diamagnetic property was ascribed to the NO
dimer.^^ Paramagnetic O2 was also adsorbed as a diamagnetic O2 dimer in
zeolite micropores at low temperatures.^^
A typical magnetic interaction in inhomogeneous systems is the
magnetocatalytic para/ortho-hydrogen conversion on metals and metal
oxides.'^ It is believed that the magnetocatalytic ability arises from
paramagnetic interactions between adsorbates and solids, such as
paramagnetic centers on surfaces of diamagnetic oxides and ferro-
(ferri-)magnetic solids above the Curie temperature. The antiferromagnetic
oxides a-Cr203, CoO and MnO have been investigated with respect to their
magnetocatalytic properties around their Neel temperature (TN). The
chemisorption rate of NO over 5-FeOOH showed an anomaly at their
magnetic transition.^^ Selwood showed that during adsorption of molecules
onto metals magnetic susceptibility of the metals decreased.'^^
Under external magnetic fields, the catalytic activity of solid surfaces
for the para/ortho-hydrogen conversion showed a maximum at the TNI
depression in the paramagnetic region {T > T^) and promotion in the
antiferromagnetic region (7 < T^)?^ Ippommatsu and coworkers''^ found
that an increase in the conductivity of Sn02 thin film by applying a strong
magnetic field was observed when a H2-O2 reaction was proceeding on the
Sn02 surface in an oxygen atmosphere at 773 K. The rate of increase in the
conductivity (ca. 2.3% at 5 T) was proportional to the square of the
magnetic field intensity. They explained the magnetocatalytic H2-O2
reaction by changes in the frequency factor for Sn02 surface reactions of
H2 and adsorbed O2' by magnetic fields.
From these aspects, we may expect that physisorption as well as
chemisorption should be influenced by an external magnetic field as well
as the intrinsic magnetic field of solids (magnetisms of a bulk phase and
surface). NO has been used extensively as a probe molecule for the survey
of active sites on solid surfaces. Therefore, we first used NO for
investigation of external magnetic field effects on gas adsorption. The
adsorption of paramagnetic NO was affected by steady magnetic fields
even at room temperature.^ '^^ NO adsorption was enhanced on metal
oxides by magnetic fields besides FeOOH polymorphs from which NO
was desorbed.^^ On microporous materials, such as zeolites and activated
carbons, magnetic fields promoted NO micropore filling.'^^ Some causes
for magnetic field-induced adsorption and desorption (MAD), such as
magnetism, adsorption sites and porosity of solids, have been examined,
and some correlation was recognized between them, although the
mechanism of MAD is not understood yet.
NO was chemically as well as physically adsorbed at room
temperature. Therefore, the magnetoresponses of NO adsorption are very
complex because there are many possible NO speices on surfaces and in
pores which respond differently to magnetic fields. Thus, O2, which also is

--- Page 313 ---

7.1 Magnetic Field Effects on Adsorption of Gas 297
paramagnetic, was used for the approach to the mechanisms of magnetic
field effects on adsorption''^ because O2 is physically adsorbed at 77 K and
its adsorption state is relatively simple. Moreover, the magnetic properties
of adsorbed O2 have been well investigated. O2 is very interesting from
many points of view, one of which is the O2 separation from air. We will
show the possibility of air separation due to gradient'"' as well as steady
magnetic fields,"^ which can lead to the magnetic separation of other gas
mixtures.
Generally speaking, magnetic energies are trivial even compared with
thermal energy. Therefore, it is difficult to expect magnetoadsorption in
paramagnetic systems, much less in any diamagnetic system such as water,
besides ferromagnetic systems such as hydrogen absorption alloys, e.g.,
LaCo5H;c.'^^ There are reports concerning the properties of water on solid
surfaces and around solutes in aqueous solutions because water bound to
molecules and solids plays very important roles in the activities of solids
and the conformation of molecules, and also its own activity. It is well
known that hydrated or adsorbed water is different from bulk water in
structure and static and dynamic properties. If the magnetic properties of
water around substances change via interactions with the surfaces, some
phenomena via the changes may be expected. Magnetic effects on
adsorption seem to be one of the phenomena based on such magnetic
behavior. It was confirmed that diamagnetic water'^' and organics (benzene
and alcohols) were affected by external, steady magnetic fields of even less
than 1 T.
It is possible to affect gas adsorption if the magnetization of an
adsorptive and/or adsorbent changes during adsorption. When the
equilibrium pressure (p) of a water/solid adsorption system changes to p +
A/7 due to the application of a magnetic field (//) at T K, the change in the
free energy of the gas phase (per mole) is dGg = RT{\n(p + A/7) -\n p). On
the other hand, the magnetization change (AM) of the system due to the
adsorption of 1 mole of molecules (adsorptives) under H causes a change
in the magnetic free energy of the system, dGm = AM//. In an adsorption
equilibrium under a steady magnetic field, dGg + dGm = 0, and, thus, the
relation between A/7 and H may be given by'^'
RT{ ln(p + A/7) - In /7} = -AM// (1)
Under the experimental condition p > A/7, Eq. (2) becomes
Ap/ p = -AMH/ RT (2)
Here R is the gas constant. Eq. (2) demonstrates that whenever the
magnetization of the adsorption system changes in adsorbing, the
equilibrium pressure in the system should change, e.g., a positive AM can
cause decrease in pressure, i.e., magnetoadsorption.

7.1.1 Magnetic Field Effects on Adsorption
Magnetic effects on adsorption were investigated by pressure changes in
adsorption systems.^"''^ '"^ ^^^ The adsorption cell was an ESR tube and a
quartz cell with a stop-cock; this was connected to a vacuum line as the
adsorption system having a total volume of 50 ml or less.^ '^^ The
adsorption cell was kept at 303 K by circulating temperature-controlled
water or at 77 K by dipping in a liquid nitrogen whose level was kept
constant during O2 and N2 adsorption using an automatic supplier of liquid
nitrogen. H2 adsorption was measured with a cryostat in the range 20 to
303 K. The critical point of H2 is 33.0 K and 1.29 Pa. Pressure of the
adsorption system was measured by a Baratron sensor (sensitivity 0.001
Torr) and recorded by a personal computer at intervals of 2 s. Magnetic
fields were applied to the cell with an electric magnet (< 1 T) and a liquid
helium-free superconducting magnet (< 10 T).
Solid samples (< 200 mg) were pretreated at a proper temperature and
1 mPa for 2 h. A gas or vapor was introduced over adsorbents in the
adsorption cell at the temperature. After 30 min, a steady magnetic field
was applied to the sample; the pressure change was monitored with time.
Figure 7-1-1 summarizes the schematic patterns of the magnetoresponses
of pressure (p) as a function of time t. The equilibrium amount of MAD is
denoted by Av, which was calculated from the pressure change (Ap).

7.1 Magnetic Field Effects on Adsorption of Gas 299
A. Steady Magnetic Field Effects on Paramagnetic Gases
a. Nitrous oxide
Magnetic field effects on NO on iron oxides were observed at 303 K.^^
Ferrimagnetic magnetite and maghemite showed magnetoadsorption in the
external magnetic fields of 0.1-0.8 T. Hematite (parastic ferromagnetism)
also showed magnetoadsorptivity. Antiferromagnetic iron oxyhydroxides
(a-, p-, and y-FeOOH) showed magnetodesorption. On the other hand, an
antiferromagnetic NiO and a ferrimagnetic 5-FeOOH exhibited magnetoad-
and magnetodesorptivity, respectively. The magnetoadsorptivity of
magnetites depended on the pretreating conditions and that of 5-FeOOH
was independent of its magnetic susceptibility. The results suggest that
surface sites and porosity, i.e., adsorption state of NO, rather than solid
magnetism play an important role in the magnetic interactions between
solid surfaces and NO molecules under a magnetic field.
It is known that (N0)2 is formed at low temperatures or in the
condensed phase.^^ Usually, the adsorbed phase in micropores and
adsorbed multilayers are liquidlike, thus one may expect that NO on solids
exist as an (N0)2. In fact, Enault and Larher showed that NO is converted
to (NO)2 in the adsorbed layers on flat surface below 90 K.'^""^ In addition,
the magnetic susceptibility measurements showed that most NO molecules
in the micropores are dimerized even above room temperature by the
stabiUzation (ca. 10 kJ mol"') of (N0)2.^' The dimers seem to be stabilized
in 0.5- and 1.0-nm micropores which fit the size of the dimer (0.3 x
0.41 X 0.30 nm^). Since (N0)2 has a boiling point or behaves as a vapor,
(NO)2 formation in the micropores can lead to anomalous NO
physisorption even at room temperature. The NO dimer has a weak
chemical bond which arises from electron pairing between two NO (^11)
molecules, but the coupling between two interacting NO molecules will
still be weak and the unpaired electrons will be localized mainly on each
NO molecule.^^^^ The ground state of (NO)2 as a two-spin system is singlet
The micropore filling of a supercritical NO onto activated carbons
was enhanced by a steady magnetic field (< 1 T), e.g., 130 jUg g' at 1 T on
polyacrylonitril-based activated carbon fibers. This is referred to as
magnetomicropore filling.'^^ The magnetomicropore filling of pitch-based
activated carbon fiber occurred just after application of a magnetic field.
Cellulose- and polyacrylonitril-based activated carbon fibers, a coconut
shell-based activated carbon, and a molecular sieving carbon showed
markedly a transient magnetomicropore filling: rapid NO adsorption due to
a magnetic field and a subsequent, exponential decrease under the
magnetic field. The magnetomicropore filling relates closely to slitlike
micropores and acid sites. Micropores, especially, seem to be useful for
magnetically induced formation of an NO dimer, making micropore filling
of a supercritical NO easy. Fig. 7-1-2 demonstrates clearly that 0.5- and

b. Oxygen
O2 pressure in the Z5A and AlO systems decreased reversely by the
application of low magnetic fields.'*' This pressure decrease should be the
magnetoadsorption, since pressure changes in the adsorbent-free (only O2)
systems were at most a few percent of those in the adsorption systems.
Amounts of O2 adsorbed on AlO increased with increasing magnetic
field intensity below around 8 T, whereas it decreased over 8 T. The
magnetic field Hz (= 8 T) at which no magnetic effect was observed shifted
to a lower field with increasing relative pressure (Fig. 7-1-3(A)). In the Z5A
system, similar behavior was observed, although the //z value was slightly
smaller. The magnetoadsorption at around 3 T for A20 was more significant
than that for AlO. In the case of Y and NPC no magnetoadsorption was
observed below 10 T, i.e., only magnetodesorption was observed. Since the
pore width became larger in the order AlO, A20, Y and NPC (no pores),
the magnetoadsorption at least should arise from oxygen in micropores
(< 1 nm), which may form a certain domain. The most suitable state and/or
domain size of oxygen for the magnetoadsorption are also inferred from
the results that the magnetoadsorption of O2 on ACFs was greatest at the
relative pressure of p/po = 0.1.
O2 adsorbed on ACFs exist in different states, depending on O2
pressure and pore size. O2 adsorbed on AlO is a mixture of a two-
dimensional (paramagnetic) gas and nonmagnetic clusters (random
magnetism) in our experimental conditions (77 K and 250 Torr).'^' In the

O2 in the adsorbed phases.
B. Steady Magnetic Field Effects on Diamagnetic Gases
a. Nitrogen
A diamagnetic N2 was magnetically desorbed under all examined H
regions and adsorbents (NPC, A10 and Y) at 77 K, as shown in Fig. 7-1-
3(B). "^ The magnetodesorption was marked in smaller micropore systems.
b. Hydrogen
H2 changes from a vapor to a supercritical gas at 33.0 K, the critical
temperature (Ic) of H2. Generally speaking, it is difficult for supercritical
gases to be physically adsorbed on solid surfaces and pores. Thus the
adsorptivity of H2 must change near the critical point, reflecting solid-H2
interactions such as magnetization modification. The pressure of the AlO-
H2 adsorption equilibrium systems decreased with application of a 10-T
magnetic field. The magnetoadsorptivity of H2 onto various carbons
including a single wall carbon nanotube depends markedly on temperature,
as shown in Fig. 7-1-4(A). H2 vapor was adsorbed much more than the
supercritical gas by a magnetic field. In the vapor region, the pressure
change A/? depends on r~^ ^. On the other hand, in the supercritical region,
^p depends on (r - Tc)"^^ below 40 K and {T - Tc)~^-^^ in the range 40 -

micropores.

field. The H dependence of Ap is //^^' for the vapor (below Tc) and for the

Water in the first layer of hydrophilic oxide surfaces, such as y-FeOOH,

the first layer also responded slightly because the surfaces are partially
hydrophobic. 100 Av/v for NPC changed with v through a maximum or
minimum, depending on //, suggesting that water in a multilayer on
nonporous NPC seems to be less sensitive to magnetic fields. 100 Av/v for
A10 decreased stepwise along with increase in v, as shown in Fig. 7-1-

5(B). AlO has discrete, slitlike micropores of about 0.7 and 1.0 nm in
width, whose micropore capacity corresponds to 80 and 190 mg H2O g~\
respectively. Thus, the steps in the 100 Av/v - v plot for AlO seem to reflect
the difference in the response of micropore filling water in micropores
having a discrete size. Also, the steep drop in the Ap - p plot in Fig. 7-1-
5(A) is considered to arise from capillary condensed water in the
cylindrical mesopores of 7.0 nm in diameter of the chrysotile asbestos,
which should occur at around the p of 22 Torr. The lower pressure shift
under 10 T suggests that such high magnetic fields should induce certain
modifications of condensed water in the mesopores such as surface tension
and contact angle.
The magnetic energy of water seems to be too small, less than 1
cal/mol even under 1.0 T, to bring about such a large MAD, considering
that the energy for the physical adsorption of water is around 10 kcal
mol'. In addition, magnetoadsorption is not expected, because
diamagnetic water tends to be repelled from a magnetic field. From these
viewpoints, the magnetic properties of water (phase) could change through
an interaction with surfaces, as suggested by the trends in the ;fapp-//
relations of water adsorbed on SiO: and TiO: similar to their MAD
profiles.'"^^
The positive ;fapp of water adsorbed on SiO: beyond 0.45 T and the
lower diamagnetic water phase on TiO: than bulk water demonstrate that
Ap < 0 may be possible because of A/ > 0. On the other hand, the
magnetodesorption (Ap > 0) should be ascribed to more diamagnetic water
than bulk water from the viewpoint of Eq. (2). If Aj ~ ;t'app - ±10"' cm^ g~',
Eq. (2) gives Ap/p = ±(10-' ~ 10'^) in the range 0.1 - LOT, which is
comparable with the observed \Ap/p\, (0.3-5) x 10'\ A portion of the
adsorbed water phase should behave paramagnetically under static
magnetic fields via an interaction with the paramagnetic centers on the
surfaces, as indicated by the changes in the e.s.r. signals of the solids due
to water adsorption,

Methanol was adsorbed on NPC at 303 K by steady magnetic fields of less
than 0.7 T and desorbed over 0.8 T.'^^ The magnetic field dependence of
the MAD of methanol was quite opposite that of water, reflecting
structural difference in their adsorbed phase: a zigzag hydrogen-bond
chain for methanol and hydrogen-bond network for water. r-Butanol was
irreversibly or chemically adsorbed by magnetic fields.'^^ Benzene showed
high magnetoadsorptivity for NPC under magnetic fields of up to 1.2 T,'^^
suggesting the magnetic orientation of benzene molecules whose C2 axis
tends to be perpendicular to solid surfaces.
C. Thermodynamic Features in Magnetoadsorption
The thermodynamic consideration (Eq. (2)) presumes that the

magnetoresponses in pressure A/? should be proportional to the initial
pressure po, the inverse of temperaturer' (or r ^ depending on the
temperature dependence of Aj), and the square of magnetic field H^; or to
AM (or Ax) if the magnetization or magnetic susceptibility changes with a
magnetic field.
a. po Dependence of MAD
In general, the experimental A/? is denoted by
Ap = ki(p-pi) for/7, </?</7,>i(/ = l,2,3...) (3)
where kt is the magnetoresponse coefficient, which represents the
sensitivity for the magnetic response of pressure depending on //, and /?,
and Pi + 1 are the lower and upper threshold pressures, respectively, which
give the border of the pressure region (or the adsorption phase) having a
different magnetic response.
In adsorption systems where the interactions between a molecule and
solid surfaces and among molecules in the adsorbed phase are weak, Ap
was proportional to p. In a nonporous carbon black system, the Ap - p
relations for N2 and O2 at 77 K and H2O at 303 K were linear. In the
micropore systems, the relations for N: were linear in A10 as well as Y, but
for O2 was nonlinear even in Y. The Ap-p plot for H2O on A10 seemed to
comprise two or more linear regions. On the other hand, Ap in the systems
of chrysotile asbestos, MS5A and probably Si02 changed linearly with p
above a certain threshold pressure /?, of around 3-4 Torr.
i) Temperature dependence of MAD The ;fapp of the water phase
adsorbed on Si02 at 1.0 T above 225 K was proportional to T~\ In this
case, the temperature rise should reduce MAD according to Ap DC T'^. In
fact, the k2 value estimated gave a linear relation against T~^.
ii) H dependence of MAD In the magnetodesorption of N2 and
magnetoadsorption of O2 on NPC at 77 K, Ap changed linearly with H^
under constant p and T, whereas, since magnetic interaction becomes
significant among molecules in the adsorbed phase and between molecules
and solid surfaces, the H^-dependence of Ap disappeared. N2/AIO and
O2/Y systems showed H^ dependence, but O2/AIO systems did not because
the A10 system has smaller micropores than the Y system.
There seemed to be a variety of magnetically interacting systems in
which the magnetization changed during adsorption under magnetic fields:
Ax should be a function of H. In such adsorption systems, the H
dependence of the MAD of vapor and gas on various solids was classified
into four types, as summarized in Table 7-1-1: the magnetodesorption (I;
MD) and magnetoadsorption (II; MA) at all magneUc field intensities
employed; and the magnetodesorption-to-magnetoadsorption (III; MD-A)
and the magnetoadsorption-to-magnetodesorption transition with the
magnetic field (IV; MA-D).

b. Quantum Mechanical Aspects of MAD
The thermodynamic aspect seems to be useful for some qualitative
understanding of MAD. Notwithstanding, it should be pointed out here
that some characteristics of MAD seem to be similar to those of the
magnetocatalytic effects, which were interpreted by quantum theory.
There seem to be some similarities to the magnetocatalytic
photoreactions of dibenzoyl peroxide (the singlet/triplet {SIT) transition of
a radical pair^^^) and the magnetocatalytic ortho/para hydrogen conversion
on paramagnetic as well as diamagnetic solids under magnetic fields.^^
The mechanism for both cases is quite analogous to each other, and an H
dependence similar to the four types in Table 7-1-1 has been reported both
experimentally and theoretically.
The olp conversion process of H2 can be explained by the inhomogeneous
magnetic field of the paramagnetic center, which exerts different influences on
the two spins of the H2 molecule during a collision, as shown by the Wigner
theory.'^^ The magnetocatalytic activity of metal oxides may be classified
into three types with respect to its magnetic field dependence, which seems
to be quite similar to that of the four MAD types.~^ The absolute rate
constants of the olp hydrogen conversion on paramagnetic oxides followed

--- Page 322 ---

306 7 Novel Magnetic Field Effects
a proportionality to the square of the effective magnetic moment, as
predicted by the Wigner theory, whereas a consistent and quantitative
theoretical explanation for the magnetocatalytic effect under magnetic
fields is not so far available, although some other theories are partially
successful.^^^
The NO dimer and O: dimer may be regarded as a radical pair
system. Since the paramagnetic NO molecules adsorbed on NPC at room
temperature did not respond to the magnetic field, magnetic adsorption
seems to occur via the formation of a diamagnetic NO dimer having a
radical pair in the micropores. Since the magnetic adsorption increased
monotonically with increasing magnetic field intensity, the so-called Ag
mechanism seems to be plausible: Different magnetic fields at the two-spin
sites due to magnetically inhomogeneous surfaces and/or different g
factors may lead to an S/TQ transition under applied magnetic field. As in
radical pair reactions, the S/To transition due to magnetic fields may lead to
NO adsorption. In the case of the Z5A/O2 system, Zeeman stabilization of
singlet O4 may contribute to the magnetoadsorption, if a stabilizing energy
due to the electric field of Ca~^ for O4 adsorbed on Ca*^^ sites in micropores
become comparable with the Zeeman energy.'^' Therefore, the MAD of O2
should arise from magnetic stability associated with magnetization
changes due to adsorption. The rotational behavior of H2O seems to
closely resemble that of H2, if a water molecule is bound with its oxygen to
solid surfaces, in which each water molecule has in practice only one
rotational degree of freedom left.
7.1.2 Local Magnetic Field Gradient Effects on O2 Adsorption
The magnetic effect on the adsorption equilibrium should be accompanied
by changes in the magnetization of adsorptives and/or solids while
adsorbing under a steady magnetic field, according to Eq. (2). On the other
hand, even when the magnetization of an adsorption system remains
unchanged, a magnetic effect on adsorption may kinetically occur if a local
magnetic field is produced around and/or in solids by applying a steady
magnetic field. When a molecule having the magnedc susceptibility X\^
which is at the distance / from the entrance of a cylindrical pore and on the
center axis of the pore having radius /p, stands under a magnetic field
gradient Hr(l), the force y; is exerted on a molecule interacting with solids in
proportion to a gradient of the total potential energy which the molecule
feels. As an example, consider //r(/) produced by the perfect diamagnetism
of a spherical superconductor particle (radius: Rs) in contact with the
entrance of the pore. In this case, when an external magnetic field Ho is
applied to the mixture system comprising the superconductor and the
adsorbent, the molecule feels the following magnetic field at the position /:
//.(/) = -//o{l + /?sV2(/ + /?s)-M (4)

--- Page 323 ---

7.1 Magnetic Field Effects on Adsorption of Gas 307
After a simple calculation, we can obtain the force exerted on the molecule
at the pore entrance (/ = 0)
/(0) = -3;f,//o-/R + ;rp£(r*Vrp^-r*'V6rp'^) (5)
where e is the depth of the potential well at the potential minimum and r*
is the distance between a molecule and an atom in the solid at the potential
minimum.^^^ In Eq. (5), if the second term on the right side is negligible, a
paramagnetic molecule {x\ > 0) ^t the pore entrance should be expelled by
a magnetic force.
O2 pressure decrease (A^A) in the Z5A and A10 systems was brought
about by magnetic fields lower than 7 T, as described in section 7.1.1A2
above. Mixing YBa2Cu30v with both Z5A and activated carbon fibers led
to an increase in oxygen pressure (A/7A/SC) by applying magnetic fields of
less than 10 T (Fig. 7-l-6(A)).'"^ The oxide superconductor itself showed
no detectable pressure change due to magnetic fields. Therefore, the oxide
superconductor must indirectly promote the O2 desorption by AA/7A/SC (=
A/7A/SC - A/7A) from Z5A and A10 by the application of magnetic fields of
uptoca. 8T(Fig. 7-l-6(B)).
In the high Tc superconductors, the upper critical field Hd will be
indefinite because of large superconductive fluctuation, and instead the
vortex glass-to-liquid phase transition (//t ; //, < Hd) appears in the mixed
state. From the magnetization measurements, //t of our YBa2Cu30v at 77 K
seemed to exist at around 8 - 10 T, and x^cHd^ ^^^ maximum at around
1.5 T. Thus, it is inferred that the magnetodesorption of O2 from Z5A and
A10 due to coexistence of YBa2Cu30v should be brought about by the
perfect diamagnetism of the superconductor. According to Eq. (5), the
local magnetic field gradient in micropores tends to transport a
paramagnetic low-dimensional gas toward the exterior along micropores.

A rough estimation for a cylindrical micropore of a radius rp suggests that
oxygen molecules at the entrance of a micropore having a diameter of
around 0.52 nm should be free from the adsorption potential by a magnetic
force under lOT.
7.1.3 Future Problems
A. Gas Separation Due to Static Magnetic Fields
In microporous materials such as zeolites and activated carbons, MAD
depended strongly on the kind of solids and gases and magnetic field
intensity. Thus, a proper combination of them may lead to selective
adsorption from a mixed gas and more critically to gas separation. For
example, the separation of O2 and N2 due to high steady magnetic fields
seems to be plausible, as seen in Fig. 7-1-3. For this purpose, it will be
useful to apply a column system, adsorbent mixtures referring to Table 7-
1-1, and a magnetic field swing system.
B. Magneto-photoadsorption
The photodesorption of water on TiO: with UV irradiation appeared only
under magnetic fields, which was enhanced with increasing a magnetic
field of up to 1 T.^'^ On the contrary, the photoadsorption of water on ZnO,
which occurred at zero magnetic field, was almost unchanged with a
magnetic field. These examples demonstrate that magnetic fields may
affect the photoexcitation of electronic states of these n-type
semiconductors in a different manner. Thus, the photodecomposition of
water on a Pt-deposited TiO: may also be magnetically controlled.
Magnetic fields will affect such heterogeneous photocatalytic processes to
lead to novel compounds.
C. Electron Spin Resonance Adsorption
The pressure decrease of water vapor equilibrated with a zinc oxide and
silica was observed only during the paramagnetic resonance of the solids
adsorbing water. This may be referred to the electron spin resonance
adsorption (ESR adsorption).''* The ESR adsorption of water was
detectable with irradiation of a low power microwave. On the contrary, the
desorption of water occurred at higher microwave power probably because
of a thermal effect. The phenomenon is the first example of the magnetic
control of surface/molecule interactions during electron spin excitation.
7.1.4 Conclusion
We have experimentally confirmed the magnetic field-induced adsorption
and desorption (magnetoadsorption and magnetodesorption: MAD) of
various gases and vapors on many kinds of solids. MAD may be
thermodynamically interpreted, but it was only qualitatively and partially
successful. A well-designed magnetic field gradient also was able to

--- Page 325 ---

7.1 Magnetic Field Effects on Adsorption of Gas 309
dynamically control adsorption. Practically, this method will be more
useful than the thermodynamical control of adsorption due to a
homogeneous, steady magnetic field. The magnetic field control of
adsorption processes may give rise to the possibility of a gas separation
method, such as air separation and desulfuration. The magnetic treatment
of spin excitation and photoelectrons in solids will lead to new
heterogeneous reactions and novel compounds.

7.2 Magnetic Field Effect on Optical Properties of Water and
Aqueous Electrolyte Solutions
Water, essential for life on Earth, has many peculiar properties, including
large heat of vaporization, high boiling and melting temperatures, and high
solubility for charged and polar molecules J ^ The distinctive features of
liquid water are mainly due to its three-dimensional hydrogen bonding
network. Recent works on water have been extended to dynamical
structure studied by ultra-fast laser techniques," ^^ theoretical studies,"^'^^
and the relaxation dynamics of the interfacial water near the protein
surface based on neutron scattering.^' Other recent topics are collected in
the literature.^^
While a wealth of studies on water and solutions by light absorption
and scattering experiments have been reported, we focus here on the
refractive index of water. Recently, several convenient commercial sensing
devices based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) have been
developed.^^^^ These devices can determine the refractive indices of liquid
samples with very high sensitivity (An/n < 10"^). Recent development of
the SPR sensor and its application, especially to the chemical and
biological sensor, is reviewed by Homola et al.^' It is also promising and
important for the applications to study the basic properties of water itself
using this sensitive device. In this section, the effect of high magnetic
fields on the refractive indices of water and several aqueous electrolyte
solutions is studied in order to obtain insight into the static structure of
water.
7.2.1 Sensitive Measurement of the Refractive Index under High
Magnetic Fields
The refractive index (n) of water was measured by two methods, SPR and
PSD, shown in Fig. 7-2-1 (not to scale), as a function of the magnetic field.
All the measurements were carried out at ambient pressure and
temperature of 25.0°C stabilized within ±VC. The refractive indices of
aqueous electrolyte solutions were measured by the SPR method.
Figure 7-2-l(a) shows a setup using an SPR sensor (Spreeta™

PTSPR1A170100, Texas Instruments Inc.) which is based on the
resonance between the evanescent wave and the surface plasmon.'"^*^' The
sensor consists of a light emitting diode (AlGaAs, 840 nm) a molded
epoxy waveguide, a sensing area (50 nm gold film) and a photodiode array.
The resolution of the refractive index is 5 x 10"^. Due to the rapid damping
of the evanescent wave, this device is sensitive to the thin layer of the
analyte material at the vicinity of the interface. Typical thickness is 400 nm
for the water-gold interface.^"^ A recommended calibration procedure was
carried out by which the refractive index of ultrapure water at 25.0°C was
adjusted to 1.333000. The literature value of the refractive index of water
at 840 nm and 25.0°C is 1.32796'"^^ so the refractive index measured by the
SPR method in this study exhibits a slight constant difference from the
literature. This difference, however, should not affect our considerations
and conclusions. The sensor was placed at the magnetic center of a
superconducting magnet (JMT-10T150, Japan Super Conductor
Technology Inc.), which generates magnetic fields of up to 10 T. The
sensor was positioned so the gold film was perpendicular to the magnetic
field.
Another setup using a He-Ne laser (633 nm) and a position sensitive
detector (PSD) obtained from Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. was used as is
shown in Fig. 7-2-1(b) in order to measure the refractive index of bulk
water and elucidate any surface effects for the SPR measurement. A quartz
sample cell with a dimension of 12.5 x 12.5 x 45.0 (mm"^) including the
quartz wall thickness of 1.25 mm was placed at the magnetic center with a
tilting angle (0) between the cell and the laser beam. The laser beam

passing through the cell is deflected, and the displacement of the optical
path is detected by the PSD. The refractive index of water is obtained from
the displacement, 0, and the refractive index of water at 633 nm;
1.33158.'^^ The small difference in the optical path due to the quartz cell
itself is also taken into account. By varying the tilting angle 6 (70, 73, 75,
and 77 degrees), the consistency of the refractive index obtained was
checked and the experimental error {An/n) was estimated to be < 1.5 x
10 ^
Ultrapure water was prepared by a commercial water purification
system (Direct-Q 5, Millipore Corp., 18.2 MQ cm). NaCl and NiCh (Wako
Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. GR grade) were used without further
purification. The refractive index of «-hexane (Wako Pure Chemical
Industries, Ltd. 99.5%) was also measured without further purification.
7.2.2 Slight Optical Responses of Water to High Magnetic Fields
The dependence of the refractive index of pure water on the magnetic flux
density (B) is shown in Fig. 7-2-2. The refractive indices measured by the
SPR setup (triangles, «SPR) and the PSD setup (circles, ^PSD) show increases
by L8 X 10"' (0.14%) and 1.3 x 10' (0.09%) at 10 T, respectively, from
those measured in the absence of the magnetic field. The increase in AZSPR is
slightly larger than that in AZPSD. The origin of this discrepancy is unclear at
this time, although this may be attributed to the magnetic effect on water at
the vicinity of the interface or to the difference in the dielectric constant
between the wavelengths of 840 nm (SPR) and 633 nm (PSD). The
temperature derivative of the refractive index of water is ~1 x 10"^ deg"' at
room temperature in the visible region around 600 nm.'"^' In the current
study, the increase in MSPR and npso at 10 T exceeds the temperature
fluctuation effects. Thus, the refractive indices of both the vicinity of the
interface and the bulk are increased by the magnetic field effect.
A possible explanation for the increase in the refractive index of
water is that the hydrogen bond is stabilized under a magnetic field. From
a classical electromagnetic point of view, diamagnetism is explained by the
anti-parallel magnetization of a molecule to the external magnetic field by
electromagnetic induction. It is well known that Pauling explained the
diamagnetism of aromatic hydrocarbons by a molecular-size ring current
model. ^^^ Since the diamagnetism of a molecule depends on the extent of
electron distribution, the electron delocalization of hydrogen-bonded
molecules should increase its paramagnetism. Interactions between
material and magnetic fields are described by magnetic susceptibility (jc)-
Temperature dependence of j of water is relatively large compared to other
materials and is related to the degree of hydrogen bond formation.'^ '^^
Water's x is expressed by the sum of the diamagnetic and paramagnetic
terms: ^ = Xd + XP- Here, Xd originates in the closed-shell electric structure
of the molecule. On the other hand, XP is attributed to the deformed

experimental temperature dependence of the ratio of the mass
susceptibility to the one at 20°C is expressed by x^lx^^'c = 1 + 1.38810 x
10"^ {t - 20) + (higher order terms) for t in °C.'^^ This indicates that water
becomes more paramagnetic at lower temperatures. Therefore, water
molecules with hydrogen bonds should become more stable under a
magnetic field. Iwasaka et al.'''^ found that the frequency of the higher
harmonic vibrations of water shifts toward the longer wavelength under 14
T. In comparison to the spectra of water at higher pressures, they suggested
the enhancement of the hydrogen bond under high magnetic fields. The
enhancement of the hydrogen bond strength should lead to a change in the
electronic absorption, which affects the refractive index in the near
infrared region. According to the electronic spectra of ice in the vacuum
ultraviolet region,'^^ it was observed that the absorption of the first
electronic excited state of crystalline hexagonal ice is larger than that of
amorphous ice. The increase in the absorption due to the formation of
hydrogen bonds should cause the increase in the refractive index via the
Kramers-Kronig relation. The present observation strongly indicates that
the lifetime of hydrogen bonds is prolonged.
7.2.3 Comparison with a Nonhydrogen-bonded Liquid
In Fig. 7-2-3, the refractive index of A?-hexane (^hexane) is plotted against B
(circles) measured by the SPR method. The result for pure water (nwater) by
the SPR method is reproduced for clarity (triangles). While ^water gradually
increases with B, nhexane does not change up to 10 T. This difference

supports the hypothesis that hydrogen bonds are stabihzed under magnetic
fields. Moreover, the refractive index of ethanol under a magnetic field
(unpublished data) was measured and showed little dependence on B. This
may mean that although ethanol forms hydrogen bonds, they are not
stabilized significantly under magnetic fields since the number of
hydrogen bonds per molecule for ethanol is smaller than that for water.
7.2.4 Magnetic Responses of Hydrated Water of Magnetic and
Nonmagnetic Ions
Figure 7-2-4 shows the dependences of the refractive indices of aqueous
electrolyte solutions on B as measured by the SPR method. Each mark
represents the following electrolyte solutions: NaCl solutions at
concentrations of 5.0 M (open squares) and 0.50 M (open circles), and
NiCl2 solutions at concentrations of 2.5 M (closed squares) and 0.40 M
(closed circles). The refractive index of pure water (Aiwaier) is again
reproduced for clarity (triangles). The figure indicates that (1) the
refractive indices of electrolyte solutions increase with increase in
concentration in the absence of a magnetic field, and (2) the slope of the n-
B curves is positive at lower concentrations and negative at higher ones.
Without the magnetic field, the variation in the refractive indices of
electrolyte solutions compared with that of pure water increases in the
sequence 0.50 M NaCl (0.009) < 0.40 M NiCb (0.011) < 5.0 M NaCl
(0.034) < 2.5 M NiCh (0.035). It is intriguing that the increase in the
refractive index is dominated by [CI] at higher concentrations. The color
of the aqueous NiCh solution is green due to the formation of

[Ni(H20)6]^'^,^^^ and therefore its refractive index is expected to be
dependent on [Ni^^] due to the Kramers-Kronig relation. The results,
however, show that the refractive index depends more strongly on [CI]
than on [Ni^^] and [Na^] at higher concentrations. The solutions of 2.5 M
NiCl2 and 5.0 M NaCl are near saturation; NaCl/aq; 5.6 M, NiClz/aq; 6.0
M. At this concentration, the solution is dominated by ionic atmospheres
and the extent of ion-pair formation becomes large.~^^' The refractive index
at 840 nm seems to correlate to Cr, possibly due to the change or the
appearance of the electronic states of Cr perturbed by ion-pair formation
or complexation with cations. It should be noted that in the case of a
concentrated NiCl2 solution, the formation of [Ni(H20)5Cl]^ is reported.^'^
The changes in the refractive indices of the solutions at 10 T from

those without the magnetic field are -0.0006 (2.5 M NiCb), -0.0010 (5.0
M NaCl), 0.0016 (0.40 M NiCh) and 0.0014 (0.50 M NaCl), respectively,
as shown in Fig. 7-2-4. The slope of the n-B curves of these electrolyte
solutions also seems to be dependent more on [CI] than on [Na"^] or [Ni^""]
at higher concentrations. Although the paramagnetism of Ni^^ due to
unpaired 3d electrons is important, the refractive index under 10 T shows
little difference between the paramagnetic species (Ni^^) and the
diamagnetic species (Na^). Therefore, the n-B curves obtained should
originate in Cr.
Although the complex magneto-optical behavior of electrolyte
solutions cannot be explained easily, we can presume that two species bear
different n-B curves, e.g., the one dominant at higher concentrations and
the other at lower concentrations. Possible candidates for the higher
concentrations are a hydrate complex or an ion pair containing more than
one chloride ion, since the absolute value of n and the negative dependence
of A2 on ^ is dominated by [CI] at higher concentrations for both NiCh and
NaCl solutions. In addition, there are no distinct differences between the
two cations. The origin of the n-B curve at lower concentrations should be
water itself. According to the three-zone model by Frank and Wen,^^^ ions
hydrated by water (A zone) are further surrounded by a weakly interacting
"destructured" region (B zone) where water molecules are neither oriented
to the core ion nor hydrogen-bonded to each other. Around them is bulk
water (C zone) in which water molecules are structured by hydrogen
bonds. Thus, the n-B curve at lower concentrations is considered to be the
one for bulk water (C zone) superimposed by another for the ionic species
(A or B zone). For the saturated solutions, the n-B curve should be purely
dominated by the hydrated ions or the ion pairs.
The refractive index of aqueous NaCl («Naci) solution is plotted
against its concentrations (cNaci) with (circles) and without (squares) the
magnetic field of 10 T in Fig. 7-2-5, as measured by the SPR method. The
nwaci increases rapidly up to -0.5 M, above which it increases linearly in
both the absence and presence of the magnetic field. The AiNaci - CNaci
curves at 0 T and 10 T cross at 0.75 M (see inset to Fig. 7-2-5). The figure
clearly shows the occurrence of the trade-off between the two bearers of
the different magneto-optical behaviors at concentrations of 0.5-0.75 M.
Recently, the Cotton-Mouton (C-M) effect, i.e., a magneto-opfical
anisotropy between the axes along and perpendicular to the magnetic
fields, was measured for water and aqueous electrolyte solutions.^^^ The
authors of the report confirmed the small C-M effect of pure water under
13 T that arises from the anisotropics of the molecular polarizability and
the molecular magnetizability of water. This partly explains the increase in
the refractive index of water, although the C-M measurement shows only
the difference in the components of the refractive index. As for electrolyte
solutions, the specific C-M constant for NaCl in the aqueous solution is

six-fold larger than that for KCl, and the sign is opposite. These two
cations are closed-shell atomic ions and should not have any intrinsic
anisotropic polarizability and magnetizability. The unique difference
between Na^ and K"^ is the hydrate dynamics in aqueous phase. It is well
known that K^ and Na^ are termed a structure-making cation and a
structure-breaking cation, respectively, according to the Frank and Wen
model.^^^ They attributed the difference of the C-M effect between Na^ and
K^ to the hydration structure surrounding the cations. Their idea of the
magnetism of aqueous electrolyte solution affected by the structure of
hydrated water supports the current discussion.
7.2.5 Summary of Recent Magneto-optical Effect Studies on Aqueous
Systems
The refractive indices of water and aqueous electrolyte solutions were
measured. The refractive index of pure water under 10 T increases by
-0.1% more than that of pure water under zero magnetic field. It is
proposed that the hydrogen bond of water is stabilized under a magnetic
field. Therefore, the optical properties of the ultraviolet absorption and the
refractive index should increase. Aqueous electrolyte solutions at higher
concentrations show decrease in the refractive index under 10 T, which
may possibly be explained by the formation of a hydrate complex or an ion
pair containing more than one chloride ion.

7.3 Magnetic Field Effects on Phase Transitions in Diamagnetic
Materials
Magnetic field effect on thermodynamic properties at room temperature
was reported by Yamaguchi et al. for the change in the equiUbrium vapor
pressure in metal-hydrogen systems/^^ In this case, the magnetic effect
was explained by adding the magnetic term in the chemical potential of the
system. However, there has been almost no report on magnetic effects on
the phase transitions of diamagnetic materials. Since the magnetic energy
at 10 T, for example, is still weaker than the thermal energy at room
temperature and the magnetic effects on the phase transitions of
diamagnetic materials are expected to be very small, a highly sensitive
apparatus under a strong magnetic field must be used in order to detect the
magnetic effects on the phase transitions of diamagnetic materials.

7.3 Magnetic Field Effects on Phase Transitions in Diamagnetic Materials 319
For this purpose, a high resolution and super-sensitive thermal
apparatus was developed. A high resolution and super-sensitive differential
scanning calorimeter (DSC) working between 120 and 420 K capable of
measuring heat as small as on the order of 20 nW with temperature
resolution of less than 1 mK has been used to study the magnetic effects on
the phase transitions of diamagnetic materials/^^^ The schematic drawing
of the DSC is shown in Fig. 7-3-1."^^^ The calorimeter was set in a
magnetic bore 100 mm in diameter and was cooled by a refrigerating head,
A, which was connected to the calorimeter through copper plates, D. The
temperature difference between the test sample and the reference material,
produced by the heat absorbed in or released from the sample, was
measured by thermoelectric modules, which were made of 18
semiconducting thermoelectric elements connected in a series. The output
voltage of the thermoelectric module was about 7.8 mV K"', being about
200 times larger than the conventional thermocouple. The baseline of this

DSC was about two orders of magnitude more stable than that of a
commercial DSC. The temperature of the sample was measured using a Pt
resistance thermometer, TSi. Before measuring the magnetic effect on the
phase transitions of diamagnetic materials, the magnetic effect on the Pt
thermometer due to the magneto-resistance was measured.^ ^^ The DSC
was kept at room temperature without using a temperature control and a
magnetic field of 5 T was applied three times to measure the magnetic
effect on the Pt thermometer, TSi. The magnetic effect on the Pt
thermometer shifted reproducibly was as large as 18.2 mK at 288.65 K.
The temperature dependence of the magnetic effect on TSi was also
measured by controlling the temperature to be constant using the
thermometer, TS4, shown in Fig. 7-3-1, and the magnetic effect on TSi was
determined. It decreased with increase in the temperature. The temperature
shift of TSi due to the magnetic field was corrected to obtain the magnetic
effects on the phase transitions of diamagnetic materials hereafter.
7.3.1 Magnetic Field Effect on the Melting Transition of H2O and D2O
The first example of the magnetic effect on the phase transitions of
diamagnetic materials is the melting transition of H2O and D20.^^ Purified
H2O and D2O samples of 7.40 and 1.97 mg, respectively, together with
quartz powder of about 7 mg were hermetically sealed in an aluminum pan
for the DSC measurement. Quartz powder was used with water to make
the crystallization of water easier and the measurement reproducible. The
D2O sample mixed with quartz powder was analyzed by a mass
spectrometer and found to include about 19% of HDO. The inclusion of
HDO in the D2O sample may be due to light water adsorbed on the surface
of the quartz powder. Heat flux measurements on the melting transition of
H2O were conducted three times at a heating rate of 1 mKs' using the
DSC.^^ The results of two repeated measurements are shown in Fig. 7-3-2,
indicating almost the same results. The reproducibility of the three repeated
measurements was ±0.5 mK for the melting temperature. In the cooling
run, however, the solidifying temperature was not reproducible due to a
large super-cooling effect. The heat flux measurements on the melting
transition of H2O under a magnetic field of 6 T were made three times at a
heating rate of 1 mKs~^ The DSC curve of the melting transition at 6 T
was obtained in a manner similar to that shown in Fig. 7-3-2 within the
imprecision of ±0.5 mK except for a small temperature shift of the melting
temperature. Since the shift of the transitional peak due to the magnetic
field was slightly dependent on the peak position, the temperature shift
was averaged over the entire range of the transitional peak. The averaged
melting temperature with the magnetic field of 6 T was 5.6 ± 0.7 mK
higher than that without the magnetic field. The higher melting
temperature obtained under the magnetic field shows that the solid phase
becomes relatively stable compared with the liquid phase by the magnetic

field. Similarly, the shift in the melting temperature due to the magnetic
field was measured by changing the magnetic field. The shift in the
melting temperature of H2O due to the magnetic field was found to be 4.3
± 0.8 mK at 5 T and 3.2 ± 0.8 mK at 4 T. The shift in the melting
temperature of H2O is plotted against the square of the magnetic field as
shown in Fig. 7-3-3, where a linear relationship between the shift in the
melting temperature and the square of the magnetic field is seen. The heat
flux measurements on the melting transition of D2O with and without the
magnetic field were also made three times at a heating rate of 1 mKs"^ The
repeated measurements showed almost the same results. The DSC curve
showed two endothermic peaks around 277.34 and around 277.04 K due to
the melting transition of D2O and HDO, respectively. Similarly, as in the
case of H2O, the melting transition of D2O and HDO shifted to the high
temperature side by the application of the magnetic field. The shift in the
melting temperature of D2O due to a magnetic field of 6 T was found to be
21.9 ± 0.7 mK using the temperature range after the peak, because a
temperature lower than 277.34 K includes the effect of melting of HDO.
The shift in the melting temperature of HDO due to the magnetic field of 6
T was 17.3 ± 0.8 mK using the temperature range before the peak. The
shift in the melting temperature of D2O and HDO due to the magnetic field
was measured by changing the magnetic field. The shift in the melting
temperature of D2O due to the magnetic field was obtained to be 16.9 ± 1.0
mK at 5 T and 9.6 ± 1.4 mK at 4 T. The shift in the melting temperature of
HDO due to the magnetic field was obtained to be 13.9 ± 1.1 mK at 5 T
and 7.0 ± 1.2 mK at 4 T. The shift in the melting temperature of D2O and
HDO plotted against the square of the magnetic field also showed a linear
relationship.

materials can be discussed on the basis of a simple extension of the
Clapeyron equation.^^^ When we consider a diamagnetic substance at
temperatures near the phase transition, which has an angle 6 with respect
to the magnetic field, the molar Gibbs energy change dG including the
magnetic effect is represented by the following equation:
dG = -5dr-(^/^o)(Zisin-^ + ;^HCOs'0)d^ (1)
where S is the molar entropy, Xi. and X\\ are the diamagnetic susceptibility
perpendicular and parallel to the molecular axis, respectively, and B is the
magnetic flux. Since x± and X\\ are both negative values, the second term of
Eq. (1) becomes positive and then the system becomes unstable by
applying the magnetic field. When the phase transition is under way, the
molar Gibbs energy at the high temperature phase is equal to the low
temperature phase to give dGh = dGi, where subscripts h and 1 mean the
high temperature and the low temperature phase, respectively. Then the
shift in the transition temperature by the application of the magnetic field,
AT, becomes, by integrating the differential of Eq. (1),
AT = -{B^ 12jUo){;fi.h sin' ^h -Zii sin' 0\ + X^^-^ cos' 0h -
(2)
;fn..cos2^.}/(5h-S,)
Here we consider the melting transition of H2O as an example. Since the
diamagnetic susceptibility of ice is -8.11 x 10"^ along the c axis and -8.07
X 10"^ along the a axis according to Lonsdale,^^ the diamagnetic
susceptibility of ice can be regarded to be isotropic as an approximation.
Since liquid water is also isotropic, x^ is equal to X\\ (= X) t^o^h in the solid
and the liquid phases. Then AT for H2O and D2O becomes
Ar = (^2/2/io)ai-Zh)/(5h-5,) (3)

--- Page 339 ---

7.3 Magnetic Field Effects on Phase Transitions in Diamagnetic Materials 323
Using the value for the diamagnetic susceptibility of H2O ice, -8.09 x
10"^, taken as the average value along the a axis and c axis reported by
Lonsdale^^ and for liquid H2O, -9.05 x 10"^, from the results at 274.15 K
by Auer,^^ and the entropy change for the melting of H2O ice: 5h - 5i =
22.00 J K"^ mor\'^^ ^T for the melting transition of H2O is calculated to be
8.4 juK at 5 T. Similarly, using reference values''^ for the diamagnetic
susceptibility of D2O ice and D2O water: -8.10 x 10"^ and -8.94 x 10"^,
respectively, and the entropy change for the melting of D2O ice: 5h - 5i =
22.67 J K~^ mol"\*^^ Ar for the melting transition of D2O is calculated to be
7.3 juK at 5 T. These facts show that the calculated results based on the
simple appUcation of Eq. (3) do not explain the observed results. Therefore,
an alternative interpretation is necessary to explain these experimental
results. Iwakasa and Ueno'^^ found that a near-infrared spectrum of water
shifted to the low frequency side by the application of the magnetic field of
14 T. Hosoda et al.^^^ found that the refractive index of water increased by
the application of a magnetic field of 10 T. Both effects were considered to
be due to the strengthening of hydrogen bonding by the application of the
magnetic field. ^^' ^^^ However, it is difficult to explain why the magnetic
field strengthens the hydrogen bonding. The diamagnetic energy ^mag of
H2O due to the magnetic field is represented by
^mag=^'K.//(2A/o) (4)
where Vm is the molar volume of H2O. £mag is calculated to be -1.62 mJ
mol"^ at 5 T. On the other hand, the energy of the hydrogen bonding is
between 5.4 and 18.8 kJ mol"^ estimated by various researchers,'^^ being 6
or 7 orders of magnitude larger than the diamagnetic energy of H2O.
Therefore, it is difficult to assume that the diamagnetic energy shown in
Eq. (4) directly contributes to strengthen the hydrogen bonding. At this
point, we would like to consider the idea of dynamic magnetic
susceptibility. In order to calculate x in Eq. (2) we have used the data of
the magnetic susceptibility which were measured statically, using a
microbalance and SQUID. According to Ramsey,'^^ however, the magnetic
susceptibility ;|f of a diamagnetic molecule is expressed as
;f = ^static + ;f hf (5)
where the first term is the usual static diamagnetic susceptibility and the
second term is the dynamic or high frequency diamagnetic susceptibility
due to molecular motions such as rotation and vibration under a strong
magnetic field. Ramsey also gave a theoretical equation of x^^ for the
rotational part of diatomic molecules.''*^ Since H2O is a polarized molecule,
the charge of the nucleus and electrons in the molecule cannot be cancelled
completely. Then the thermal motion of the partially charged atoms of H2O
in the magnetic field gives rise to the Lorentz force at temperatures near
the melting point. The Lorentz force would suppress the thermal motion of

--- Page 340 ---

324 7 Novel Magnetic Field Effects
the partially charged atoms, strengthen the hydrogen bonding'^' ^^^ and
increase the dynamic magnetic susceptibility. The term "dynamic" means
the movement of atoms due to thermal motions such as vibrating and
rotating motions at high frequencies. The suppression of the thermal
motions by the magnetic field makes the solid phase relatively more stable
and makes the dynamic magnetic susceptibility larger. Therefore, we can
regard x in Eq. (2) as the dynamic magnetic susceptibility rather than the
static magnetic susceptibility. The linear dependencies of AT as a function
of the square of the magnetic field for H2O, as shown in Fig. 7-3-3, and for
D2O and HDO support this assumption. The reason for the larger
temperature shift in the melting transition for D2O than that for H2O is not
clear at present but may be related to the difference in the thermal motions
between H2O and D2O. The D2O ice has a considerably larger molar heat
capacity and a larger linear thermal expansion coefficient than H2O ice in
the temperature region higher than 150 K, according to Petrenco and
Whitworth.^^^ The vibrational and rotational modes of D2O have lower
frequencies than those of H2O due to the heavier mass of hydrogen atoms,
so they are more easily excited, giving a larger heat capacity and a larger
linear thermal expansion coefficient. Therefore, a larger number of
vibrational and rotational modes are considered to be excited at
temperatures near the melting point in D2O ice. Such modes in D2O ice
would contribute more to increase the dynamic magnetic susceptibility in a
strong magnetic field.
7.3.2 Magnetic Field Effect on the Ferroelectric Transition of Single
Crystalline KD2PO4
The second example of magnetic field effect on the phase transitions of
diamagnetic materials is the ferroelectric transition of single crystalline
KD2PO4 (DKDP)^^ using the high resolution and super-sensitive DSC
working in a magnetic bore. DKDP belongs to a family of ferroelectric
crystals in which the molecular units are linked by hydrogen bonds. Their
hydrogen bonds are preferentially oriented in a specific direction in the
crystal lattice. In the DKDP crystal, O-H bonds lie in the c plane.
Diamagnetic anisotropy was reported for the hydrogen-bonded
ferroelectrics due to the anisotropy of spatial atomic distribution. DKDP is
known to have a ferroelectric phase transition at about 220 K from a
ferroelectric orthorhombic structure to a paraelectric tetragonal structure. ^^^
The transition temperature of DKDP with a magnetic field of 5 T along the
a axis and the c axis was 5.6 ± 0.8 mK and 2.8 ± 0.9 mK, respectively,
higher than that without the magnetic field. The temperature shift of the
phase transition due to the magnetic field was negative and about three
orders of magnitude larger than the calculated one using the magneto-
Clapeyron equation shown in Eq. (2), if data of the static diamagnetic
susceptibility are used. Therefore, the use of the static diamagnetic

--- Page 341 ---

7.3 Magnetic Field Effects on Phase Transitions in Diamagnetic Materials 325
susceptibility does not explain the experimental results. Instead, if it is
assumed that the dynamic magnetic susceptibility proposed by Ramsey is
predominant, the experimental data are understandable using the same
magneto-Clapeyron equation. The thermal motion of constituent ions in
DKDP is considered to be suppressed due to the Lorentz force under the
magnetic field, making the low temperature phase more stable. However, it
is not clear why the shift in the transition temperature along the a axis is
higher than that along the c axis.
7.3.3 Magnetic Field Effect on the Liquid Crystal to the Isotropic
Liquid Transition of iV-p-ethoxybenzylidene-p'-butylaniline
The third example of magnetic field effect on the phase transitions of
diamagnetic materials is the liquid crystal to the isotropic liquid transition
of A^-/7-ethoxybenzylidene-/7'-butylaniline (EBBA).^^ EBBA is known to
have a liquid crystalline phase near room temperature and have a phase
transition from a nematic phase to an isotropic liquid phase at about 352 K.'^^
For the DSC measurement, about 3 mg of sample was enclosed in an
aluminum capsule. The heat flux measurements of EBBA were made
between 233 and 363 K at a heating and cooling rate of 1 mKs"' using the
DSC.^^ The crystal-liquid crystal transition and the liquid crystal-isotropic
liquid transition were observed at 309.0 K and at 352.7 K, respectively.
The magnetic effect on the liquid crystal-isotropic liquid transition was
measured under the same condition. The same measurements were
repeated twice, indicating almost the same results. The averaged melting
temperature of EBBA with a magnetic field of 5 T was 19.8 ± 1.6 mK,
higher than that without the magnetic field, as shown in Fig. 7-3-4. The
results measured at the cooling rate of 1 mKs"' showed almost the same
results except for a slight change in the transition temperature, showing the
reversible nature of the transition. EBBA is a linear molecule and has a
diamagnetic anisotropy. Since the diamagnetic susceptibility perpendicular
to the molecular axis is larger than that parallel to the molecular axis'^^
because of the large contribution of the benzene ring, EBBA molecules are
considered to be oriented along the magnetic field. The temperature shift
of the phase transition by the application of the magnetic field of 5 T for
EBBA can be calculated using Eq. (2). It was calculated to be 0.25 mK
using the reference values for (xw - ;fi)J^^ and assuming that x±, i = X-L^ h,
cos^©h = 1/3 and cos 0\ = 0. The calculated value is two orders of
magnitude smaller than the observed value, 19.8 mK. In order to explain
the larger experimental values, two kinds of mechanisms may be
considered. One is the assumption that a partially ordered state during the
phase transition determines the entire phase transition. For example, an
ordered state even in the liquid phase can be assumed and it can be grown
to nuclei of the solid phase due to magnetic orientation under a strong
magnetic field. Therefore, the transition temperature under a strong

magnetic field can be determined by the far smaller entropy change
between a partially ordered state in the liquid phase and the state with
nuclei of the solid phase in Eq. (2) than the total entropy change between
the liquid crystal and the isotropic liquid.^^ The other mechanism is the
effect due to the Lorentz force acting on the partially ionized moving
atoms. Since EBBA has polarized components of -CNH and -OC2H5, they
may be partially ionized and the thermal motion of the molecule may be
suppressed by the magnetic field, rendering the low temperature phase
more stable. Then the dynamic magnetic susceptibility is considered to
contribute mainly to the magnetic susceptibility in Eq. (2).
7.3.4 Magnetic Field Effect on the Rotator Transition and Melting
Transition in C32H66
The fourth example of the magnetic effect on the phase transitions of
diamagnetic materials is the rotator transition and melting transition in
C32H66.^^ In this case, the transition temperatures due to the rotator
transition and the melting transition under a strong magnetic field became
higher. The calculated temperature shift using Eq. (2) and static magnetic
susceptibility was three orders of magnitude smaller than the observed one.
Since C32H66 is also a flexible linear molecule like EBBA, the reason for
the magnetic effect may be considered to be similar to that for EBBA.

7.4 Diamagnetic Anisotropy of Inorganic Insulators Deriving
from Individual Chemical Bonds and Detection of Small
Magnetic Anisotropy Using Micro-gravity
7.4.1 Detection of Magnetic Anisotropy with High Sensitivity
Various magnetic effects have been reported for diamagnetic materials in
high magnetic field which are considered to derive from the intrinsic
diamagnetic anisotropy (A;f)DiA of the material.'^^ The numerical (A;if)DiA
values are essential in investigating the alignment process quantitatively;
however, the values are too small to be detected by the conventional torque
methods in many cases.^^ The magnetic effects are hence currently
recognized for a limited number of materials.^^
Conventional torque methods used to measure magnetic anisotropy
are based on a principle proposed by Krishnann and Banergee;'*^ the
method is based on a balance between the magnetic anisotropy energy
induced in the sample and the restoring force of the fiber suspending the
sample in a horizontal field B. The direction of the magnetically stable axis
rotates in the horizontal plane. Rotational equation for a solid body having
a magnetic anisotropy A;f(emu g"') is described as
I(d^e/dt'-) = -(\/2)B'NAxsin2e-iD/f)e d)
Here 9 is the angle between B and the direction of the stable axis. / and N

denote the tensional rigidity and the length of the fiber, respectively. It is
seen that the sensitivity of the measurable Ax value is limited by D and i in
the conventional methods.
The term of restoring force energy in Eq. (1) is controlled to be
negligible compared to that of magnetic anisotropy energy by the present
authors for the purpose of improving sensitivity.^ ^^ Direction of the
magnetically stable axis shows rotational harmonic oscillation with respect
to B in the improved method, as shown in Fig. 7-4-1(a), and Ax is obtained
from the period of oscillation r without the use of D and £ as
Ax = 4KIN~\BT)~^^ ; Aj is obtained with high precision from the gradient of
the proportional relationship observed between r and ^'(see for example
Fig. 2 of reference 8). A Ax value as small as 10'^ emu/sample was
detected in the field intensity of 5 T using a sub-millimeter size single
crystal of a-quartz having a weight of 8 x 10"^ g.^^

paramagnetic susceptibility (A;f)pARA deriving from the impurity ions. The
(A;if)pARA components, which followed the Curie law, were extracted effectively
by measuring the temperature dependence of A;^; the Is^-T relationships were
measured for several crystals having different paramagnetic concentrations
for a single material. The high temperature limits of A;f converged to a
single value, which was identical to the intrinsic (A/)PARA value of the
material as described in Fig. 7-4-1(b) for diaspore single crystals.^^ Small
(Aj;f)DiA values of the order of 10~^ emu g~' were detected by the
improvements mentioned above. Accordingly, (A;f)DiA values were newly
obtained for 13 basic oxides listed in Table 7-4-1.^'^^ Detection of these
(A;f)DiA was possible from a mm-size single crystal containing
paramagnetic impurity ions. (A;f)DiA values were previously measured only
on large diamagnetic material crystals which can be obtained with high
purity. The obtained sensitivity, however, is not high enough to achieve
further accumulation of (A;f)DiA values; accumulation is required to clarify
the overall characteristics of diamagnetic anisotropy of various
diamagnetic materials described in section 7.4.2.
The fiber itself should be deleted from the method described above in
order to realize further improvement of sensitivity. A preliminary
observation to examine this principle was performed at the Micro-gravity
Laboratory of Japan (Toki, Gifu, Japan). A typical example of a visual
image of a graphite crystal floated in micro-gravity is shown in Fig.
7.4.1(d)-(g).''^ The sample, in the form of a rectangular prism, is stabilized
in micro-gravity. A set of parallel planes of the prism having the widest
area, which were identical to the magnetically stable c plane of graphite,
showed rotational oscillation with respect to B applied in the vertical
direction in the figure. Periods of oscillation x of the samples were
measured from the images, r was calculated by deleting the second term of
Eq. (1) as
T = 2;r(//A^A/)-'^'^-'(l + (l/4)sin-(eo/2) + ---) (2)
where ^o denotes the angle of amplitude which was 45° in the present
experiment, ^x is obtained by inserting the measured values of r, B, N, 6Q
and / in the above equation. The A;^ value obtained was consistent with the
published value of graphite,^'^ indicating that factors other than magnetic
torque can be neglected as the cause of the observed oscillation. It is
expected from Eq. (2) that the sensitivity of A;^ is improved by increasing
B and r; no factor is detected which limits the improvement of sensitivity
in the above measurement so far. The sensitivity measured in micro-
gravity was improved recently to the order of 10~^ emu g"' by increasing
the field intensity to 1.3 T.^^^ Very small A;^ may be detected in an orbital
laboratory where a long r of range of 1 minute can be measured.
Development of the measuring system is now being carried out to achieve
the expected sensitivity.

7.4.2 Origin of Diamagnetic Anisotropy of Inorganic Materials
The origin of anisotropy was explained systematically for the first time on
ionic oxide crystals by assigning a constant (AJ)DIA value on individual
electron orbitals of the chemical bonds composing the crystal.^^ ^^^ The
analysis was based on the (A;f)DiA values of oxides listed in Table 7-4-1. A
similar assumption was previously done to explain the (A;^)DIA values of
organic molecular crystals.^ "^^ Diamagnetic susceptibility of a nonmetallic
material is approximately equivalent to the sum of susceptibilities assigned
to the individual electron orbitals comprising the material according to
Pascal's law.^^ This summation can be described by the 3-dimensional X'
tensor of a material, assuming that each orbital possesses a constant
uniaxial anisotropy A/BO = jfeon - X^ou where JBOH and ;|fBoi denote the
susceptibilities parallel and perpendicular to the bond direction,
respectively; the bond direction is identical to the principle axis.'^ ''^^
Anisotropy of a bond is obtained from a field-induced free energy.

Here the direction cosines of i? is defined as (a,b,c), whereas (a,p,y) denote
the direction cosines of the bond direction; the jc, y and z coordinates of the
vector components described above are identical to the three magnetic
principle axes of the crystal. According to the above model, (A;f)DiA values
of the crystal between x-y, y-z and z-x axes should be proportional to, la^ -
Ip^, 1(5^ - Xy^ and Xy' - la', respectively. Ia'\ X/J' and ly^ are calculated
for all the bonds included in a unit cell of the material; the calculations can
be performed for any crystal using the published data of atomic positions.
The positive correlations expected in the model were clearly seen for three

types of chemical bonds, as illustrated in Fig. 7-4-2/^^ namely for the T-0
bonds composing the tetrahedral [TO4] units,'^^ for the hydrogen bonds^^
and for the M-O bonds of the [MOe] units/'*^ The diamagnetic anisotropy
of a single bond is determined from the gradient of the regression lines as
Hydrogen bond: A/BO = -3.7 X 10"^° emu (4)
T- O bond of a tetrahedral [TO4 ] unit: A;^BO = -1.1 X 10"^^ emu (5)
M- O bond of an octahedral [MOe ] unit: A;^BO = -0.32 x 10"^^ emu (6)
The negative values of Eqs. (4)-(6) show that the three types of bonds all
have easy plane type of anisotropy with their bond directions being the
unstable axes. The large differences between the three A;fBo values derive
from the difference in the electron density distribution of each orbital.
Quantitative analysis of this difference is a subject of theoretical solid state
physics.

332 7 Novel Magnetic Field Effects
The A;fBo of the bonds arranged in various directions cancel out when
the [TO4] units or the [MOe] units hold regular symmetry in the crystal
structure. However, both units usually show a slight distortion from regular
symmetry in an actual crystal structure: This distortion was concluded to
be the major cause of the measured (A;f)DiA.'^^ For example, the tetrahedral
[TO4] unit is compressed in the direction of a axes in the case of a-quartz;
accordingly the bond direction is preferentially aligned toward the c axisJ^^
The three chemical bonds are the major types of bonding orbital that
compose inorganic oxides. Most of the unmeasured oxides hence possess
finite (A;f)DiA, since the distributions of bond directions are generally not
isotropic in a crystal structure with the exception of materials possessing
cubic symmetry^ ^^^^; these materials have the potential of causing
magnetic alignment at low field intensity, as observed in Fig. 5-7-
l(b)(c)(d).^^^ Accordingly, most of the oxide crystals have the potential to
cause magnetic effects deriving from magnetic anisotropy at finite field
intensity. Data accumulation on various types of oxide crystals is required
in order to examine the efficiency of the model. Sensitivity obtained at
terrestrial gravity is not high enough to detect the (A;^)DIA values mentioned
in section 7.4.1. Measurement in micro-gravity described in Fig. 7-4-1
may be the breakthrough required for further accumulation of (AJ)DIA data.
7.4.3 Conclusions
1. A new principle to detect magnetic anisotropy ^x ^ith high sensitivity
was established by observing a field-induced rotational-oscillation of
the stable axis with respect to the field direction. Sensitivity can be
improved by minimizing the restoration force of the fiber suspending
the crystal in a horizontal field; the restoration force is the standard in
measuring A;f in conventional methods.
2. The fiber itself was deleted from the above method in order to improve
sensitivity. Rotational oscillation was observed for a mm-size single
crystal of graphite floated in micro-gravity in a low magnetic field of
0.015 T. The amount of (A;t')DiA data is expected to increase
considerably by improving this method.
3. (A;|f)DiA data were obtained for various inorganic oxides, i.e., apophylite,
corundum, forsterite, orthoclase, KDP, ADP, hexagonal ice, gypsum,
muscovite, petalite, scapolite, talc, MgO, Mg(OH)2, Al(OH)3 and
AlOOH. The (A;f)DiA value obtained is essential in analyzing magnetic
alignments of small particles dispersed in the fluid medium described
in section 5.7.
4. Published (AJ)DIA values of inorganic oxides were explained consistently
by assigning a constant amount of (A;^)DIA on individual chemical bonds.
The assigned {^x)^\^ values were 3.7 x 10"^^ emu for a hydrogen bond,
1.1 X 10"^^ emu for a T-O bond composing the tetrahedral [TO4] units
and 0.32 x 10'^ emu for a M-O bond of the octahedral [M06] units;

these bonds are the major types of chemical bonds composing the
inorganic oxides.
5. Most of the inorganic oxides have the potential of possessing a finite
amount of (A;f)DiA to cause magnetic alignment as well as other
magnetic effects due to magnetic anisotropy according to conclusion
no. 4 above. The possibility of producing new magnetic devices is
expected to increase considerably when the selection of magnetically
active materials is expanded to solid nonmagnetic materials in general.

7.5 Magnetic Field Effects on Photo-induced Ultrafine Particle
Formation in Gas Phase
Several gaseous molecules such as carbon disulfide (CS2) and acrolein (2-
propenal) (AC) can produce aerosol particles in the gas phase under
ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation with a mercury lamp^^ and a N2 laser.^^
The photochemical reaction to produce aerosol particles was utilized to
synthesize composite ultrafine particles from some gaseous mixtures.
Considering the rapid development of nanotechnologies in various fields,
synthesis of novel ultrafine and nanometer-size particles can contribute to
building nanometer-size devices by assembling various kinds of
nanoparticles. The photochemical method to synthesize ultrafine particles^^
utilizes photochemical reactions of AC and/or CS2. Radicals and other
chemically active species generated from AC and CS2 induce chemical
reactions of other gaseous components such as organosilicon compounds
and organometal compounds.
The photochemical particle formation processes can be divided into

--- Page 350 ---

334 7 Novel Magnetic Field Effects
three phases, i.e., (1) nucleation process of the particle in which several
molecules react chemically to form a nucleus, (2) propagation process of
the nucleus by reacting chemically with surrounding molecules by
collision, and (3) particle growth by coagulation and condensation with
other (already grown) particles (accumulation mode). The gas-phase
photochemical method has several advantages in the nucleation and
propagation processes over particle formation in solution.
These advantages are as follows. (1) Under irradiation with intense
laser light, gaseous molecules can be excited to a higher excited state
and/or ionic state by two-photon, sometimes by multi-photon processes,
followed by unique chemical reactions which differ from the chemical
reactions of the first excited state usually observed in solution chemistry."^' ^^
(2) Chemical reactivity of the surface of the nucleus in mesoscopic size is
largely different from that of the bulk material. This may induce novel
chemical reactions and fix chemical products with unique chemical
structures in the particles. Furthermore, photochemical reactivity of the
surface makes it easy to chemically modify the surface characteristics by
exposing the particles to a particular atmosphere of organic molecules.^^
(3) In the gas-phase photochemical method, controlling the particle size
can be achieved by regulating the period of photochemical reactions.
Usually, particles travel by convection only once inside the irradiation
vessel and are captured at the substrate accommodated at the bottom of the
irradiation vessel. Hence, in order to obtain smaller particles, it is
appropriate to use an irradiation vessel with a smaller diameter.^^ (4)
Ultrafine particles synthesized photochemically preserve the
photochemical reactivity even after sedimentation. This can be used to
immobilize the particles on a substrate and to connect the particles to each
other.^^
The above characteristics are favorable for assembling particles into a
nanometer-size device. The magnetic field is expected to influence the
nucleation and propagation processes in aerosol particle formation. In this
section, experimental results on magnetic field effects on some gaseous
mixtures are presented and changes in chemical compositions of
sedimentary particles induced by the magnetic field are briefly discussed.
7.5.1 Glyoxal/Acrolein Mixture
In contrast to a previous finding that polymerization of AC in the vapor
phase resulted in production of a white powder (called laser snow) under
UV light irradiation,^^ gaseous AC produced sedimentary spherical aerosol
particles of polyacrolein by a two-photon process under N2 laser light
irradiation.^^ Improvement of the efficiency of aerosol particle formation
has been done by involving glyoxal (GLY) molecules. GLY can initiate
chemical reactions by one-photon absorption of visible light (370-460 nm).
Actually, under visible light irradiation at 435.8 nm with a mercury lamp, a

--- Page 351 ---

7.5 Magnetic Field Effects on Photo-induced Ultrafine Particle Formation in Gas Phase 335
gaseous mixture of GLY and AC produced white and spherical aerosol
particles with a mean diameter of 0.94 ^m (in a cylindrical cell with inner
diameter of 35 mm).^^ The product yield of the sedimentary particles
increased almost linearly with increasing partial pressure of GLY (between
1.5 and 3.5 Torr). From analysis of FT-IR spectra of sedimentary particles,
polymeric species originating in chemical reactions between AC and GLY
were found to be the major components.
The nucleation process in aerosol particle formation can be studied
by measuring monitor (He-Ne laser) light intensity scattered by aerosol
particles. As for the gaseous mixture of GLY and AC, the measurement
showed that with increasing partial pressure of GLY (from 0.3 Torr to 1.6
Torr), (1) the scattered light intensity became stronger, and (2) the
induction period to detect scattered light became shorter. Generally, during
the induction period, the nucleation reaction is followed by particle
growth. Hence, the induction period is a good measure for determining the
nucleation and propagation reaction rate in aerosol particle formation.
Furthermore, scattered light intensity after reaching maximum value is
proportional to the number of aerosol particles of various sizes when a
specific particle size distribution is maintained during the entire period of
UV light irradiation as in this case. Hence, the increase in the scattered
light intensity and the shortening of the induction period in GLY/AC
gaseous mixture indicated that electronically excited GLY molecules
initiated chemical reactions with AC to produce aerosol particles under
Ught irradiation at 435.8 nm.
For the GLY/AC gaseous mixture, magnetic field effect on the
nucleation process was detected from the measurement of the scattered
light intensity of monitor light.^^ The gaseous sample was placed in an
electromagnet and a constant magnetic field of up to 6 kG was applied
during light irradiation. In the presence of a magnetic field of 5.3 kG, the
induction period to detect scattered light became shorter and the scattered
light intensity became stronger until 40 min. In a separate experiment, we
observed that the size distribution of the sedimentary particles did not
change with the application of a magnetic field. These results indicated
that the magnetic field accelerated the nucleation reaction and increased
the number of aerosol particles being formed.
Furthermore, in the GLY/AC gaseous mixture, the convection of
aerosol particles in the gas phase was considerably influenced by the
application of a magnetic field.^^ This phenomenon is related to the change
in heat release due to nonradiative processes of excited glyoxal, because
the convection of gaseous molecules is induced by the released heat. We
can describe chemical processes in aerosol particle formation as follows.
Photoexcited glyoxal in the singlet n-;r* state ('GLY) efficiently
intersystem-crosses to the triplet manifold ("^GLY), and the triplet state
initiated photochemical reactions of GLY:

GLY -> 'GLY -^ 'GLY (D
As for the photochemical reactions of GLY, an intermediate complex, M,
between ^GLY and GLY in the ground state was postulated.'^^ It was
further supported from opto-acoustic measurement that the long-lived
complex, M, relaxed only by a bimolecular encounter of the complex to
produce photoproducts and heat.''^
'GLY-hGLY->M (2)
M+ M -^ Products + Heat release (3)
Following this scheme and considering the fact that AC in the ground
state may form a complex with excited glyoxal, the nucleation reaction of
aerosol particles from the gaseous mixture of GLY and AC may be
initiated by a complex formation between ^GLY and AC in the ground state
accompanying heat release:
^GLY+AC-^M' (4)
M'+ M' -^ Products + Heat release (5)
Acceleration of the nucleation reaction under a magnetic field is
accompanied by larger heat release to change the spatial distribution of
heat inside the irradiation cell, followed by a change in the convection of
gaseous molecules.
7.5.2 Glyoxal/CS2 Mixture
A. Light Irradiation at 435.8 nm
Under light irradiation at 435.8 nm, a gaseous mixture of GLY and CS2
produces aerosol particles at the early stage of light irradiation, followed
by the deposition of a thin film as the final product.'^^ Under light
irradiation at 435.8 nm, pure GLY vapor deposits a thin film but pure CS2
vapor does not produce any deposits, because CS2 molecules do not absorb
light longer than 350 nm. Morphological change of the product under
visible light irradiation, i.e., formation of aerosol particles from the
gaseous mixture, is due to the incorporation of CS2 molecules into chemical
reactions. Product yield of the total deposits from the gaseous mixture
increases almost linearly with increasing partial pressure of GLY (above
L5 Torr to 4.5 Torr), indicating that electronically excited GLY molecules
initiate chemical reactions.
Magnetic field effect on the nucleation process in aerosol particle
formation was detected for a gaseous mixture of GLY (3.5 Torr) and CS2
(60 Torr). Monitor (He-Ne laser) light scattered by aerosol particles as
formed in the irradiation cell was detected only for the first 20-30 min as
shown in Fig. 7-5-1, indicating that the aerosol particle formation is a
dominant process only in the early stage of photochemical reaction,
and the deposited particles contribute to the film formation process. With

the application of a magnetic field of 5.1 kG, the induction period to detect
scattered light became shorter (from 80 s to 40 s) and the scattered light
intensity became stronger. As in the case of the GLY/AC mixture,
magnetic field accelerated the nucleation reaction and particle growth.'^^
With the application of a magnetic field, a change in the
sedimentation pattern, i.e., change in convection of aerosol particles in
the gas phase, was also observed for the GLY/CS2 gaseous mixture.^^^
The sedimentation pattern observed after 40 min under light irradiation
(which is straight along the incident light path without a magnetic field)
curved to the right with increasing magnetic field. From the experimental
results of both GLY/CS2 and GLY/AC gaseous mixtures where only GLY
is excited electronically, it is concluded that chemical reactions
originating from ^GLY are accelerated with the application of a magnetic
field.
B. Light Irradiation at 313 nm
As for the gaseous mixture of GLY and CS2, 313 nm light of mercury lamp
can excite predominantly CS2 molecules, which can also initiate the
nucleation reaction of aerosol particles. Actually, under light irradiation at
313 nm, a gaseous mixture of GLY (6 Torr) and CS2 (60 Torr) produced
only spherical aerosol particles.'^^ Product yield increased with increasing
partial pressure of CS2. As shown in Fig. 7-5-2, the monitor (He-Ne laser)
light scattered by aerosol particles as formed in the cell was detected
during the entire period under light irradiation, confirming that aerosol
particle formation is the predominant process. In the electromagnet, a
magnetic field of 5 kG was applied to the gaseous mixture. Then, we
observed that the induction period to detect scattered light became longer

(from 14 s to 45 s) and the scattered light intensity became weaker. This
result indicated that the magnetic field decelerated the nucleation and
propagation reactions in contrast to the case where the 435.8 nm light was
irradiated on the same gaseous mixture.'^^ Deceleration of the reaction is in
accord with the fact that the product yield of the sedimentary aerosol
particles from the gaseous mixture decreased to one third under the
appUcation of a magnetic field of 5 kG.
To investigate magnetic field effect on chemical compositions, a
strong magnetic field of up to 5 T was applied using a helium-free
superconducting magnet during light irradiation at 313 nm. Sedimentary
aerosol particles deposited on a glass plate were collected and mixed with
KBr powder to prepare a KBr pellet. FT-IR spectra measured with the KBr
pellets are shown in Fig. 7-5-3. With increasing magnetic field up to 5 T,
the 1060 and 1508 cm~^ bands due to CS2 polymerization decreased their
intensities and the shoulder at --1074 cm"^ became prominent, showing that
contribution from CS2 polymerization decreased under a high magnetic
field. ^'^
As for the photochemical reaction between GLY and CS2, we propose
that excited CS2 and GLY in the ground state form a complex (M"), and
M" reacts with GLY and CS2 (or CS2*) molecules to induce nucleation
reactions.

It was reported previously^'^^ that fluorescence intensity from CS2* is
reduced by 40% and 50%, respectively, by the application of magnetic
fields of6.1kG and 10 kG.
Depopulation of the singlet excited state of CS2 by a fast intramolecular
relaxation is caused by the application of a magnetic field. This result can
well explain the decrease in nucleation efficiency in aerosol particle
formation through Eq. (6) under a magnetic field. Considering the change
in the chemical compositions of the aerosol particles, the magnetic field
effect is more pronounced in Eq. (8) than in Eq. (7).
In the GLY/CS2 gaseous mixture, chemical reaction paths in aerosol
particle formation change depending on which molecule is excited under
light irradiation. A magnetic field influences various reaction paths

340 7 Novel Magnetic Field Effects
differently, and this phenomenon can be used to control the chemical
compositions of ultrafme particles by applying a high magnetic field.
7.5.3 Organosilicon Compound/CS2 Mixture
Organosilicon compounds can be incorporated into aerosol particle
formation processes. Trimethyl(2-propynyloxy)silane (TMPSi) is a reactive
molecule which itself can produce a deposit of polytrimethylsiloxy-
substituted polyhydrocarbon under light irradiation with ArF excimer laser
(193 nm),'^^ and a gaseous mixture with AC produces sedimentary aerosol
particles containing elemental silicon under N2 laser light irradiation (337
nm).^^
Under light irradiation with mercury lamp at 313 nm, a gaseous
mixture of TMPSi and CS2 deposited sedimentary aerosol particles of
yellowish brown color with a reproducible sedimentation pattern due to
convection of the gaseous mixture.'^^ Under the same experimental
conditions, pure CS2 produced sedimentary aerosol particles of reddish
brown color with a lower product yield. Because TMPSi does not have an
absorption peak at a wavelength longer than 200 nm and hence does not

absorb light at 313 nm, slight color change of the sedimentary particles and
the increase in the product yield for the gaseous mixture strongly suggest
that electronically excited CS2 molecules initiated the nucleation reaction
involving TMPSi molecules. This was confirmed by measuring the
monitor (He-Ne laser) light intensity scattered by aerosol particles,
revealing that with increasing partial pressure of TMPSi, the induction
period to detect scattered light became shorter and the scattered light
intensity became stronger. Both CS2 and TMPSi molecules contribute to
the nucleation and propagation processes in aerosol particle formation.
From analysis of X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and FT-IR spectra, the
chemical composition between TMPSi and CS2 of the sedimentary aerosol
particles was estimated to be 1:1-1:2 in molar ratio.
Magnetic field effect was detected on chemical compositions. From
the gaseous mixture of TMPSi (10 Torr) and CS2 (50 Torr), sedimentary
aerosol particles were produced in a helium-free superconducting magnet
under Ught irradiation at 313 nm. FT-IR spectra of the sedimentary aerosol
particles (Fig. 7-5-4) showed that with increasing magnetic field up to 5 T,
the band intensities at 1252, 845, and 752 cm'^ ascribed to the
trimethylsilyl group in TMPSi gradually decreased.'^^ The stoichiometry of
atoms from XPS analysis^^^ also supported the lower involvement of

magnetic field of 3 T. The XPS spectra of S 2p photoelectrons in Fig. 7-5-5
show that sedimentary aerosol particles deposited under a magnetic field
of 3 T contain more sulfur atoms in -C-S- bonding at the expense of sulfur
atoms in > C = S or Cu-S bonding. These results imply that the aerosol
particle formation process is not dominated by a single chemical pathway
but is composed of several chemical pathways competing with each other.
Initially formed transient species (CS2-TMPSi) with C = S and C-S
chemical bonds can react with CS2 TMPSi and (CS)2 species, and under a
magnetic field it reacts more favorably with CS2 molecules, resulting in a
higher abundance of C-S bonds than C = S bonds. In nucleation and
propagation processes in aerosol particle formation, a chemical pathway
which is favorable under the influence of a magnetic field is selected from
among several chemical pathways.
7.5.4 Organometal Compound/CS2 Mixture
The gas-phase photochemical method can be applied to synthesize metal-
organic composite parficles. Under UV light irradiation at 313 nm, a
volatile organometal compound, Fe(C0)5, produces crystalline-like ragged
deposits of ca. 20 and 4 //m in size, but a gaseous mixture of Fe(CO)5 and
CS2 produces spherical sedimentary aerosol particles (with a mean
diameter of 0.6 j^mY^K The morphological change in the deposits clearly

7.5 Magnetic Field Effects on Photo-induced Ultrafine Particle Formation in Gas Phase 343
shows that Fe(C0)5 reacted chemically with CS2 to produce aerosol
particles. As is seen from the FT-IR spectrum of the sedimentary aerosol
particles (Fig. 7-5-6), Fe(CO)5 is incorporated into the sedimentary aerosol
particles with chemical structures different from those deposited from pure
Fe(C0)5 vapor. The chemical composition of the particles was influenced
by the application of a magnetic field (Fig. 7-5-6). By increasing magnetic
field up to 5 T, band intensities in the 2000 cm"^ region (assignable to
C = O stretching vibration attached to Fe atom) increased, indicating that
the chemical reaction of Fe(C0)5 was accelerated under a magnetic field.
For the metal-organic composite particles, control of the chemical
structures of metal compounds is important to give some special
characteristics such as magnetic properties. Application of a high magnetic
field on gaseous organometal compounds during photochemical reactions
is a promising way to control chemical compositions of ultrafine and
nanometer-size composite particles.
7.5.5 Conclusions
A gas-phase photochemical method to produce aerosol particles from some
gaseous mixtures is proposed. Gaseous mixtures involve some organosilicon
compounds and organometal compounds in addition to AC and CS2, which
play an important role in initiating the nucleation reaction in aerosol particle
formation. In the photochemical method, nucleation and propagation
processes are influenced by the application of a magnetic field. Utilization
of the magnetic field effect on chemical reactions is useful to control the
chemical compositions and the mean diameters of ultrafine and nanometer-
size particles. The magnetic field effect will find many applications in
fabricating nanometer-size devices composed of nanoparticles.
