ABOUT THE VOLUME EDITOR
Born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and raised in western Massachusetts, Malcolm
Forbes completed his university training at the University of Illinois at Chicago,
receivingadoublemajorB.S.degreeinChemistryandMathematicstherein1983.
Heundertookdoctoral studiesattheUniversityofChicago,whereheworkedwith
the late Gerhard Closs on the study of unstable spin-polarized biradicals using
time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. In 1988, his accom-
plishmentsinthisareawererecognizedwiththeBernardSmallerPrizeforResearch
inMagneticResonance.Afterreceivinghisdoctoraldegree,Malcolmwasawarded
aNationalScienceFoundationPostdoctoralResearchFellowship.From1988to1990
heworkedattheCaliforniaInstituteofTechnologywithNathanLewisoninterfacial
chargetransferkineticsatsilicon/liquidjunctions.
InJuly1990,MalcolmjoinedtheDepartmentofChemistryattheUniversityof
North Carolina at Chapel Hill and was promoted to the position of Professor of
Chemistry in 1999. He has received a number of awards: a National Science
Foundation Young Investigator Award (1993–1998), a Japan Society for the
Promotion of Science Foreign Fellowship Award (1998–1999), the 2000 Sir
Harold Thomson Award from Elsevier, and most recently a 2007–2008 J. W.
Fulbright Fellowship from the U. S. State Department. Malcolm was co-Chair
of the 2008 Gordon Research Conference on Electron Donor–Acceptor
Interactions.

PREFACE TO SERIES
Moststablecompoundsandfunctionalgroupshavebenefitedfromnumerousmono-
graphsandseriesdevotedtotheiruniquechemistry,andmostbiologicalmaterialsand
processeshavereceivedsimilarattention.Chemicalandbiologicalmechanismshave
also been the subject of individual reviews and compilations. When reactive inter-
mediates are given center stage, presentations often focus on the details and
approaches of one discipline despite their common prominence in the primary
literature of physical, theoretical, organic, inorganic, and biological disciplines.
The Wiley Series on Reactive Intermediates in Chemistry and Biology is designed
tosupplyacomplementaryperspectivefromcurrentpublicationsbyfocusingeach
volumeonaspecificreactiveintermediateandendowingitwiththebroadestpossible
contextandoutlook.Individualvolumesmayservetosupplementanadvancedcourse,
sustain a special topics course, and provide a ready resource for the research
community. Readers should feel equally reassured by reviews in their speciality,
inspiredbyhelpfulupdatesinalliedareasandintriguedbytopicsnotyetfamiliar.
This series revelsin the diversityofits perspectivesand expertise. Where some
books drawstrength from their focused details, this series draws strength from the
breadth of its presentations. The goal is to illustrate the widest possible range of
literaturethatcoversthesubjectofeachvolume.Whenappropriate,topicsmayspan
theoreticalapproachesforpredictingreactivity,physicalmethodsofanalysis,strate-
gies for generating intermediates, utility for chemical synthesis, applications in
biochemistry and medicine, impact on the environmental, occurrence in biology,

from alkene addition reactions in the synthesis of novel polymers to fundamental
studiesofelectronicdistributionofspinandchargeinthestudyofdonor–acceptor

initially in fields such as photosynthesis, but they are now of interest in areas of

radicalshasgrowntotheextentthatanentirejournalisnowdevotedtothetopic:Free
RadicalsinBiologyandMedicine.Theubiquityofradicalintermediatesinchemistry
and biology has commanded attention from chemists, biologists, and physicists,
across a variety of subdisciplines, who are seeking to understand the structure,
reactivity, and dynamics of radicals in magnetic and chemical environments that
areoftencomplex.
To this end, high levels of theory have been developed in conjunction with a
sophisticatedarrayofexperimentaltechniquesthatnowmakeitpossibletomeasure
the properties of organic reactive intermediates with extraordinary precision. This
volume,oncarbon-centeredfreeradicalsandradicalcations,highlightsseveralofthe

A BRIEF HISTORY OF CARBON
RADICALS
MALCOLM D. E. FORBES
DepartmentofChemistry,UniversityofNorthCarolina,ChapelHill,NC,USA
Itmayseemdifficulttobelieve,butresearchoncarbon-centeredfreeradicalsisaboutto
closeoutitssecondcentury.In1815,Gay-Lussacreportedtheformationofcyanogen
(the dimer of .CN)by heating mercuric cyanide.1 Numerousexperiments involving
pyrolysis of organometallic compounds followed, most notably from Bunsen,2
Frankland,3andWurtz4inthe1840s.Allofthesereactionssuggestedtheexistence
of what we now know to be carbon-centered free radicals, but physical methods of
detectionwerestillmanydecadesaway,andthefieldbecamesomewhatstagnantinthe
latter half of the nineteenth century. From high-temperature gas-phase dissociation
reactions, it was well accepted that inorganic compounds such as elemental iodine
could exist in equilibrium with their atomic “radical” forms. In 1868, Fritzsche’s
observationofcolorchangesduetoformationofchargetransfercomplexesbetween
picricacidandbenzene,naphthalene,oranthracenerepresentedthefirstevidencefor
theexistenceofcarbonradicalcationsinaromaticsystems.5However,theattempted
isolationofneutralcompoundswithtrivalentcarbonwasanideathathaddefinitely
fallenoutoffavorbythe1880s.Thislackofinterestwasamplifiedbytheflourishof
newideassurroundingtetravalentcarbon(pushedexperimentallybythevapordensity
methodfordeterminingmolecularweights6)andbythegeometricalinsightprovided
byvan’tHoff’sproposaloftetrahedralcarbonin1874.7
Because of this status quo, the field was turned completely upside down with
Gomberg’sreportin1900ofthepreparationofthetriphenylmethylradical.8Apart
fromtheinfluentialsupportofNef,9Gomberg’sresultwasmetwithmuchskepticism.

But as is typical in the scientific endeavor, healthy criticism can provoke new
experiments to prove or disprove a novel result, and the carbon radical skeptics
wereslowlywonover.Theyear1900markedthebeginningofwhatwemightcallthe
“wetchemistry”eraofresearchoncarbon-centeredfreeradicals,althoughitshouldbe
notedthattherewerealsomanygas-phaseexperimentsthatwereusefulinestablishing
radical reactivity patterns. For example, Goldstein’s experiments with cathode ray
tubes provided the earliest physical method of detection of carbon-based radical
cationsinthegasphase.10Onthetheoreticalside,strongsupportfortheexistenceof
carbon-centered free radicals came from G. N. Lewis in 1916, whose ideas about
valenceshellsandtheoctetrulehadjustbeguntoemerge.11Lewiswasalsothefirstto
recognizethatmoleculeswithunpairedelectronswouldexhibitparamagnetism.12Itis
ratherastoundingtorealizethatbothofthesehypothesespredatetheadventofthe

insightforhistime.
The1920ssawaflurryofactivitiesinboththermalandphotochemicalinvestiga-
tions of gas-phase organic reactions, and chemists such as H. S. Taylor began to
hypothesize carbon-centered radicals as reactive intermediates in certain mechan-
isms.13In1929,PanethandHofeditzreportedtheiringenious“mirror”experiments
involvingthermolysisofvapor-phasePb(CH ) andotherorganometalliccompounds.

investigations in the early part of the twentieth century, led by the instrumentation
developmentsofThomsonandAston.18,19Theirworkduringtheseyearsbuiltdirectly
onGoldstein’s cathode ray resultsandlay thefoundationfor the emergingfieldof
organicmassspectrometry.
Theyear1937wasanauspiciousoneforfreeradicalchemistry,withthepublication
of an extensive review on solution-phase free radical mechanisms by Hey and
Waters.20 At about the same time, Kharasch proposed the now well-accepted
mechanism for anti-Markovnikov addition of HBr to alkenes in the presence of
peroxides,21areactionhehadinitiallyreportedwithMayo4yearsearlier.22Alsoin

carried out in frozen glasses with unstable radicals, was also a common early
technique,26 and this was an important component of Gomberg’s description of
thetriphenylmethylradical.WithLewis’recognitionofthelinkbetweenradicalsand

World War II (WWII), therewere no high-resolution methods available that could
definitively establish the structural (and magnetic) properties of carbon-centered
