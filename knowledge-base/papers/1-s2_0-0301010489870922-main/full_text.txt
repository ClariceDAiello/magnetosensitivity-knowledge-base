Effects of isotropic and anisotropic interactions on the recombination probability, net and multiplet CIDNP and CIDEP were
calculated. The calculations were based on spin dynamic investigations by the perturbation theory at short times after the radical
pair (RP) is formed. The anisotropic interaction contributions of the correlated and uncorrelated motions of the radicals of the
RP to the quantities observed and their dependence on the time between the consecutive contacts were extracted. The contribu-
tions of the anisotropic and isotropic interactions were compared. Quantitative estimates of these contributions to the magnitudes
observed are demonstrated, e.g., for a change of polarization sign.
1. Introduction
Magnetic and spin effects, observed in “cage” reactions of radical pairs (RPs), result in chemically induced
dynamic nuclear and electron polarizations (CIDNP, CIDEP), magnetic isotope effect, magnetic field depen-
dence of reaction quantum yields, etc. [ 11. It is well known that these effects are caused by the dependence of
the probability of transition to the reactive state, usually the singlet S state of the unpaired electron spins of the
RP, on a nuclear spin configuration and an external magnetic field. In high magnetic fields the frequency of the
singlet-triplet (S-T) transitions is determined by the difference of the Larmor precession frequencies of the
two unpaired electron spins. For a subensemble with the nuclear spin configuration {I,,,, ZBkz}t his difference
is given by

where g,, gB are the isotropic g factors of radicals A, B, respectively, and aAi, ank are the hfs-coupling constants
of the ith and kth nuclei of radicals A and B, respectively. Most experimental results on magnetic and spin
polarization effects in RP reactions can be explained by this frequency of S-T transitions, which is specific to
each nuclear configuration [ 11.
In general, the Zeeman and hf interactions of the unpaired electrons are’in fact anisotropic ones (g and a are
tensors). These interactions are modulated by the random thermal motion of the radicals in the liquid phase
and induce the transitions between different spin states and change phase coherences: the spin system relaxes.
In low viscous solvents these processes are usually slow compared with the rate of the S-T transitions described

by eq. ( 1) and may be neglected. However, this situation is changed if long-lived RPs are considered (e.g.,
radical reactions in high viscous liquids [ 2-41, ion-RP recombination [ 5-8 1, radical reactions in micelles [9 -
13 ] ). Several authors investigated an effect of paramagnetic relaxation on “cage” reactions [ 11,14-l 8 1. The
close connection between the efficiency of the relaxation mechanism of S-T mixing and the kinematics of con-
secutive contacts of the radicals in the “cage” was shown in ref. [ 171. For short times between consecutive
contacts the relaxation mechanism also appears to be effective. In previous theoretical treatments [ 11,14- 17 ]
the influence of paramagnetic relaxation on the recombination probability was considered, where the relaxation
was characterized by the phenomenological relaxation times T,, T,. A CIDNP effect caused by anisotropic mag-
netic interactions was discussed in ref. [ 1g -1. Calculations for the case of the rapid radical reorientations in low
viscous liquids were carried out. This allowed the Redfeld theory [ 19 ] to be used for relaxation term calculation.
The contribution of the anisotropic interactions to the recombination can appear to be comparable with that of
isotropic interactions on the assumption
(g : a)= 15r,(uAg)/2r0. (2)
Eq. ( 2 ) includes the inner product of the anisotropic parts of the g and a tensors, r2 is the time interval between
the two consecutive contacts, rO is the rotational correlation time, Ag=g,-gn. If (g : a ) is greater than obtained
from eq. (2) and sign (g : a ) # sign( aAg), the polarization sign is changed. Because of the approximations of
the Redlield theory eq. (2) is true only for r2 >> 70. In the reactions in the restricted diffusion systems the time
between two consecutive contacts and the rotation correlation time may be of the same order. Then the Redfield
theory is of no use.
In this paper we treat the spin dynamics of the RP with anisotropic interactions in more detail. Quantitative
CIDNP calculations, carried out previously in ref. [ 181, do not allow physical parameters regulating the spin
polarization to be obtained. Qualitative conclusions follow from the analysis of the RP spin motion affected by
the anisotropic and isotropic magnetic interactions.
The operator method is used to calculate the observable consequences of spin dynamics. It is based on the fact
that to calculate the CIDNP, CIDEP and recombination probability one need not provide all the information
contained in the spin density matrix. To interpret, e.g., CIDNP one needs the average value of a particular
nuclear spin projection on the external magnetic field direction ( Zkz) (net polarization) or the correlation
function of the two different spins ( Zk,Z,j )L (multiplet effect) in diamagnetic products of recombination. Thus
it is reasonable to solve the equation of motion only for measurable values. In ref. [ 1 ] the operator formalism
was used, where only isotropic magnetic interactions were regarded. In the present study the anisotropic inter-
actions are taken into consideration.
2. Spin-ordering operators
Consider an ensemble of RPs with the spin Hamiltonian JY, described by the density matrix p(t). RPs in the
S state only can recombine. Thus, the recombination probability p( t ) is determined by the population proba-
bility in the S state. The latter quantity describes the RPs in the reactive spin state at a time t. The population of
the S state is equal to the average of the projection operator Pon this state,
p(t) = <P(t) > =Tr.dp(t)Pl , (3)
where the trace over electron and nuclear variables is taken. P can be expressed by the total spin operator of the
two unpaired electrons in the RP S=S,+.S,,
P= 1 -s/2= (1/4-S*&) . (4)
Suppose that radicals in the RP have only one re-encounter at time t and that all RPs in the S state recombine,
then p( t ) equals the recombination probability. In reality a time distribution of the re-encounter probability,

which is determined by the physical properties of the system, should be considered. Besides, not all RPs do
recombine during one contact. Consecutive contacts are possible. These factors are essential for a quantitative
analysis, especially of long-lived RPs, and they should not be neglected. In the present study we investigate an
effect of anisotropic and isotropic interactions on the RP spin dynamics for short times with special emphasis
on spin evolution tendencies which cause, e.g., the spin polarization sign, the latter being mainly determined by
the spin dynamics.
The Zeeman spin energy of a particular nucleus is assumed to be a measure of CIDNP. Therefore the net
CIDNP can be described by the average magnitude of the operator [ 1 ]
KI, = - gd$, Bo P&,P . (5)
With eq. (4) we get the net polarization of the cage product calculating the mean value of the operator
K,= -g,~BlrBoIka(l/4-SASB) . (6)
To be precise, K,A is the value of the net polarization for the case of a (single!) encounter of the RPs at t and
complete recombination of the S state RPs. Similarly we may regard the following spin operators. The triplet
RPs do not recombine, but the radicals can react outside the “cage”. Polarization of these “escape” products,
therefore, is defined by the expectation value of Ikz in the triplet state:
K;, = -g,,~,6,,BoI,,(3/4+S,S,) . (7)
The CIDNP multiplet effect in the “cage” product can be obtained from the average value of the spin-spin
interaction in the S subensemble at the moment of recombination,
KM =tj&.,I,,( 1/4-S&) . (8)
In the “escape” products the multiplet effect reflects the mutual spin orientation in the T subensemble,
K,, = fii&& (314 +S& ) . (9)
Electron spin polarization is determined by the Zeeman electron energy. For the radical A, e.g., it can be written
as
&,, =gJBo&, . (10)
The mean values of the spin operators were calculated by the equation
K(t) = (K(t) > = (K(t)p(O) > , (11)
where p (0 ) is the density matrix at the moment of the RP formation and K(t) is determined by the equation
azuat= -ir?-‘[K, H] . (12)
The average values of the spin operators are equal to 0 at the time t = 0 (any residual polarizations KsA and
KsB due to the triplet mechanism [ 1 ] are not taken into account). If the S or To state is assumed to be a precur-
sor, the unpaired electron spins are correlated in the beginning, i.e. the correlation functions
PO= S,+S,_ +SA_sB+ (S, =S,?is,); P, =1/2+2&s, (13)
are nonzero. The mean values of PO and P, are - 1 in the S state and + 1 in the To state. The RP spin states have
the following evolution: the initial mutual orientation of the two unpaired electron spins is transformed into the
orientation of electron and nuclear spins with respect to the magnetic field or the mutual spin orientation in S
or T subensembles. Therefore, the mean value K(t), characterizing the spin order, deviates from zero. The
equation of motion ( 12 ) involves the spin operators only. Diffusion and radical reactions (e.g., recombination
and reactions with acceptors) are not considered. With this in mind the conclusions as to the recombination
probability, CIDNP and CIDEP should not be considered as being absolute. Thus, e.g., the time dependence of

--- Page 4 ---

54 K. Liiders, KM. Salikhov /Spin polarization and magnetic field effects in radical pairs
the S state population of the RPs born in the T state is calculated, rather than the recombination probability.
Because the diffusion is independent of the particular spin state and the recombination is independent of the
particular nuclear spin state, the calculations based on the spin dynamics allow different mechanisms of the S-
T transitions to be investigated and qualitative rules for the effects under consideration to be established.
3. Hamiltonian
Anisotropies of the g tensor and hfs tensor were included in the model calculations. Thus, the Zeeman and hf
interactions depend on the orientation of radicals of the particular RP with respect to the external magnetic
field. The random rotational motion leads to a time dependence of these interactions. Thus, the RP Hamiltonian
takes the form
H(t) (14)
=His +Hanis tt) .
Considering the coupling with one nuclear spin in each radical, in the case of the strong magnetic field we obtain
the operators
(15)
R=A.B
ffanis(l)= R=CBBPSR6gR(r)Bo+g~R8aR(f)lR, (16)
whereg,= ( gRw+gRy+gRz)/3, 6gR=gR( t) -gRE and similarly for aR( t) and 6aR( t). The calculations can be
unified by using now spherical tensors instead of the Cartesian tensors 6a and 69. The necessary transformations
are analogous to those in ref. [ 201 and the result is
(- l)““F:(t)“AR_, . (17)
R=A,B;jic=&d
m= -2,...+2
The functions F:, depend on the orientation of the radical under consideration in the laboratory frame XYZ
and are transformed under rotation as second-order spherical functions. The g tensor principal axis system is
chosen to be the molecular frame xyz. The g and a tensor principal axis systems are assumed to be identical.
The orientation of a molecular frame with respect to the laboratory frame is described by the Euler angles c~,/ 3,
y. The random particle motion gives rise to the angles (Y/, 3, y and therefore the F& are time dependent. The latter
can be expressed by the Wigner rotation matrix via the components of the F tensor in the molecular frame,

For simplicity, the radical index R in eqs. ( 19)-( 22) is dropped. The quantities labeled by indices d and g
describe anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions and Zeeman interactions, respectively.

When there are several nuclei in the radicals, the Hamiltonian can be extended by analogous terms. Since the
anisotropic part of the Hamiltonian contains time-dependent coordinates it is necessary to carry out averaging
over all available values of coordinates along with spin state averaging. This coordinate averaging will now be
marked by a dash over the operator.
4. Solution of the equation of motion. Results and discussion
To determine K(t) eq. ( 12) must be repeatedly used and integrated. The result can be expressed by the
following series:
K(t)=K(O)+ jdf.X.(t’)+ J(,z’ jdl.K”(r’,r”)+ 1,’ jd,. jdt..ZC”‘(r’,r.$“)+..., (23)
0 0 0 0 0 0
where
K’(t’)=-in-‘[K(O),H(t’)], K”(t’,t”)=-~-2[[1Y(0),H(t”)],H(t’)],
K”(t’, t”, f”‘)=ifi-3[ [ [K(O),H(t”‘)],H(t”)],H(t’)] .
Below, the calculations will be terminated with the first term which gives a nonzero contribution to K(t). To
obtain the interaction contributions of different orders in K(t) the method of repetitive differentiations of op-
erators was used in ref. [ 11. However, that approach is correct only for the systems described by the time-
independent Hamiltonian. The expansion in the form of (23) enables K(t) to be calculated for systems with
time-dependent Hamiltonians.
4.1. Recombination probability calculations
In this section we analyse the effect of the anisotropic interactions on the RP recombination probability. We
are doing this rather thoroughly to demonstrate the basic steps of our method, based on the spin ordering oper-
ators. For the triplet precursor the recombination probability is determined by the probability pr_s (t) of RP
transition to the S state (we assume that all S RPs recombine during the first contact at the time t). Thus, pr_s
may be obtained using the projection operator Pinto the S RP state (see eqs. (3) and (4) ). The contributions
of the isotropic and anisotropic interactions to the equation of motion can be calculated separately:
aP,+s(t)iat= (aP,_s (24)
(f)lW, + (apT+dt)latLnis,
where
(aP,_,(t)lat)iS=-i~-‘[P,Hi,]
, (25)
(aP,-,(t)lat),,i,=-i~-‘[p,H.nisl . (26)
Using permutation relations for spin operators we obtain the isotropic interaction contributions from eqs. ( 15 ),
(25L
(27)
(aP,-,lat)is=-i~-‘BQo(~~0+g*a,l*,-g,aBIB,)/2,
where
Qo =SA+SB_ -&_S,+ .
Since only flAR -,nc ontains spin operators the contribution of anisotropic interactions from eqs. ( 18), (26)
follows:

Spin operators in eqs. (27 ), (29 ) characterizing electron and nuclear spin correlations (Qo, Q+, Q_ and their
combinations with I Rx, I R + , ZR _ ) have the average V&ES zero (eq. ( 11) ) . Therefore the next term in the series
of eq. (23) must be calculated. As a first step we shall proceed to average over spatial coordinates (angles).
Some terms resulting from K” commutators will become zero as a result of this averaging. The coordinates are
contained in Hanisa nd Kini, as Wigner matrices D,, (a, /I, y). We have (see ref. [ 2 1 ] )
2n ?I 2rr

therefore the linear terms in the D functions can be neglected.
Thus,
K”(t’, t”)= -ifi-‘{ [Kl,(t”) Jfi,(t’)] + [K:“iJ(t”) JYanis(t’)]} . (31)
By eq. ( 18 ) the second term in eq. (3 1) can be expressed as
Kai,( t’, t” ) = _fi-2 1 (__,)k+m Db(t”)Dt(t’)“F,RcFsrcK~~,_, , (32)

where
~LcK~~=[~lK~,cA~]=[ [K(O), pA’A,R],‘A:]. (33)
In averaging eq. (32) the degree of correlation of the orientations of the two RP radicals is important. If they
are independent, then the averages of D R( t N) D ’ ( t’ ) for R # S factorize and the result is
DR(t”)DS(t’) = D”(Y) DS(t’) =O. (34)
In general, the situation is more complicated. Firstly, at the moment the RP is born the partners may have a
definite mutual orientation, which is the same for the whole RP ensemble, so that
DR(0)DS(O) # DR(0) OS(O). (35)
Secondly, the rotational motion of the partners can also be mutually correlated. Of course, situations in which
eq. (34) is true are also possible. E.g., when an ion-RP is formed an electron may be transferred to the molecule

(acceptor), arbitrarily oriented with respect to the donor of the electron. Let us consider as an example the
following situation. Because of eq. (34) averaging over the orientations of the two RP radicals contributes only
when R = S. Expressions Dnk( LX8, , v) D,,,,( o!, /I, y ) , averaged over all orientations, are (see ref. [ 2 1] )
DnkDim = (- l)‘-m&,_,6,,_,/5 . (36)
Suppose that the random process DR( t) = D ( (YR( t), BR( t ), yR (t) ) has the only correlation time and the
rR
equation
D,R,(t” )Dt(t’ ) = D,kDl,,, exp[ (t” -t’)/$] (37)
is true. From spherical tensor symmetry properties we have
,=k=(-l)k,?k. (38)
Fromeqs. (32), (36)-(38) follows:
K&(t’,t”) =-~-2~~~~R~Fj:LF~(-l)k~~Rkexp[(t”-1’)/rR]/5, (39)
and after a twofold integration is carried out (see eq. (23 ) ) we have
(40)
Kanis(t) = -fZ-* &fR(f) “Ff:‘Fr(-l)k %!k/5,
where
fR(t)=ri [exp(-t/ra)+t/rR-1] . (41)
To obtain the contribution of the anisotropic interactions to K(t) eq. (40) should be averaged over the spin
state populations at t = 0 (see eq. ( 11) ). The nuclear spin states are always assumed to be equally populated at
t = 0. From this it follows that functions linear with respect to the nuclear spin operators I&, IR + , 1, _ give no
contribution to the K(t). Therefore,
(42)
(~R,P(~))=(~R+P(~))=(~R-P(~))=“.
In the abovedescribed particular case of determiningh,, for the isotropic part no averaging is necessary, so by

By eq. (42) the last two terms, when averaged over nuclear spin states, give no contribution, and integration

To obtain the contribution of the anisotropic interactions quantities “PF should be calculated. By eqs. (2 1))

spin operators leads to the expression

After the averaging over the nuclear spin states is accomplished, by eqs. (40)) (46) we have

We are now ready to average over the electron spin states at t = 0. (S,,&, ) has an average equal to - l/4 for
S and T,, states and + l/4 for T, and T_ states. For a T precursor (pTo7,,= PT+~+ = P~_~_ = l/3) we find that
P ~-sarns(t)=fi-~P*x fR(f)[(g: g)RBi+gi(a: a)RzR(zR+1)/31/18 (48)

and by eq. (44) the isotropic interaction contributes as
PT__S,s(f)=A-2P2 Ag*B$+ 1 giaiZ,(Z,+1)/3 t*/12.

The probability of finding T-born RPs at the time t in the S state can thus be expressed in virtue of eqs. (48 ),
(49) by the sum Z’,,,,(t) + Pi,( t). It should be noted that in accord with (48), (49) the contributions of the two
interactions to J+_~ are additive. Thus eqs. (48), (49) reflect the spin dynamic evolution resulting from the
isotropic and anisotropic interactions.
There are many papers dealing with spin dynamics during “cage” reactions [ 11. It is well known that in strong
magnetic fields the probability of finding T-born RPs in the S state is pss ( t ) = sin* (At/2 ) /3. If we expand this
expression in a power series and restrict ourselves to the first term, then it coincides with eq. (49 ). Previously
spin dynamic investigations with anisotropic interactions were carried out only for t X- T,, for whichf( 1) z r,t
[ 17,181. This applies to low viscous solvents. P T_S (t) was calculated for those systems where paramagnetic
relaxation times T, R, TZR properly describe the effect of anisotropic interactions. For subensemble with the
nuclear spin configuration {I,,,, IBkL}, eq. ( 17 ) of ref. [ 171 gives:
P,,,(t)=1/4- [exp(-t/T’,)]/12-cos(Awt)[exp(-t/T$)]/6, (50)
where l/T’, = 1 /T, A+ 1/ T, B, 1 /T; = 1 / T2A+ 1/ Tzs, Aw is the difference of Larmor frequencies wR of the two
unpaired electron spins of the RP (eq. ( 1) ). Damped oscillations are predicted by eq. ( 50) (see ref. [ 17 1, fig.
2). To compare the results of eqs. (48), (49) with eq. (50), the latter is expanded in a power series:
PT~S(t)~(l/T;+2/T;)t/12+(A~2-1/2T;2-1/T;2)t2/12+.... (51)
If we regard the case where relaxation is caused by g tensor anisotropy the paramagnetic relaxation rates are
[221
l/T,,=(g: g)R~-ZB2B~TR/5(1+02RT~),
l/TZR=(g: g)“~-*/3*B~zR[4+3/(1+w~~;)]/30. (52)
If we take wi ri -zz 1, i.e. the case of the weak magnetic fields and low viscous liquids, the insertion of eq. ( 52)
into eq. (5 1) leads to a linear term in eq. ( 5 1 ), which coincides with the term in eq. (48), caused by the g
tensor anisotropy. After being averaged over all the nuclear spin configurations the quantity AW2t2/ 12 in eq.
( 5 1) (where Ao E AmST,, in eq. ( 1) ) coincides with PT_s,s( t) in eq. (49). If the last two items in eq. (5 1) are

neglected (in low viscous liquids usually AU> 1/ T, , 1/ ‘TZ) , the results obtained are in a good agreement with
those given in ref. [ 17 1.
When the case t x rR is considered (it followsfR-+t2/2), the spin dynamics cease to depend on the rotation
correlation time. If S-T evolution is caused primarily by the Zeeman interaction, the recombination probability
becomes
Z’-r_s(t)=fi-Z/32B; c 3Ag2+ 1 (g : g)R ) t2/36. (53)

Similar expressions can be obtained provided S-T evolution is determined only by the hfi mechanism:
PT_s(~)=~-‘B’C~~R[~U~R+(~: a)R]ZR(ZR+l)t2/108. (54)
R
In the case t z%r-R the contributions of the isotropic and anisotropic interactions to the recombination probabil-
ity appear to be equal if the following condition is fulfilled:

and, analogously, in the case of the hfi mechanism:
F &(a : a)RzR(zR+l)rRz3 ~g~&zR(zR+l)t/2. (56)
R
The ratio of the anisotropic interaction effect to the isotropic one is, thus, dependent on the time prior to the
contact of the partners. If this time is comparable with the rotational correlation time, the anisotropic interac-
tion contributes to the recombinations probability even for short-lived RPs. These considerations refer to the
case of approximately equal populations of all triplet sublevels. The To level population for long-lived RPs, in
particular, with restricted diffusion and effective S-To mixing caused by the isotropic interactions is greatly
reduced due to recombination. Therefore, the anisotropic interactions modulating T+-S and T_-S transitions
appear to be more effective.
The time-dependent ratio P7_s.JPT_si, is shown in fig. 1. Here the conditions PT_sani.= PT_%. (see eqs.
(48), (49)) and r A= ra are supposed to be true in the quasistationary case (t < rR ). The curve trend reflects
the rules expressed by eqs. (53)-( 56): for t< rR the ratio PT_San,S/PT_S,ri s found to be almost unchangeable,
for t > rR it reduces proportional to t- ‘.

where yA is the gyromagnetic ratio of the unpaired electron of radical A. The contribution of the anisotropic
interactions to CIDNP is essentially affected by the orientation correlation of the RP partners. This correlation
may occur at the initial moment of RP formation. Rotational motion of the two RP radicals may also be mu-
tually correlated. In addition the recombination process can be selective with respect to the mutual orientations
of the two radicals. Thus, in general, particularly for short times, CIDNP should clearly reflect the presence of
the correlation effects under discussion.
In the very simple case of uncorrelated orientations we have
K ,~,=“iS(t)=-2y,,y,(g: a)R~ffR(t)(z2R~(7~~/12+S*~S~~))/5. (60)
From eq. (60) for a T precursor we get
K:R.anis(t)-=Y IRYR(g: s)RBkk(WRUR+ 1 l/27. (61)
The similar polarization for an S precursor may be easily obtained from eqs. ( 57 ) , ( 6 1) , because the following
connection is valid:
K;,(t)=-3KT,(t). (62)
For the contribution of anisotropic interactions the location of the particular nucleus either in radical A or in
radical B is indifferent to the sign of CIDNP (in the case of uncorrelated orientations). But it is of importance
when isotropic interactions are considered. It is irrelevant to anisotropic interactions, for there are no Ag or
similar quantities, resulting from the parameters of both radicals. The ratio of the contributions of anisotropic
and isotropic interactions to the net polarization is given by
K ,R.anls(t)lK,R.iS(t)=2(9: a)RfR(Q/34ref2 + (63)
Sign changing conditions for net polarization affected by the anisotropic interactions can be obtained from eq.
(63). For t> ~~ this is the case if the following equation is fulfilled:
(g: a)Rz -3AgaRt/2r,. (64)

An analogous expression was derived in ref. [ 18 ] (see eq. (2 ) ), where in the framework of the two-positional
exponential model consecutive contacts of the partners were considered and the longitudinal relaxation was
neglected. In addition, that expression was derived for the case of strong magnetic fields, when wi ri % 1. For
the case of low magnetic fields and low viscous solvents (0; ri a 1) the following equation was obtained in-
stead of eq. (2 ) by the method described in ref. [ 18 ] :
(9: a)Rx - 3@pR r22/bR . (65)
Because the nonsecular terms have been considered in the present calculations, eq. (64) should be compared
with eq. (65 ). Anisotropies calculated from eq. (65 ) for which the Kaptein rule is not available are greater than
those from eq. (64) (where t a ~~52).
A comment must be made on the fact that the contribution to CIDNP is determined by the magnetic reso-
nance parameters of the individual radicals (see eq. (6 1) ) in the case of uncorrelated radical orientation. Es-
sentially this implies that the magnetic relaxation time depends on the nuclear spin projection, i.e. on the hf
constant component of the ESR spectrum. This phenomenon is well known in ESR spectroscopy (see, e.g. ref.
[ 221). This mechanism of CIDNP origination differs greatly from the conventional mechanism according to
which CIDNP is the result of simultaneous actions of the isotropic hfi and the difirence of the isotropic g
factors.
If there is a correlation of the mutual orientations of the partners, the anisotropic interactions result in a
CIDNP effect very similar to the isotropic hti and Ag mechanisms. In the presence of the orientation correlation
of the RP partners the means of D R( t” ) Ds (t’ ) are nonzero for R # S. We use eq. (32) and determine contri-
butions into the CIDNP of those terms which are connected with the radical orientation correlations. For a T
precursor we get
Kz.aniscorr(t)= +hYR(gR : aS)B~fRS(t)lR(zR+1)/27, (66)
where
&S(t)= jdt’ jdt”xRs(t”-t’). (67)

The correlation function XRsi s defined in a way similar to eq. (37) by

The summary contribution of the anisotropic interactions to CIDNP can be expressed as
K&anis(t)=- [Y,RYRZR(~R+~)B~/~~I(~~~:A~(~)) y (69)
where
A~(t)=8gRfR(t)-89%(t) * (70)
This form of the anisotropic interaction contribution to CIDNP resembles the isotropic interaction contribution
(cf. eq. (59) ). The result obtained is connected with the RP spin dynamics (S-T transitions) reflecting the
instantaneous values of the hfi and g tensors of the two radicals of the RP.
4.2.2. Multiplet effect
To calculate the multiplet polarization the case when the two nuclei are located in different RP radicals is
considered first. From eqs. ( 8 ) , ( 15 ) , ( 23 ) the expectation value of the operator of the spin-spin interaction in
S subensemble at the moment of recombination is obtained
(71)

from which the Kaptein rule is derived,
ZLIS(t) cc -jABaAae (PO > . (72)
Anisotropic interactions do not contribute to the multiplet polarization, if the two nuclei are located in different
radicals of the RP with uncorrelated mutual orientations. This can be easily demonstrated by the following
consideration: Commutators pKR in eq. (33) imply the combinations of the products of the spin operators ZR,
S,, SB with Ian (R’ #R). Analogously, ‘AAsi mplies the combinations of the spin operators ZR, &. Since ZR>
commutes with ZR,S R, the values peKR are also products of the spin operator combinations ZR,S ,, S, with Za;.
Thus, the average of the operator jaKR becomes zero (eq. (42) ).
At the same time the multiplet effect may occur due to the mutual radical orientation correlation. The calcu-
lation gives
K ,4B,anis(t)=-2jtiABYAYB(aA: ~~)~A(IA+~)IB(ZB+~)(~P~/~~+SA%SB~)~AB(~)/~~. (73)
From this we get for a T precursor
KTIA 8.an,s(t)=-Jj*B~A~B(~A: aB)ZA(zA+l)ZB(Zs+llfAe(t)/81. (74)
Next we deal with the system in which both nuclei I,, I1 are located in the radical A. If the interaction between
the two nuclear spins during the RP lifetime is ignored and the principal axis systems of the two hti tensors are
identical, the Hamiltonian can be written as
H,,=Pg,S*,(B,+a,Z,.+a,Z,,)+Pg,B,S,,, (75)
Ha”,,(t)= C (-l)“‘DE,z’F~ “A!,,, (76)
R,{LflLlI
where p= g, d, , dz for R = A and p = g for R = B. The average of the operator of the spin-spin interaction of the
RP in the S state K,,, has to be calculated
ZL =Jtj12ZlLZ2J l/4-&&) . (77)
Including isotropic interactions, the result is
K,,,.i,(t)=~j,zY:u,uzZ,(Zl +l)Zz(Zz+l)<P~)t~Ilg , (78)
where in comparison with the rule of eq. (72) the sign is changed. The anisotropic interactions contribute as
K ,,z.,,i,(t)=2~j,2r:(a, : az)ZI(ZI+1)Z2(Z~+1)(7Po112+SAZSBZ)fA(t)/45. (79)
For a T precursor eq. (79) yields
KII ,l.anls(t) =fiLy:(a, : a2Vl (1, + 1 Mb + 1 lf,(O/81 . (80)
The analogous values for an S precursor can be obtained by eq. (62). For t xs- rA anisotropic effects are compa-
rable with isotropic ones if the relation
(a, : a2)=3u,u2t/27, (81)
is true. If sign ( a, : a, ) # sign ( a, a2 ) the multiplet polarization sign is changed.
4.3. Exchange interaction effects
In the above calculations the exchange interaction between the two RP radicals has not been considered. It is
known that the phase correlations of RP states are badly affected by the exchange interaction at the moment the
partners approach [ 11. Between the two consecutive contacts this interaction is weak, as well as its effect on the
S and T state populations. We will show this. The exchange interaction operator is

V, ,=-~(r*,)(1/2+2S,S,) * (82)
V,, commutes with all operators the expectation values of which have been calculated above (P, &, K,,, K,,, ).
Thus, the exchange interaction does not contribute to K;, in the first-order approximation. All the KI, operators
considered above imply the multiplication by Qo and those combinations of nuclear spin operators with which
V,, commutes. Thus, the contribution of V,, in the second-order approximation is defined by the commutator
[Qo, Vex]:
K&i,--ifi-‘[KI,, Vex]cc[Qo,S,&]=-a. (83)
The expectation value of Qo is zero. The exchange interaction contributes only in the third-order approximation
to the measurable quantities mentioned above ( (Kg ) # 0). Unlike CIDNP the exchange interaction should
not be neglected in the CIDEP calculations based on the RP mechanism. It is known [ 1 ] that only the consid-
eration of the exchange interaction leads to the correct explanation of CIDEP in high magnetic fields.
4.4. Electron spin polarization
4.4.1. Net effe
The RP with a few coupling nuclei in each radical is considered. With the exchange interaction the Hamilto-
nian takes the form
(84)
The anisotropic part of H is similar to that in eq. (76). First the average of the Zeeman electron spin energy
(see eq. ( 10) ) of the radical R for the particular nuclear spin configuration {Zkz}i s calculated. In the second-
order approximation we have

where the upper sign is attributed to the case of R=A and the lower to R=B. ESR line polarization is obtained
after taking the trace over the nuclear spin states of the partner. For the radical A, e.g., we get

After the summation of the polarizations of all ESR lines the net polarization results in

From eq. (87 ) the sign rule for net polarization can be derived:

The contributions of the anisotropic interactions occur only in the fourth order. The terms having nonzero
expectation values at t= 0 have the form

4.4.2. Multiplet efect
The multiplet effect is defined by the hfi energy. The corresponding operator for radical R is

In the derivation of eqs. (85 )-( 93 ) the exchange interaction was assumed to be a quantity fluctuating with
time. Yet there is a complex dependence on the distance and the mutual orientations of the two radicals.
Obviously, the isotropic interactions are of most importance for CIDEP origination. They give the most ef-
fective contribution to the polarization during the RP lifetime. For free radicals the importance of relaxation
processes increases. In ref. [ 23 ] cross relaxation processes were described, in which the polarization of electron
spins or its change of sign is caused by a nuclear polarization transfer.
