Abstract: With the development of magnet
technology, the potential impacts of
magnetic fields on human health have
caused increasing concerns. On the other
hand, although permanent magnets have
been used in magnetotherapy a long time
ago, their effectiveness has always been
debated. This is partially due to the
discrepancy in reported static magnetic
field (SMF) bioeffects, as well as an
incomplete understanding about the
underlying physical and biological
mechanisms. Fortunately, recent
conceptual and technological advances
have revealed that the previously reported
inconsistencies are mainly caused by
experimental setup variations, such as
magnetic field type, strength, distribution,
treatment procedure as well as magnetic
properties of various biological samples.
The purpose of this book is to review
current scientific evidence and summarize
the emerging topic about the effects of
SMFs on biological samples ranging from
single molecules, subcellular

--- Page 6 ---

compartments, cells to whole organisms.
We will also summarize reported effects of
SMFs on cancer, the immune and nervous
system, bone and diabetes, etc. We realize
that the ambiguities in this field can be
resolved, or at least much reduced by
combining advanced techniques and
concepts in interdisciplinary research, as
well as standardized double-blind
experiments and data analysis. These will
not only help clarify most dilemmas in this
field, achieve a better understanding of the
underlying mechanisms, but also enable
future rational design and applications of
SMFs in clinical diagnosis and therapy.

1.1 Introduction
Generally speaking, magnetobiology is the study of interaction between
magnetic field (MF) and biological systems, which includes but not limited to the
magnetic field-induced bioeffects and mechanisms, perception, and utilization of
magneticfieldsbyorganisms,aswellasmagneticfieldrelatedtechnologies.Itisa
multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary area that involves biology, physics, and
chemistry(Fig.1.1),whichhasmadeatremendousprogressinthepastfewdecades.
Depending on whether the magnetic intensity changes over time, MFs can be
divided into static magnetic field (SMF) or time-varying magnetic field (TVMF)/
dynamicmagneticfield(DMF),whichcanbefurtherdividedintodifferentcatego-
riesaccordingtotheirfrequencyandotherparameters.Dependingonthemagnetic
fieldintensity,thereareweak,moderate,strong(high),andultra-strong(ultra-high)
magnetic fields. Depending on the spatial distribution, there are homogeneous or
inhomogeneousMFs.Thisbookfocusesonthebiologicaleffectsofstaticmagnetic
field, which does not change the magnetic field intensity, direction, or distribution
overacertainperiodoftime.Herewewilldiscussthemajorvariationsinmagnetic
fieldparametersandtheirdifferentialeffectsonbiologicalobjects.

1.2 Magnetic Field Parameters That Influence Bioeffects
1.2.1 Static Magnetic Field vs. Time-Varying Magnetic Field
It is obvious that cells and living organisms respond very differently to
SMFsvs.TVMFs.Multipleevidenceshowedthatdifferenttypesofmagneticfields
of the same intensity could produce totally different effects on the same biological
samples. For example, 0.4 mT 50 Hz and a 2 μT 1.8 GHz pulsed magnetic fields
(PMFs) both increased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation,
whichwerereversedbyincoherent(“noise”)MFofthesameintensities(Wangetal.
2010; Li et al. 2012). Our group has also reported that the cellular ATP levels in
multiplecelllinesweredifferentiallyaffectedbythe6mTmagneticfieldswith0Hz,
50Hz,and120Hz(Wangetal.2018).
This book only focuses on SMFs because they have much fewer variable
parameters and do not cause electric current or heat effects. Therefore, they have
obvious advantages in basic research compared to time-varying magnetic fields.
However, it should be pointed out that people are actually exposed to much more
time-varying magnetic fields in everyday life, such as the 50 Hz or 60 Hz power
frequency alternating current (AC) MFs from the power line, and radiofrequency
MFsfromcellphones.Ontheotherside,peoplehavealsosuccessfullydevelopeda
time-varyingmagneticfield-basedFDA-approvedmedicaldevice,transcranialmag-
netic stimulation (TMS), that can be used to treat depression and other medical
conditions. The low frequency rotating MFs have also shown great medical
potentials.
1.2.2 Different Magnetic Flux Density
According to the magnetic flux density, SMFs used in the biological effect studies
couldbeclassifiedasweak(<1mT),moderate(1mT–1T),high(1–20T),andultra-
high (20 T and above). It should be mentioned that the standard for defining the
threshold of each category is different in various field. For example, for MRI
(magnetic resonance imaging), people usually consider SMF higher than 5 T as
ultra-high.

1.2.2.2 ModerateandHighSMFs(1mT–20T)

magnets, such as the magnets on refrigerators, toys, and accessories, which are
usuallynotverystrong(below1T),unlesstheyarefabricated afterspecialdesign.
In addition, the core component of the MRI machines in most hospitals provides
SMFswithfieldintensitiesusuallyrangebetween0.5and3T.Becauseofthepublic
sensitivity,thequestionofthepossibleeffectsofSMFsof0.5–9.4T,therangeofthe
MRI machines in current hospitals and clinical research, on human health is of
paramountinterest.TheMRIprocessinvolvesacombinationofhomogenousSMF,
gradient SMF, and pulsed radiofrequency magnetic fields. Currently, the MRI
scanners are considered to be safe if used properly. Studies show that 7 T ultra-
highfieldMRIiswelltoleratedbyhumanswithoutexcessivediscomfort(Miyakoshi
2006; Simko 2007; Heilmaier et al. 2011), DNA damage (Fatahi et al. 2016), or
other cellular abnormalities (Sakurai et al. 1999). At the same time, since stronger
magnetscouldgivebetterresolutionandmoredetectionpossibilities,theresearchers
andengineersarecontinuouslyinvestigatingonMRImachineswithstrongerSMFs.

1.2.2.3 Ultra-HighStaticMagneticFields(>20T)
Duetotechnicallimitations,thebiologicaleffectsofstrongfieldof≥20Thavenot
beensystematicallyinvestigateduntilrecentfewyears.Althoughtheultra-highfield
NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) machines currently available can generate
around 20 T SMFs, they have very narrow bore size that is impractical to accom-
modate cell culture plates. In addition, the animal and human cells need to be
cultured with accurate temperature, humidity, and gas control, which make the
NMR machines unsuitable to do these experiments. For the limited number of
large-bore SMF equipment that can generate ≥20 T ultra-high SMFs, they are
mostly used for material science and physical science studies. People need to
construct special sample holders to make these magnets appropriate to study bio-
logical samples such as animal and human cells, as well as other small animal
models.
Inthepastfewyears,wehaveconstructedaseriesofincubationsystemtomatch
the large-bore ultra-high magnets. They can provide accurate temperature and gas
control for cell cultures and small animals, which enabled us to perform cellular
(Zhang et al. 2017b; Tao et al. 2020) and animal studies (Tian et al. 2018, 2019,

1.2.2.4 MagneticFluxDensity-InducedDifferences
Numerous studies have shown that the magnetic flux density is a key factor that
causesthebioeffectdifferences.Moreover,thedifferentmagneticfluxdensitiesand
theireffectsonbiologicalsamplesneedtobeexaminedcasebycase.
In many cases, SMFs with higher flux density could generate stronger pheno-
types, or phenotypes that are not inducible by SMFs of lower flux density. For
example,erythrocytes(redbloodcells,RBCs)couldbealignedbySMFswiththeir
diskplanesparalleltotheSMFdirectionandtheorientationdegreewasdependent
on SMF intensity (Higashi et al. 1993). Specifically, 1 T SMF had only detectable
alignment effect on erythrocytes while 4 T high SMF induced almost 100% align-
ment (Higashi et al. 1993). Moreover, Prina-Mello et al. reported that the p-JNK
levelwasincreasedinratcorticalneuroncellsafterexposureto2Tand5TSMFs
butnottheweakerSMFsof0.1–1T(Prina-Melloetal.2006).Inaddition,ourlab
recently showed that the human nasopharyngeal cancer CNE-2Z cell and human
colon cancer HCT116 cell proliferation could be inhibited by SMFs in a magnetic
field intensity dependentmanner (Zhang et al. 2016). Specifically, 1 TSMF expo-
surefor3daysreducedCNE-2ZandHCT116cellnumberby~15%and9TSMF
for3daysreducedtheircellnumberbyover30%.Incontrast,0.05TSMFdidnot
havesignificanteffectsonthesetwocells(Zhangetal.2016).Okanoetal.foundthat
moderate intensity gradient SMF of 0.7 T (Bmax) significantly reduced the nerve
conductionvelocity offrog nerve Cfibers butgradientSMFof0.21T(Bmax)did
not(Okanoetal.2012).Ourrecentfindingsshowedthat1–9Tmoderateandstrong
magnetic fields can affect EGFR orientation to inhibit it activity and cancer cell
growth while weaker SMFs cannot (Zhang et al. 2016). In addition, we found that
27 T ultra-strong SMF can affect spindle orientations in cells while moderate
intensitySMFscannot(Zhangetal.2017b).
Although multiple studies show that some biological effects are directly corre-
lated with the SMF intensity in a linear relationship and the higher magnetic field
intensities are frequently associated with stronger phenotypes (Bras et al. 1998;
Takashima et al. 2004; Glade and Tabony 2005; Guevorkian and Valles Jr. 2006),
therearealsostudiesshowingthatSMFsofdifferentdensitymayhavedifferentor
even opposite biological effects compared to lower SMFs. For example, Ghibelli
etal.showedthat6mTSMFhadananti-apoptoticactivity,but1TSMFpotentiated
theapoptoticeffectsofsmallmolecules(Ghibellietal.2006).Morrisetal.showed
that application of a 10 or 70 mT, but not a 400 mT, SMF for 15 or 30 min

1.2.3 Homogeneous vs. Inhomogeneous Magnetic Field
Dependingonthespatialdistributionofmagneticfields,SMFscanbeclassifiedas
homogeneous (uniform) SMF and inhomogeneous (gradient) SMF, in which the
fieldstrengthcanbespatiallyconstantordifferent.Inmostcases,bothhomogeneous
and inhomogeneous MFs are present in the same system. For the electromagnets
designed for SMFs, the center of the magnet usually can provide a homogeneous
magneticfield,aslongasthesamplesareplacedwithinacertainrange.However,if
thesamplesareplacedfarawayfromthecenter,themagneticfieldusuallybecomes
inhomogeneous. For example, although the center of the MRI machine has a
homogeneous magnetic field, MRI workers who stand step away from the MRI
machines receive an inhomogeneous (gradient) SMF. SMFs generated by most
permanentmagnetsareinhomogeneous.
Hereweshowthemagneticfluxdensitydistributionsonthesurfacesof4different
permanentmagnetsinourlabtoshowthediversity(Fig.1.5).Evenforarectangular-
shapedmagnetthatproducesanevenlydistributedfluxdensityattheXYdirection
parallel to the magnet surface (Fig. 1.5a, b), there is still a gradient along the Z/
verticaldirection.
The magnetic forces used in magnetic levitation belong to the inhomogeneous
SMFs. The magnetic flux density decreases along the upward direction away from
thecentersothattheforcescanpointtotheupwarddirectiontobalancegravity.The
magnetic force acting on diamagnetic object is repulsive and if it is stronger than
gravity, the object will be levitated. The famous “flying frog” used a 16 T
superconducting magnet that provided a SMF with a gradient that is large enough
tobalancethegravityofthefrogwhenitwasplacedattheupperpartofthemagnet,
away from the center (Fig. 1.6). Apparently, magnetic levitation can only be
achieved in inhomogeneous SMFs, but not in pulsed magnetic fields or homoge-
neousSMFs.
Besides the flying frog, there is another excellent example of using magnetic
levitation to “fly” much smaller living objects, single cells. In 2015, Durmus et al.

SMF homogeneousness often can directly impact the biological effects. This is
notsurprisingbecausethemagneticforceactingonanyparticularobjectispropor-
tionaltothemagneticfluxdensity,fieldgradient,andthemagneticsusceptibilityof
the object. Magnetic fields with low or no field gradients can be used to induce a
magnetic torque, rather than a magnetic force, which act on magnetic objects to
move them along magnetic gradients. For example, Kiss et al. compared the
homogeneous and inhomogeneous SMFs generated by permanent magnets and
found that although both homogeneous and inhomogeneous SMFs of moderate
intensity can significantly reduce pain in mice, the spatial SMF gradient might be

1.2.4 Exposure Time
People are exposed to increasing amount of electromagnetic radiation these days
from multiple sources, such as mobile phones and power lines, whose effects on
human health are still debated. One of the constricting factors is that long-term
exposureeffectsarelacking.Incontrast,thehumanexposuretomostSMFs,except
forearthmagneticfield,isonlyforalimitedtime.Forexample,thedurationofthe
MRIexaminationsinhospitalsislessthananhour.Evenforpeoplewhoworkwith
MRI, the exposure time is relative limited. So far there are no known detrimental
effectsofrepetitiveMRIexposureonhumanbodies,aslongastheyfollowtheMRI
instructions.Long-termSMFeffectsarediscussedinChap.14ofthisbook,which
summarizesexperimentaldataonanimalsandhumansthatweresubjectedtoSMFs
formorethan2weeks,eithercontinuouslyorintermittently.
It has been demonstrated by multiple studies that exposure time is a key factor
that contributes to the differential effects of magnetic fields on biological samples.
For example, in 2003, Chionna et al. found that human lymphoma U937 cells
exposed to 6 mT SMF showed cell surface microvilli shape change after 24 h
exposure, but they have distorted cell shape after longer exposure (Chionna et al.
2003).In2005,Chionnaetal.foundthatcytoskeletonwasalsomodifiedinatime-
dependent manner in human liver cancer HepG2 cells exposed to 6 mT SMF
(Chionnaetal.2005).In2008,Striethetal.foundthatprolongationoftheexposure

red blood cell velocity and functional vessel density (Strieth et al. 2008). In 2009,

In 2011, Sullivan et al. found that ROS in fetal human lung fibroblast WI-38 cells
was significantly increased by 18 h of moderate intensity SMF exposure but not
5daysofexposure(Sullivanetal.2011)althoughtheunderlyingmechanismisstill
unknown. Also in 2011, Tatarov et al. tested the effect of 100 mT SMF on mice
bearingmetastaticbreasttumorEpH4-MEK-Bcl2cells.Theyfoundthatexposureof
themicetomagneticfieldsfor3hor6h,butnot1h,dailyforaslongas4weeks
suppressed tumor growth (Tatarov et al. 2011). In 2014, Gellrich et al. found that
although both SMF single exposure and repeated exposure increased the blood
vessel leakiness and reduced functional tumor microvessels, the repeated SMF
exposure had stronger effects (Gellrich etal. 2014). In2021, Zhaoet al.show that
a gradient SMF can increase the ROS levels in osteosarcoma stem cell 1 day after
exposure,butnot3or5days(Zhaoetal.2021).AllthesestudiesshowthattheSMF
exposure time is a key factor for their effects on biological systems and people

1.2.5 Magnetic Poles and Magnetic Field Directions
As we mentioned above, magnetic flux density, gradient, exposure time are all
important factors that contribute to the magnetic field-induced bioeffect variations.
However, most people would not pay much attention to the magnetic poles or
magneticfielddirection duringtheirresearch,whichactually caused alotofvaria-

because of the magnetic pole or magnetic field direction? Does magnetic field
direction affect all types of bioeffects? What are the underlying mechanisms?
More details can be found in Chap. 2 of this book, in which we summarize and
analyze all reported studies we can find to get answers to the above-mentioned
questions.

cause obvious changes in unicellular yeast (Anton-Leberre et al. 2010) but could
induce frog egg division alteration (Denegre et al. 1998). In 2011, Sullivan et al.
showed that moderate intensity (35–120 mT) SMF could affect attachment and
growth of human fibroblast cells as well as growth of human melanoma cells, but
notattachmentorgrowthofadultadiposestemcells(Sullivanetal.2011).In2013,
Vergallo et al. showed that inhomogeneous SMF (476 mT) exposure caused toxic
effectsonlymphocytesbutnotonmacrophages(Vergalloetal.2013).Thesestudies
allshowthatdifferentcelltypesrespondtoSMFsdifferently.
The different cellular effects of SMFs on various cell types may because these
cells were originated from different tissues. Since different tissues have totally
distinct biological functions and genetic background, it is not surprising that they
havedifferentresponsestoSMFexposure.However,evidencesshowthatevenfor
cellsfromthesametissue,theirresponsetothesameSMFcanbeverydifferent.For
example,theShanggrouphasmadeseriesofprogressesabouttheimpactofSMFs
ondifferenttypesofbonecells.Forexample,theynotonlyfoundthatthedifferen-
tiation and mineral elements can be differentially affected by low, moderate, and
ultra-highSMFs(Zhangetal.2014b)butalsofoundthatdifferenttypesofbonecells
haveobviouslydifferent cellularresponses.TheShanggroupcomparedtheeffects
of500nT,0.2T,and16TSMFsonosteoblastMC3T3-E1cells(Zhangetal.2014b)
and osteoclast differentiation from pre-osteoclast Raw264.7 cells (Zhang et al.
2017a). They found that both hypo and moderate SMFs reduced osteoblast differ-
entiation but promoted osteoclast differentiation, formation, and resorption. In
contrast,16ThighSMFincreasedosteoblastdifferentiationandinhibitedosteoclast
differentiation. Therefore, the osteoblast and osteoclast cells responded totally
opposite to these SMFs. Their studies revealed some parameters that could be
used as a physical therapy for various bone disorders. They also summarized the
effectsofSMFsonboneinaveryinformativereview(Zhangetal.2014a).
ItisinterestingthatmanystudiesindicatethatSMFscouldhaveinhibitoryeffects
on cancer cells but not non-cancer cells. For example, Aldinucci et al. found that
4.75 T SMF significantly inhibited Jurkat leukemia cell proliferation but did not
affectnormallymphomonocytes(Aldinuccietal.2003).Raymanetal.showedthat
growthofafewcancercelllinescanbeinhibitedby7TSMF(Raylmanetal.1996),
but a few other studies showed that even 10–13 T strong SMFs did not induce

human fibroblast cells (Nakahara et al. 2002; Zhao et al. 2010). These results
indicate that cell type is a very important factor that contributes to the differential
responses of cells to SMFs. Recently, we found that EGFR and its downstream
pathwayplaykeyrolesintheSMF-inducedcellproliferationinhibition.Ourresults
showedthatalthoughCHOcellsdidnotrespondtomoderate(1T)orstrong(9T)
SMFs, the transfected EGFR, but not the kinase-dead mutant of EGFR, could
convert the SMF-insensitive CHO cells into SMF-sensitive cells and their cell
growth could be inhibited by moderate and strong SMFs. Detailed mechanisms
willbediscussedinChap.9ofthisbook,whichfocusesonthepotentialapplication
ofSMFsincancertreatment.
Most individual studies so far have only investigated one or very few types of
cells, which isnot sufficient enough for people to comprehensively understand the
effectsofthemagneticfieldsoncells.Therefore,comparingdifferentcelltypesside-
by-side for their responses to the magnetic fields is strongly needed. In our recent
work, we compared 15 different kinds of cells, including human cells and some
rodentcellsfortheirresponsesto1TSMF.OurresultsconfirmedthatSMFscould
induce completely opposite effects in different cell types. However, since the
biologicalsystemsareverycomplicated,theknowledgewehaveisstillverylimited.
Morestudiesaredefinitelyneededforpeopletogetamorecompleteunderstanding
fortheeffectsofSMFsondifferenttypesofcells.
1.3.2 Cell Plating Density-Dependent Cellular Effects
of Static Magnetic Fields
We found that the cell density also played a very important role in SMF-induced
cellulareffects(Zhangetal.2017c).Weoriginallyfoundthisbyaccident,whenwe
wereinvestigatingtheeffectsof1TSMFonhumanCNE-2Znasopharyngealcancer
cell proliferation. We got diverse results when we plated the cells at different cell
densities. To verify this observation, we seeded CNE-2Z cells at 4 different cell
densitiesandexaminedthemside-by-side.Wefoundthatatlowercelldensity,1T
SMF treatment for 2 days did not inhibit CNE-2Z cell proliferation and there was
evenatendencyofincreasedcellnumberafterSMFtreatment.However,whenthe
cells were seeded at higher densities, it was interesting that 1 T SMF could
consistently inhibit CNE-2Z cell proliferation. These results demonstrate that cell
densitycandirectlyinfluencetheeffectof1TSMFonCNE-2Zcells.
We suspected that the cell density-induced variations must at least partly con-
tribute to thelack of consistencies in theliterature. Most researchers, including us,
did not really pay enough attention to the cell density before, or at least did not
realizethatthecelldensitycouldcausesuchdramaticvariationsintheexperimental
outcomes. However, it has been shown that cell density could directly cause
variations in cell growth rate, protein expression, alterations in some signaling
pathways (Macieira 1967; Holley et al. 1977; McClain and Edelman 1980;

as well as ROS levels (Fig. 1.9) (Wang and Zhang 2019). In fact, we also chose
6 other human cancer cell linesand found that for most of them, their cell number
could be reduced by 1 T SMF when seeded at higher densities, but not at lower
densities (Zhang et al. 2017c). This indicates that cell density could generally
influencetheimpactofSMFsonhumancancercelllines.
Then we further tested a few other non-cancer cell lines and found that cell
densitycoulddirectlyinfluencetheeffectsofSMFsontheirproliferationaswell.In
addition,thepatternisdifferentindifferentkindsofcells.Althoughthemechanism
isstillnotcompletelyunderstood,ourdatarevealedthatEGFRanditsdownstream
pathways might contribute to the cell type- and cell density-induced variations.
However, as mentioned above, since cell density can have multiple effects on
cells, such as calcium level (Carson et al. 1990) and signaling pathways, other
factors are likely to be involved. For example, in 2004, Ogiue-Ikeda and Ueno
foundthatalthoughA7r5cells(smoothmusclecells,spindleshaped)andGI-1cells
(humangliomacells,spindleshaped)couldorientinan8TSMF.Theyconcluded
thattheMFaffectedthecelldivisionprocess,andonlytheproliferatingcellsathigh

interestingthattheorientationdidnotoccurwhenthecellswereundertheconfluent

Apparently,furtheranalysisisneededtounravelthecompletemechanismsofcell
density-dependent variations in SMF-induced cellular effects. Before we have a
clear understanding of the molecular mechanisms, people should always pay extra
attentiontothecelldensityintheirownstudies,aswellasinliteraturereading.
1.3.3 Cell Status Influences the Cellular Effects of Static
Magnetic Fields
Besides the cell type and density, cell status can also affect the cellular effects of
SMFs. For example, in RBCs, the hemoglobin conditions can directly affect the
magneticpropertiesofthewholecell.InnormalRBCs,thehemoglobinisoxygen-
ated and the cell is diamagnetic. In fact, they are slightly more diamagnetic than
water because of the diamagnetic contribution of globin. However, when the cells
weretreatedwithisotonicsodiumdithionitetomakethehemoglobinindeoxygen-
atedreducedstateortreatedwithsodiumnitritetooxidizethehemoglobin(methe-
moglobin), the RBCs would become paramagnetic. Back in 1975, Melville et al.
directly separated RBCs from whole blood using a 1.75 T SMF (Melville et al.
1975).In1978,Owenuseda3.3TSMFwithhighgradienttoseparateRBCs(Owen
1978).TheparamagneticmethemoglobincontainingRBCscouldbeseparatedfrom
diamagnetic untreated RBCs as well as diamagnetic leukocytes (white blood cells,
WBCs) (Owen 1978). In fact, “magnetophoresis” has been applied in RBC, called
RBC magnetophoresis, which uses an applied magnetic field to characterize and
separatethecellsbasedontheintrinsicandextrinsicmagneticpropertiesofbiolog-
ical macromolecules in these cells (Zborowski et al. 2003; Moore et al. 2013). In
2013, Moore et al. designed an open gradient magnetic RBC sorter and tested on
label-freecellmixtures(Mooreetal.2013).Theyshowedthatintheopengradient
magneticRBCsorter,theoxygenatedRBCswerepushedawayfromthemagnetand
the deoxygenated RBCs were attracted to the magnet. Moreover, the effect for the
oxygenatedRBC’swasveryweakandcomparabletothatofothernon-RBCcellsin
the blood, which do not contain hemoglobin and could be considered as
non-magnetic. Theyproposedthat thequantitative measurements ofRBCmobility
incellsuspensionwerethebasisforengineeringdesign,analysis,andfabricationof
a laboratory prototype magnetic RBC sorter built from commercially available,
block permanent magnets to serve as a test bed for magnetic RBC separation
experiments(Mooreetal.2013).
Another well studied example of cells with different magnetic property is
malaria-infectedRBCs.Researchershaveutilized malariabyproduct,hemozoin,to
study and separate malaria-infected RBCs in a magnetic field gradient (Paul et al.
1981;Mooreetal.2006;Hackettetal.2009;Kasetsirikuletal.2016).Duringintra-
erythrocytic maturation, malaria trophozoites could digest up to 80% of cellular
hemoglobin,whichaccumulatestoxicheme.Topreventhemeironfromparticipat-

high-spin ferriheme, whose magnetic properties were studied a long time ago
(Pauling and Coryell 1936). In fact, in 2006, Moore et al. used magnetophoretic
cellmotion analysis toprovidedirectevidenceforagraduated increaseoflivecell
magneticsusceptibility withdevelopingblood-stageparasites,whichiscompatible
withhemozoinincrease(Mooreetal.2006).In2009,Hackettetal.experimentally

Theyfoundthattheparasitesconvertedapproximately60%ofhostcellhemoglobin

recovery rate of around 98.3%. Early-stage infected RBCs had been difficult to
separate due to their low paramagnetic characteristics but can also be successfully
separatedwitharecoveryrateof73%.Therefore,itcouldprovideapotentialtoolfor
malarial-relatedstudies(Nametal.2013).
Besides the cell status mentioned above, the cell lifespan or cell age can also
influence SMF-induced cellular effects. In 2011, Sullivan et al. found that various
points during the lifespan of fetal human lung fibroblast WI-38 cells affected the
cellularresponsestomoderateintensitySMF(Sullivanetal.2011).SMFexposure
decreasedcellattachmentbylessthan10%inyoungercultures(populationdoubling
level 29) but can decrease cell attachment by more than 60% in older cultures
(population doubling level 53). In 2004, Ogiue-Ikeda and Ueno found that the
smooth muscle A7r5 cells could be aligned along an 8 T magnetic field direction
onlywhenthecellswereactivelyproliferatingatahigherdensity(Ogiue-Ikedaand
Ueno 2004). In addition, in 2014 Surma et al. also found that fully differentiated
myotubes at late stages of development were less sensitive to weak SMF and
myotubes at the stage when electromechanical coupling was forming dramatically
reduced the contraction frequency during the first minute’s weak SMF exposure
(Surmaetal.2014).Theseresultsdemonstratethatevenforthesamecelltypeand

lifespan. The underlying mechanisms are still unknown and need to be further
investigated.
1.4 OtherFactorsContributingtotheLackofConsistencies
in Bioeffect Studies of Magnetic Fields
The above-mentioned parameters, including magnetic flux density, cell types, cell
plating density, and cell status, are just a few examples that directly influence the
cellular effects of SMFs. It is very likely that other aspects of cell status also
contributetothedifferentialeffectsofSMFoncells.Therearemultipleotherfactors
that complicate the situation, such as magnetic field exposure time, direction,
gradient,etc. InterestedreaderscanlookintoourChap.1formore information. In
the meantime, we recommend researcher in this field to provide as detailed infor-
mationaspossibleabouttheirexperimentalsetupaswellasthebiologicalsamples,
which will help us to understand better of the cellular effects of SMFs. Further
investigationsatbothcellularandmolecularlevelsareneededtogetacomprehen-
siveunderstanding.
Asmentionedabove,despitethenumerousscientificresearchandnon-scientific
case reports about the magnetic effects on living organisms, the magnetic field
effects on biological systems are still looked upon with doubts and suspicion by
many scientistsoutside ofthe field, as well as by the mainstream medical commu-
nity.Thisislargelyduetoalackofconsensusonthebiologicaleffectsingeneralthat
arebackedupbysolidscientificevidencesandexplanations.Wehavetoadmitthat
thecountlessscientificresearchornon-scientificcasereportsareenrichedwithmany
seemingly contradictory results, which make many people confused and hence
become suspicious, including myself a few years ago. Then we carefully analyzed
theevidenceintheliteratureaboutthebiologicaleffectsofmagneticfieldstotryto
view them collectively in a scientific way. We found that most of these inconsis-
tenciescanbeexplainedbythedifferentparametersofeitherthemagneticfieldsor
thebiologicalsamplespeopleusedinindividualstudies.Forexample,themagnetic
field parameters mentioned above in this chapter all contribute to the differential
effects,suchasthetypesofmagneticfields,thefieldintensitiesandfrequencies,the
homogeneityanddirectionsoftheMFs,themagneticpoles,andtheexposuretime.
More importantly, we found that the biological samples people examined directly
affectthemagneticeffects.Forexample,bothcelltypesandcelldensitieshavedirect
impact on the effects of 1 T SMF on cells (Zhang et al. 2017c). The Shang group
comparedtheeffectsof500nT,0.2T,16TonosteoblastMC3T3-E1cells(Zhang
etal.2014b),aswellaspre-osteoclastRaw264.7cells(Zhangetal.2016)andfound
that theosteoblast andosteoclastcellsresponded totally oppositely tothese SMFs.
Both hypo and moderate magnetic fields reduced osteoblast differentiation but
promoted osteoclast differentiation, formation, and resorption. In contrast, 16 T
SMF increased osteoblast differentiation inhibited osteoclast differentiation. They

also wrote a particular review to systematically summarize the effects of SMFs on
bonethatisworthtolookinto(Zhangetal.2014a).Moresurprisingly,somepeople
(including ourselves) found that even cell passage number could affect the experi-
mentalresults.
It should also be mentioned that, theoretically, if two magnetic devices both
provideSMFsofsameparameters,includingfluxdensity,gradient,anddistribution,
thereshouldbenodifferencesbetweenthem,ortheireffectsonbiologicalsystems.
However, by analyzing the differential effects in the literature about SMF-induced
effects on reproductive development, we found that different types of magnetic
devicesoften cause differential bioeffects (Song etal. 2022).Specifically, it seems
that some electromagnetic fields may have induced bioeffects because of
nonnegligible gradient, heat effect, and minor 50/60 Hz ripple, which are much
reducedinsuperconductingmagnets.Theheateffectandminor50/60Hzripplecan
becompletelyavoidedbypermanentmagnets.
In 2009, Colbert et al. wrote a comprehensive review “Static Magnetic Field
Therapy: A Critical Review of Treatment Parameters” (Colbert et al. 2009). Their
purpose was to summarize SMF studies involving the application of permanent
magnetsinhumans.Inthisreview,theycriticallyevaluatedthereportingqualityof
10essentialSMFdosingandtreatmentparametersandproposedasetofcriteriafor
reporting SMF treatment parameters in future clinical trials (Fig. 1.12). They
reviewed 56 studies about magnetic therapy, in which 42 studies were done in
patient populations and 14 studies were done in healthy volunteers. As we have
discussed in earlier part of this Chapter, the magnetic field parameters greatly
influence their effects on biological systems. However, by analyzing 10 magnetic

duration of application, site of application, magnet support device, target tissue,
distance from magnet surface, and found that 61% of the studies failed to provide
enough experimental details about the SMF parameters to permit protocol replica-
tionbyotherinvestigators.
Moreover,therearealsosomeotherfactorscontributingtothesedifferences,such
as instrument and technical sensitivities, which have been greatly improved in the
past few decades. Nowadays, people have much advanced instruments and tech-
niques, which should enable more findings that were not detectable before. The
absence of magnetic field effects in some studies may simply due to the technical
limitations and/or inadequate control of experimental conditions. We should take
advantageofthemoderntechnologiestoanswerrelatedquestions.Forexample,we
recently used liquid-phase scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to gethigh reso-
lution single molecular images of proteins (Wang et al. 2016) and combined with
biochemistry, cell biology as well as molecular dynamics simulation to reveal that
moderateandstrongSMFscould change EGFRorientation toinhibititsactivation
andsomecancercellgrowth(Zhangetal.2016).
Atthesametime,weshouldkeepallrelevantfactorsinmind,suchasmagnetic
field type and intensity, cell type, and density when we do our own research and
analyzetherelevantliterature.Apparently,thelackofsufficientlydetaileddescrip-
tion of SMF parameters greatly prevented people from getting consensus conclu-
sionsfromthesestudies.Westronglyencouragepeopleinthefieldofmagneticfield
studies to clearly state their experimental details in their own research (Table 1.1).
Thiswillhelpusreducethediversityandcontradictionsinthisfieldandalsohelpus
to correctly understand the mechanism of the biological effects caused by the
magneticfield.

other labs. Other than the previous mentioned factors in this chapter, the experi-
menter bias is almost always sub-conscious, but is considered to be a significant
contributingfactortotheproblemsofreproducibilityinthisareaofscience.There-
fore,toremoveexperimenterbiasandthusmeetthegoldstandardforassessingthe
effects of magnetic fields on biological systems, the person analyzing the data
shouldn’t be aware of the exposure conditions. In another word, blinded analysis
shouldbeperformed.Moreover,togetunbiasedandreproducibleresults,ourgroup
have always tried to minimize experimental variations by doing the same sets of
experiments for more than three times by at least two different researchers. They
performedtheexperimentsindependently,andtheirresultswerepooledtogetherfor
blindedanalysis.
1.5 Conclusion
Sincethehumanbodyitselfisanelectromagneticobject,itisnotsurprisingthatthe
magnetic fields could produce some effects. There are indeed many convincing
experimental evidences as well as theoretical explanations about the effects of
magneticfieldonsomebiomolecules,suchasthecytoskeletonmicrotubules,mem-
brane,aswellassomeproteins(willbediscussedinChaps.3–6).Inthemeantime,
moststudiesintheliterature onthebiological andhealtheffectsofmagneticfields
had been inconclusive or contradictory, which was largely due to the various
parameters used in individual studies, including the magnet fields themselves,
samples examined, as well as the experimental setup. It seems that there is a large
gapbetweenatom/molecularlevelandcell/tissue/organismlevelthatpeopleneedto
fill in to correctly and scientifically understand the biological effects of magnetic
field. For now, experimental and theoretical studies are both at a very preliminary
stage. To help us get a more complete understanding of the biological effects of
magneticfieldsandtheirunderlyingmechanisms,moresystematic,wellcontrolled
and fully described experimental details are strongly encouraged. Furthermore,
increased collaborations between scientists in physics, biology, and chemists are
necessarytomakesubstantialprogressesinthisemergingfield.

Static Magnetic Field Direction-Induced
Differential Biological Effects
BiaoYuandXinZhang
Abstract Althoughlackingmechanisticexplanations,differentpolesofpermanent
magnets could generate different effects on living organisms has been claimed
decades ago, especially in the field of magnetotherapy. In recent years, several
studies haveconfirmedthatdifferentmagneticfielddirectionscould indeedinduce
some differential effects in biological systems, including tumor inhibition, blood
glucose level regulation, etc. However, it has been a neglected factor by most
researchers in the past, which has led to many inconsistent experimental results in
the literature. This chapter aims to systematically compare and summarize the
biological effects induced by static magnetic fields of different directions. We also
discussaboutthepossiblemechanisms,whichcurrentlyisstilllargelyamystery.We
hoperesearchersinthisfieldcanpayattentiontothestaticmagneticfielddirections
sothattheycanclearlydescribethefielddirectionand/ordistributionsinformationin
theirstudies,whichwillhelpclarifysomeconfusionsandreduceinconsistenciesfor
futureinvestigations.

differential bioeffects have been neglected by most researchers in this field. How-
ever,thedifferentpolesofpermanentmagnetshavebeenfrequentlybroughtupby
people in magnetotherapy for their observed differences. However, the scientific
experimentalvalidationsortheoreticalexplanationsarebothlackinguntilrecentfew
years. In this chapter, we will summarize reported studies in the literature, which
have demonstrated that static magnetic field (SMF) direction is indeed a very
important reason that has caused many experimental inconsistencies in
MF-inducedbioeffects.
2.2 Magnetic Poles vs. Magnetic Field Directions
There are some reports in the magnetotherapy field stating that different poles of a
permanent magnet would have differential effects on human bodies. The most
famous claim was brought up by Dr. Albert Roy Davis and Walter C. Rawls Jr.,
who published a very interesting book “Magnetism and its effects on the living
systems” in 1974. In this book, they claimed that the North (N) pole and South
(S) pole of the magnet could have dramatically different effects on living systems.
According to their book, the original finding was actually from an “earthworm
incident” in 1936, in which the earthworms had eaten through the one side of the
cardboardcontainerneartheSpolewhiletheearthwormsintheothercontainernear
N pole did not. The magnetic flux density was around 3000 Gauss (0.3 T) in this
“earthwormincident.”FurtheranalysisrevealedthattheearthwormsneartheSpole
were “one-third larger, longer in length and larger in diameter and were extremely
active.” In this book, they also described many interesting findings about the
differential effects of N vs. S magnetic pole on biological processes, such as the
ripen speed of green tomatoes, radish seed germination, small animals, as well as
cancers.Overall,theythinktheNpoleisthe“negativeenergypole,”whicharrests
lifegrowthand/ordevelopment,whiletheSpoleisthe“positiveenergy pole”that
increases growth and development. Although their claims have not been scientifi-
cally proven, there are many other no-scientific reports supporting the Davis and
Rawls’sclaims.However,sincenoillustration,pictureorotherdatawasprovidedin
theirbookabouttheseexperiments,therelativelocationsoftheearthwormsorother
samplestheytestednearthemagnetsareunclear.Notmuchexperimentaldetailsare
availableeither.
After reading this interesting but puzzling book, we have a lot of questions in
mind. Does the magnetic pole really matter for living organisms? If it does, is it
really because of the “magnetic pole” per se, or it is because of the magnetic field
direction? Does the North or South pole magnet could generate the same effects
whentheywereplacedonthetopvs.bottom,oratthesideofthesamples?DoesMF
directionaffectsomespecificaspectofbiologicalactivities?
Apparently, to answer these questions, it is necessary to perform carefully
designedandwellcontrolledstudiestotesttheirclaims.Forexample,inaprevious
study done by our group in 2018, we set up the experiments to expose cells to
0.2–0.5TSMFsbyfacingdifferentmagneticpolestothecellstoprovidedifferent

magnetic poles (Fig. 2.1). The surface magnetic flux density of the neodymium
permanentmagnetsweusedintheexperimentsis~0.5T,withtheNorSpolefacing
different directions. The “N-down” means that the N pole is at the bottom of the
sample.Andthe“S-up”meansthattheSpoleisatthetopofthesample.Therefore,
the “N-down” and “S-up” both provided vertically upward SMF direction
(Fig. 2.1a). The “N-up” and “S-down” both provided vertically downward SMF

by-side (Fig. 2.1d, e). We found that the cell numbers were reduced after 2-day
treatment of upward direction SMFs, but not by downward direction SMFs in two
lung cancer cell lines, A549 and PC9 cells (Tian et al. 2018). This confirms that
differentSMFdirectionsindeedhavedistinctcellulareffects.However,therewasno

field direction, but not the magnetic pole that generates differences on biological
samples,atleastforthistypeofcellularexperiments.
2.3 Bioeffects Induced by Different Magnetic Poles/Field
Directions
We did a thorough literature searching to answer the question about whether
different magnetic poles/field directions can really induce different bioeffects.
Moststudies wefoundweredoneinthelast10years, including theonesfromour
group. Here we summarize and analyze all published studies we can find that
involved SMFs of different directions (or magnetic poles) at organism level
(Table. 2.1) or cellular level (Table. 2.2). Although it is clear that magnetic field
directioncanoftencausedifferentialeffectsonsomeaspectsoflivingorganism,no
explicitrulescanbeconcludedatcurrentstageyet.Itshouldalsobementionedthat
we didnotincludeSMF studies thatused asingleSMF direction intheirstudy,or
implantedmagnetsinanimalsinaspecificway,whichcannotprovideside-by-side
comparison between different magnetic poles/field directions. However, it is inter-
esting that all studies we found about SMF directions are vertically
upwardvs.downward.
2.3.1 Bioeffects of Different Direction Static Magnetic Fields
in Living Organisms
In recent few years, an increasing number of studies have been conducted to
investigate whether and how SMFs directions can affect living organisms, but the
resultsarenotveryconsistent.WesummarizeandcomparereportedresultsonSMFs
inupwardanddownwarddirectionsandclassifiedtheminto:“upward≠downward”
and “upward = downward” based on whether SMFs in upward and downward

and the investigated experimental indicators are very diverse, which led to a large
variation in these reports. However, it is interesting that there are multiple studies
indicating that the upward direction SMFs might have more beneficial effects than
thedownwarddirectionSMFs.Forexample,theupwarddirectionSMF(0.01–0.5T,
6 h/day, for 38 days) exposure inhibited GIST-T1 tumor growth in nude mice by
19.3% while the downward SMF did not produce significant effect (Tian et al.
2018).Moreover,Yangetal.foundthattheupward9.4TSMFfor88hsignificantly
inhibited A549 tumor growth (tumor growth inhibition = 41%), but not in the
downward9.4TSMF(Yangetal.2021).Furthermore,theupwardSMFtreatment
significantlyincreasedthedistancetraveledandaveragespeedofTenebrio(insects)
(Todorovic et al. 2013) and increased plant root growth in Arabidopsis young
seedlings(Jinetal.2019).
In contrast, there are also some studies indicating that the downward direction
SMFs improved the living organism status more significantly than in the upward
direction(Table.2.1).Forexample,threeseparatestudiesusedadownwardSMFof
~0.1 T to efficiently decrease blood glucose levels in T2D (Yu et al. 2021) and in
T1D mice (unpublished data), as well as effectively alleviatealcohol-induced liver
damage and lipid accumulation, and improve liver function (Song et al. 2021).
Meanwhile, our group also found that a ~0.1 T downward SMF improved the
multiple diabetic complications, but not in 0.1 T upward SMF (Yu et al. 2021)
(unpublished data). More specifically, two studies in spontaneously hypertensive
rats found that the anxious-like behavior (Tasic et al. 2021) and heart rate (Tasic
et al. 2017) could be improved by downward direction of 16 mT SMF, but not
upwardSMF. There are also a few other studies that investigated theinfluences of
different SMF directions on plants (Jin et al. 2019) and gut microbiota (Yu et al.
2021).
In the meantime, there are also 12 studies that show no significant difference
betweenupwardanddownwarddirectionSMFs.Forexample,16mT(Djordjevich
et al. 2012) and 128 mT (Milovanovich et al. 2016) SMF exposures altered the
hematological parameters and biological changes of Swiss Webster mice, but no
difference was induced by different SMF directions. San et al. found that the
thrombosis was significantly ameliorated in both upward and downward groups of
BALB/cmiceexposedto1.4–46mTSMFs(Sanetal.2001).
ThediscrepancyaboutthedifferenteffectsofSMFsdirectiononlivingorganisms
could be resulted from multiple aspects, including research subject, SMF devices
thatgenerateddifferentmagneticfluxdensityanddistributions(Fig.2.2),aswellas
experimental procedures, including exposure time and assay time-points. Further
systematicstudiesareneededtogetmorein-depthinformation.
2.3.2 BioeffectsofDifferentSMFDirectionsatCellularLevel
Similartolivingorganism,thecellularstudiesofSMFsofdifferentfielddirections
also produced seemingly inconsistent results, which is reasonable to some extent
because the cellular experiments have more variable parameters than that in vivo.

(LakeShore475DSPGaussmeter)
et al. 2018; Yang et al. 2020, 2021) and 3 of them reported that the downward

Therefore, as mentioned in Chap. 1 of this book, multiple details should be
consideredwhenperformingtheseSMFexperiments,includingthesampledistance
from the magnet surface, SMF flux density distribution, material composition and
dimension of the magnet, magnet polar configuration, and duration of magnet
application, etc. For example, as shown in Fig. 2.3, the magnetic flux densities at
1 mm from the surface of the three type magnets were 4700–4980 Gs, 4190–4890
Gs,and9630–10,330Gs,respectively;at5mmfromthesurfaceofthemagnets,the
magneticfluxdensitiesdropped to3520–3890Gs,2180–2450Gs,and4370–5120
Gs, respectively; at 10 mm from the surface of the magnets, the magnetic flux
densities further decreased to 2420–3090 Gs, 1050–1120 Gs, and 2120–2450
Gs. The differences inmagnetic flux densityand spatialSMF distribution arrange-
ment resulted in significant differences in the values of magnetic flux density.
Therefore, people in this field should start to accurately measure their SMFs by
using a magnet analyzer, which can provide accurate 3D information about the
magneticfluxdensityanddistributions(Fig.2.3).
2.4 Possible Mechanisms
AsintroducedinChap.1,variousfactorscouldresultinthesedifferentialeffectsof
SMFinvivoandinvitro,includingSMFfluxdensity,gradient,exposuretime,cell
type,etc.Fromabove-mentionedanimalandcellularstudiesaboutSMFsofdifferent
directionsinthischapter,itisobviousthatthefielddirectionisalsoakeyfactorfor
somespecificbioeffects.Althoughthemechanismsbehindtheobservedresultsare
still not completely understood, there are some studies have tried to address them
andprovidedsomeimportantclues.
First of all, magnetic field can control the state of electrons, manipulate the
unpaired electrons in free radicals, which provides a theoretical basis for cellular
reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation by SMF (Timmel et al. 1999; Ikeya and
Woodward 2021). However, the exact effects of SMFs on cellular ROS levels are
highlyvariableindifferentstudies(WangandZhang2017),whichwillbesystem-
atically summarize in Chap. 6. Although some studies proposed that changed
cellular ROS formation can be affected by SMF directions (Sullivan et al. 2011;
Djordjevichetal.2012;DeLukaetal.2016;Milovanovichetal.2016;Naaralaetal.
2017;Tasicetal.2017,2021;Liuetal.2019;Songetal.2021;Yangetal.2021;Yu
etal.2021),thereisnophysicalexplanationforthisyet.Thisisprobablyduetothe
complexedROSgeneratingandclearingsysteminlivingorganismsandcells.
Secondly,thereisadifferencebetweenadherentcellsvs.suspendedcellsinSMF
direction-induced effects, probably due to shape anisotropy. Our previous study
indicated that the upward or downward SMFs had a significant effect on the cell
numberinmultipletypesofadherentcells,whilethereseemstobenodifferencefor
suspendedcellsintheliquidcellculturemedium(Tianetal.2018).Thisisprobably
duetothefactthatadherentcellsarefixedinpositionsothattheywillhaveashape
anisotropyanddirectionalpreference.Incontrast,suspendedcellsareroundinshape

and can rotate freely in the liquid medium, which make them independent of
directions.
Thirdly,DNAsynthesishasbeenshowntobedifferentiallyregulatedbySMFsof
differentdirections.SinceDNAisnegativelychargedandundergoesfastrotationto
get winding and unwinding during DNA replication in living cells, the externally
appliedSMF will affect theDNA movementthroughLorentz force. Wecombined
theoreticalcalculationandcellularexperimentstoshowthattheupwardanddown-
ward SMFs have differential effects on the DNA rotation and supercoil in cells
(Fig.2.4)(Yangetal.2020),whichresultedindifferentialeffectsonDNAsynthesis.
Specifically, the upward moderate to high SMFs can inhibit DNA synthesis by
Lorentz forces exerted on the negatively charged moving DNA (Yang et al. 2020,
2021).Thistheoryisactuallyconsistentwithotherresultsthathaveshownthecell
proliferationinhibitioneffectsofupwardSMFs(Zhangetal.2017;Tianetal.2018;
WangandZhang2019;Yangetal.2021).
Fourthly, there may be some link between these SMF direction-induced
bioeffectswiththeearthmagneticfield.Itisknownthattheearthmagneticfieldis
a quasi-SMF that is static for most of the time, but can be affected by solar storm.

needle represents ferromagnetic or paramagnetic components in living organisms that could
mediatemagneticfielddirection-inducedbioeffects
The directions of earth magnetic field at the southern hemisphere and northern
hemisphere are opposite. However, the earth magnetic field is much weaker than
the SMFs used in currently reported studies. Whether and how these factors are
linkedarecompletelyunknown.
Additionally,althoughthephysicalmechanismsaboutthedifferentialbioeffects
caused by SMFs of different directions are still lacking, there are some biological
experimental evidencesthatrevealedsomepotentialaspectsforpeople toinvestin
thefuture.Forexample,ourstudyshowsthattheironmetabolismwasdifferentially
affected by the upward vs. downward SMFs in diabetic mice. We found that the
~100mTSMFofadownwarddirectionalonecouldimprovepancreasfunctionby
regulating iron metabolism and ROS production. Meanwhile, the downward SMF,
but not the upward SMF, markedly restored the Bacteroidetes population and
reversedtheironcomplexoutermembranereceptorgenereductioninthemicegut
microbiota,andreducedirondepositioninthepancreas(Yuetal.2021).
Lastly,althoughthereisstillnoevidenceyet,wehypothesisthattheremightbe
some ferromagnetic or paramagnetic components in cells that behave like tiny
magnets, which will change direction when external SMF applies (Fig. 2.5). The
orientation of these components will trigger differential downstream signal trans-
duction pathways in cells and/or various cellular processes. However, since the
biological system is very complicated, we currently have only very limited infor-
mationaboutthemagnetismofmaterialsinsideourbodies,whichwillbereviewed
inthenextchapterofthisbook.Withthehelpofrecentlydevelopedtechniques,we
will be able to get a better understanding of the magnetism of biomolecules, cells,
andtissueinthenearfuture,whichisactuallyoneofthemainresearchfocusesofour

2.5 Summary and Future Perspectives
From current experimental evidences collected, we can conclude that it is the
magnetic field direction, but not the magnetic pole, that have induced differential
effects.Infact,itisclearthatmultiplestudieshavedemonstratedthatfielddirection

3.1 Introduction
A large number of magnetic field-induced bioeffects have been reported, but the

understand many different phenomena such as field-induced bioeffects and field-
relatedapplications.
Diamagnetic materials have negative χ, and their internal magnetic field is
oppositetotheexternallyappliedmagnetic field.In fact, theweak basic character-
isticofdiamagneticsubstancesisapropertyofallmaterials,whichiscausedbythe
non-cooperativebehavioroforbitalelectronswhenexposedtotheexternalmagnetic
field. There are paired electron spins in all diamagnetic materials. The paired spin
magnetic moments offset each other without contributing to the overall magnetic
moment, and the magnetic properties are only determined by the electric orbital
motion. However, when exposed to the external magnetic field, their angular
momentumandmagneticmomentswillchange,andthemagneticmomentscanno
longercompletely offseteachother,whichwillproduce anetmagnetizationoppo-
siteto,orresisting,theexternalmagneticfield.Therefore,themagneticsusceptibil-
ityisnegative.Currently,itiswellknownthatmostcomponentsinlivingorganisms
arediamagnetic,includingwater,lipid,andmostproteins.
Paramagnetic materials have positive χ, which is weakly magnetized along the
direction of the externally applied magnetic field. Paramagnetic materials include
some metals with free electrons, such as aluminum and platinum, as well as
moleculeswithunpairedelectrons.Althoughtheycanbeattracted bymagnets,but
theattractionisveryweak.Moreover,itshouldbementionedthatmetalionsarenot
ferromagneticintheirphysiologicalstate.Forinstance,ironinourhumanbodiesis
mostlycombinedwithhemoglobinintheblood,andsomeexistsinferritininorgans
including liver, spleen, and brain. There is also a small amount of iron in the
myoglobinofskeletalmuscle.
Ferromagnetic materials usually have large χ. When placed in an external mag-
neticfield,theferromagneticmaterialswillbemagnetized,whichremainevenafter
the external magnetic field has been removed. Currently, whether there are other
ferromagnetic materials in living organisms except for magnetosome in
magnetotacticbacteriaandironoxidesinsomecellsarestillunclear.

At37°C,themagneticsusceptibilityofwaterisabout-9.05×10 -6(SI)(Schenck
1996),whichmakesthelivingorganismsweaklymagneticasawhole.Althoughwe
have~40–50mg/kgofironinourbodies,itismostlyevenlyspreadsothatthewhole
humanbodyisstillweaklydiamagnetic.Nonetheless,sincethemetalions,aswellas
other paramagnetic and ferromagnetic substances can concentrated in some organs
and cells, which might result in different magnetism other than diamagnetism. It
should be noted that although different biological tissues have different magnetic
susceptibilities, the magnetic susceptibility of most tissues is about 20% higher or
lower than that of water (Schenck 1996). Therefore, although the human body
containsbothironandsomeotherparamagneticmetalions,itisoveralldiamagnetic.
Besides magnetic susceptibilities, since the intrinsic magnetic properties of bio-
logicalsamples,frombiomolecules,cells,totissuesandorgans,aredeterminednot
onlybytheircompositions,suchasparamagneticsubstancecontent,butalsobythe
substancedistributionandtheoverallstructures.Mostbiological samplesarecom-
plex, non-uniform, and unsymmetric, so that most of them have anisotropy of

magnetic susceptibility (AMS, or magnetic anisotropy), which is defined as
the difference in the magnetic susceptibility of a sample in different directions.
The magnetic anisotropy of biological samples is often assessed by measuring the
sample’svolumemagneticsusceptibilityinaxialandradialdirections,especiallyfor
rod-shaped samples. A difference in magnetic susceptibility values in the two
directions is considered to indicate that the sample has magnetic anisotropy, and
thisdifferenceisthemagneticanisotropy(Hongetal.1971).
It should be mentioned that some researchers have used international system of
units(SI)whileothersuseGaussiansystemofunits/CGSunits,whichhavecauseda
lot of inconvenience for people to compare between different studies. Here we list
the commonly used physical quantities in this field to help clarify the confusions
(Table 3.3). In this chapter, we try to unify the magnetic susceptibility data in the
literature into SI units and include them in the tables (Tables 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6).
However,duetotheincompleteinformationinsomereportedstudies,therearestill

DNA’smagnetismisintrinsicorextrinsicremainscontroversy.
In 1961, Muller and his colleagues discovered the high-concentration unpaired
electronsinphage(Muelleretal.1961).Asaconsequence,themagneticproperties
of DNA have attracted much attention. However, as it is difficult to exclude some
impuritiesotherthannucleicacid,suchassomemetalionsassociatedwithnucleic
acid, people failed to prove the magnetic properties were intrinsic to DNA (Kwon
etal.2009).In1961,Walshetal.statedthattheremightbeevidenceoftheexternal
origin of such magnetic properties. They detected spin signals of ferromagnetic
electrons in some DNA samples, determined that iron (Fe) was the main source of
suchsignalsbymeansofX-rayfluorescenceanalysis,andobservedtheexistenceof
ferromagnetic Fe O by electron microscope (Walsh et al. 1961). After Nakamae

at low temperature(Nakamae et al.2005),Mizoguchi andhis colleagues proposed
that oxygen molecules are possible external source of this paramagnetism
(Mizoguchietal.2006).
Besides iron, other factors also contribute to the unique magnetic property of
DNA.In2010,Omerzuetal.foundastrongelectronspinresonance(ESR)peakand
a strong electron transfer in the freeze-dried Zn-DNA (Omerzu et al. 2010). Zn2+
itselfisnotparamagnetic,whichmeansthattheESRsignalofZn-DNAcomesfrom
the unpaired electrons (Starikov 2003). Kwon et al. proposed that delocalized
electrons exist in Zn-DNA because the cations of Zn2+ replace H+ in hydrogen
bonds of complementary bases in the double helix structure of DNA (Kwon et al.
2009). In terms of theoretical research, Starikov used the extended Hubbard Ham-
iltonianmodeltocalculatetheroleofelectroncorrelationsindeoxyribonucleicacid

duplexes,andproposedthatfurtherresearchisneededtoanalyzetheantiferromag-
netism/superconductivity of DNA (Starikov 2003). Apalkov and Chakraborty
directly calculated the almost linear temperature-dependence of magnetization of
DNA, and they think the magnetization of DNA chains is due to the electron–
electronand/orelectron–vibrationinteractions(ApalkovandChakraborty2008).
A number of studies on the magnetic susceptibility of nucleic acids are being
conducted along with investigations into the physical model of nucleic acids.
In 2005, Nakamae et al. measured the magnetic susceptibility of DNA.
According to their measurement, the magnetic susceptibility of λ-DNA is
-(0.63 ± 0.1) × 10 -6 emu/g (-7.91 ± 1.26 × 10 -9 m3/kg, SI) at a temperature
higherthan100K,inbothA-DNAandB-DNAstates.However,whenthetemper-

Moreover,theS-shapedM–H(magnetization–magneticfield)curvemightbecaused

3.2.2 Protein
We summarized the reported magnetic susceptibility of proteins in Table 3.4,
including both the original data in the literature in various units, as well as their
convertedvaluesinSIunits.
3.2.2.1 HemoglobinandMyoglobin
Whenitcomestothemagneticpropertiesofproteins,hemoglobinisthefirstprotein
thatweshoulddiscusssinceithasaspecialplaceinthestudyofthemagnetismof
biological materials due to its unique structure. Gamgee had previously proven in
1901 that oxyhemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin, and methemoglobin are diamag-
netic,whichwaslaterconfirmedbyotherresearchers(Gamgee 1901).Paulingand
Coryell published two articles in PNAS on the magnetic properties of hemoglobin
and related compounds, offering a complete description of their magnetism and
structure, laying the foundations for further investigations (Pauling and Coryell
1936a,b).Theyproposedthatoxyhemoglobinandcarboxyhemoglobinarediamag-
netic because they lack unpaired electrons, whereas deoxyhemoglobin
(ferrohemoglobin) contains four unpaired electron pairs per iron atom and has a
magneticmomentof5.46μ perheme.Intheyearsthereafter,severalinvestigations

to determine the magnetic moment of the cow ferrohemoglobin, which was
(5.43 ± 0.015) μ (Taylor and Coryell 1938). When Havemann and colleagues
B
discoveredthatthemassmagneticsusceptibilityofglobinwas-0.53×10 -6cgs(-
6.66×10 -9m3/kg,SI),confirmingPauling’shypothesisthatglobinisdiamagnetic
(Havemann et al. 1962). Savick and colleagues also investigated the magnetic
susceptibility of oxy-and carbonmonoxyhemoglobins (Table 3.4) (Savicki et al.
1984). Taylor first reported the magnetic susceptibility of ferrimyoglobin, which
hefoundtobethesameasthatofferrichemoglobin.Inmyoglobin,wherethereis
onlyonehemepermoleculeandhemoglobincanbewellseparatedinsolution,there
is no interaction between the four hemes of hemoglobin (Taylor 1939). But this
conclusion contradicts Pauling’s previous suggestion (Pauling and Coryell 1936a).
Then, with reference to the source of magnetic properties in hemoglobin and
myoglobin, Weissbluth proposed that low-spin compounds (e.g., oxyhemoglobin)
are not paramagnetic and they are entirely diamagnetic in low-spin derivatives
(Weissbluth1967).
Hemoglobin and myoglobin derivatives exhibit considerable changes in their
magnetic properties when the R groups on the one side of the porphyrin–globin
complex are replaced by other ions or molecules. However, although all of these
hemoglobin and myoglobin derivatives include Fe element centers, there is also a
distinctionbetweenhighandlowspin.Forexample,thehemoglobinF–andOH –
2
derived derivatives are high-spin types, but the hemoglobin CN– and imidazole-
derived derivatives have low-spin. Furthermore, Coryell et al. discovered that the
magnetic susceptibility of ferrihemoglobin varied dramatically when the pH of the
solution was altered (Coryell et al. 1937). In a study published in 1975, Anusiema
discovered that 5% t-butanol had an influence on the magnetic susceptibility of
ferrihemoglobin. These phenomena may be caused by the fact that the Fe atom in
ferrihemoglobin is octahedrally located in solutions with different pH values than
hemoglobin,causingashiftinitsisotypeviabondchangesandprotonloss;andthat
differentpHenvironmentscanleadtochangesinthepositionoftheFeatomrelative
to the porphyrin ring, resulting in changes in the high- and low-spin states. In
addition to the fact that t-butanol might enhance the number of high-spin groups,
it is possible that any of these factors may produce changes in the magnetic
propertiesofferrihemoglobin(Anusiem1975).
3.2.2.2 Cytochromes
Cytochromesareheme-typecompoundsthatarecoupledwithproteinsandcontrib-
ute to electron transport (Senftle and Hambright 1969). By measurement and
calculation,Boerietal.foundthatthemagneticsusceptibilityofcytochromecwas

bound by the protein, they discovered that the reduced state of ferrous
ferricytochrome c was more less diamagnetic than the oxidized state, which was

3 MagneticPropertiesofBiologicalSamples 57
consistent with previous findings. Furthermore, the magnetic susceptibility of the
protein attached to water was the same as the magnetic susceptibility of unbound
water. The dried form of ferricytochrome c was more paramagnetic than the
dehydrated form. This difference may be due to the pairing of electrons as water
alterssomeimidazolegroups(Lumryetal.1962).EhrenbergandYonetanihypoth-
esized that the magnetic susceptibility of cytochrome a in the oxidized state is
2400 × 10 -6 cgs emu (0.30 × 10 -9 m3/kg, SI), which was similar to that of
cytochrome c, because both the oxidized and reduced forms are low-spin. When
reduced,cytochromea3isahigh-spinFe(II)derivative,andtheoxidizedformhasa

andYonetani1961).AstudyconductedbyBanciindicatedthatbothdiamagnetism
and paramagnetism contributed to the magnetic susceptibility of cytochrome b5
when the magnetic field was measured in various orientations. The levels of mag-
netization observed in different orientations were also variable. As a result, they
determinedthatintheparamagneticheme-containingsystem,itisthemetalionsand
porphyrinsthatcontributetothemagneticsusceptibility,withbothofthesecontrib-
uting much more than the side chains of different aromatic groups and peptide
chains. The magnetic anisotropy is induced by the structure of the heme, as well
asotherfactors(Bancietal.1998).
3.2.2.3 Ferritin,Fe-Transferrin,andFerredoxin
ConsideringthatthecoreelementFeistheprimarysourceofthemagneticproperties
of hemoglobin, it is worthwhile to consider the magnetic properties of all proteins
containing Fe atoms as well. Ferritin is an iron storage protein with a high iron
concentration, and it is found in large quantities in the body. After conducting
measurements,Granickdiscoveredthattheferritinironwasintheferricstate,with
a magnetic moment of 3.78 μ per g-atom of Fe (Granick and Michaelis 1942).

3.2.2.4 CopperProteins
Copperisanimportanttransitionmetalinbiology.Thefunctionsofcopperproteins
include simple electron transfer, substrate oxidation/oxygenation, and oxygen
migration. Three common types of copper proteins have been defined based on
theirelectronandmagneticproperties.Type1(T1)copperproteinsarealsoknown
as blue copper proteins; type 2 (T2) copper proteins do not possess a blue copper
center and are usually found in oxidation/oxygenation enzymes (e.g., galactose
oxidase); type 3 (T3) copper proteins have binuclear copper centers, each linked
by three histidine. T3 copper proteins are involved in oxygen transport and activa-
tion(hemocyaninandtyrosinase).BothT1andT2copperareelectronparamagnetic
resonance (EPR) active in their oxidized state (Cu(II), 3d9, S = 1/2), T3 copper is
EPR silent on oxidation, and all types of copper centers are in the reduced state
(Cu(I),3d10,S=0)(RichandMaréchal2012).Asearlyas1958,Nakamura,after
measuring and calculating the difference in magnetic susceptibility between apo-,
oxidized, and reduced laccase, discovered that the magnetic susceptibility of
copperinnativelaccasewas24×10 -6/gCu(Nakamura1958).Basedonmeasure-
mentsandcalculations,Ehrenbergetal.reportedmagneticsusceptibilitydifference

form of Cu(II) (Ehrenberg et al. 1962), which was consistent with Broman’s ESR
conclusion in 1962 (43–48%) (Broman et al. 1962). Aisen et al. measured and
calculated the diamagnetic anisotropy of ceruloplasmin to be 7.1 × 10 -7 cgs/cm3
(8.92×10 -6,SI)andsuggestedthatatleast40%ofthecopperinceruloplasminis

3.2.2.5 AssembledProteins
Asidefromtheinfluenceofparticularmetalionsonelectrontransport,themagnetic
susceptibility of protein molecules is closely related to the structure of the protein
molecules. One of the most interesting for scientists is tubulin. Microtubules are
macromolecularcompoundsfoundinthecytoplasmofalleukaryoticcells,andthat
they are assemblies made up of elongated protofilaments (Amos and Baker 1979).
Protofilamentsarefibrillarnetwork structuresformedbyfirsttyingtogether micro-
tubule protein dimers (Amos and Klug 1974; Wickstead and Gull 2011). This
ordered arrangement of the assembly structure is of great interest for the study
of its magnetic properties. In 1982, Vassilev et al. observed parallel arrangement
of microtubules in a magnetic field of 0.02 T, which is caused by the diamagnetic
anisotropyofthetubulinmolecule(Vassilevetal.1982).Diamagneticanisotropyis
aresult oftheanisotropyofchemicalbonds,whichwas moreapparentinresonant
structuressuchasaromaticgroups,peptidebonds,ordoubleandtriplecarbonbonds.
As early as 1936, Pauling proposed the theory that aromatic ring-induced cyclic
currents cause diamagnetic anisotropy in aromatic molecules (Pauling 1936). And
aromatic amino acids, in which the same non-local ring currents are present, and
non-aromaticmolecules,despitetheabsenceoflocalringcurrents,havediamagnetic
anisotropyconsistingofthesumofthelocalanisotropybuiltbetweenatoms(Maret
and Dransfeld 1985). Pauling further calculated the diamagnetic anisotropy of the
peptide bond to be -5.36 × 10 -6 emu and indicated that the anisotropic magnetic
susceptibility of theamino acid residues ofeachchain with anα-helical secondary
structureis(2.6±0.2)×10 -6peraminoacidresidue(Pauling1979).Samulskiand
Tobolski successfully localized r-benzyl L-glutamate with a highly α-helical struc-
ture by a moderate intensity magnetic field (Samulski and Tobolsky 1971). When
aminoacidsareorganizedintheα-helicalform,allofthepeptidebondsaresituated
inaplaneparalleltothehelicalaxis,andthetotalmagnetizationofthisaminoacidis
derivedfrom thesum of individualmagnetizations along the main axis. And some
studieshaveshownthattubulindimershavearelativelyhighproportionofα-helices
(circular dichroism tests have shown that 25% of amino acids contain α-helix
structures)andthatthissecondarystructureisorientedalongthelongaxis(Ventilla
etal.1972;Leeetal.1978).ThistheoreticalfoundationallowedBrastopredictthe
value of diamagnetic anisotropies of the tubulin dimers with a minimum value of
1.01×10 -28m3,whichwasconfirmedin1998(Brasetal.1998).Hesubsequently
confirmed a further discussion of the diamagnetic anisotropy of tubulin dimers in
2014, determining values of magnetic anisotropy of 3.7 and 4.5 × 10 -27 J/T2
(different calculation methods) and suggested that in addition to the α-helix, the
β-sheet structure also makes a contribution (Bras et al. 2014). This method for
determining the diamagnetic magnetization of tubulin dimers can be well applied
to other proteins and macromolecular assemblies. It is believed that fibrin and

magneticallyorientated.In1983,Freyssinetetal.foundthatthestrongorientationof
Fibrin occurs when it is aggregated in a strong magnetic field by observing
the magnetically induced birefringence (Freyssinet et al. 1983). Torebett et al.
used the same method to observe the self-assembly process of collagen and esti-
matedthevalueoftheanisotropyofmagneticsusceptibilityofcollagentobeabout

3.2.3 Lipids
As early as in 1939, Lonsdale proposed that the presence of hydrocarbon chains
contributes to the magnetic anisotropy in aliphatic compounds (Lonsdale 1939).
Thesedoubleortriplebondsconstrainsomeelectronstooccupytheplanarorbitals
oftheatoms,thusgeneratingthediamagneticanisotropyifthechainisperpendicular
to the SMF direction. In 1970, Chalazonitis reported the phenomenon that the
rod-like outersegmentofthefrog retinacanbealignedwiththeexternallyapplied
SMF direction (Chalazonitis et al. 1970). Then Hong et al. proposed that the
diamagnetism of component molecules is involved in the orientation of
biomembrane.Theydemonstratedthatthesumofmolecule–magneticfieldinterac-
tions is sufficient to orient retinal rod cells, and the magnetic orientation of other
membranous microstructures depends on their structure and morphology (Hong
etal.1971).In1978,Boroskeetal.measuredandcalculatedthemagneticanisotropy
of egg lecithin, determining a variation in magnetic susceptibility parallel and
perpendicular to the lecithin molecule’s long axis of -(0.28 ± 0.02) × 10 -8 cgs
(-3.52 ± 0.25 × 10 -8, SI) at 23 °C(Boroske and Helfrich 1978). In 1984, Scholz
et al. reported that the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility of cylindrical vesicles
was 1.7 times greater than that for egg lecithin. They ascribed the variation to the
differentconcentrationsofunsaturatedacylchainsinthetwosamples(Scholzetal.
1984).In1993,Azanzaexaminedthemagneticpropertiesofdriedhuman erythro-
cytemembranepowderinamagneticfieldof5T.Inthisstudy,theyobservedthat
the magnetic susceptibility of dried human red blood cell membranes was
-(4.59 ± 0.15) × 10 -7 emu/g (-5.77 ± 0.19 × 10 -9 m3/kg, SI) and the value of
the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility was -(9.18 ± 0.3) × 10 -7 emu/g
(-11.53 ± 0.38 × 10 -9 m3/kg, SI) (Azanza et al. 1993). The orientation changes
of red blood cells and cylindrical lipid vesicles in SMFs (Fig. 3.1) (Boroske and
Helfrich 1978;Higashi et al.1993)will be discussed in more detailsin Chap. 6 of
thisbook.Infact,therearealsoseveralotherreportsabouttheorientationofprotein-
free lipid bilayer structures in SMFs (Gaffney and McConnell 1974; Maret and

detectthatthemagneticsusceptibilitydifferencebetweenhumanbloodinvitroand
water was 5 × 10 -6, which greatly differs from that of water (Sosnytskyy et al.
2000). In 2012, Jain applied MRI to measure the difference in volume magnetic
susceptibility between fully oxygen-containing and fully deoxygenated blood
invitro,whichwas0.273ppm(cgs)(3.43×10 -6,SI)(Jainetal.2012).

Asearlyasin1901,Gamgeefoundthatthemagneticsusceptibilityofhemoglo-
bin and other hemochrome derivatives was negative, while that of protoheme and
ferrohemewaspositive(Gamgee1901).Themagneticpropertiesofhemoglobinor
its derivativecompounds were decidedby thestate ofiron. Globinisdiamagnetic,
and the magnetic properties difference of hemoglobin are determined by heme, a
compoundcomposedofironandporphyrin.Therefore,althoughtheporphyrincore
isdiamagnetic,themagneticpropertiesofdifferentmetalloporphyrinsareobviously
different. Heme with Fe(II) as the central ion is known as ferroheme, while heme-
containingFe(III)iscalled ferriheme. IfFe(III)isconnected to ahydroxyl ion,the
hemeiscalledironhydroxideheme;thecompoundcomposedofFe(III)andchlorine
is called ferric chloride heme. When these four hemes are combined with globin,
theyformreducedhemoglobinandmethemoglobin,respectively.Thesetwotypesof
hemoglobin can react with other ions or molecules to form a large number of
hemoglobinderivatives.Forinstance,myoglobinisawell-knownexample(Pauling
andCoryell1936a).In1980,Eatonetal.measuredthemagneticpropertiesoffour
porphyrin compounds and found that their magnetic susceptibilities were all nega-
tive(EatonandEaton1980).Moreover,Chaneetal.conductedX-raydiffractionon
variousporphyrins,metalloporphyrins,andhemins,andfoundthatporphyrincores
are not always planar, and metal ions are not always located in the plane of four
pyrrole nitrogen atoms. The magnetic properties of these ions are different funda-
mentally because of their different types, spatial positions, and chemical states
(Chanceetal.1966).
Somestudieshaveshownthatdipyridinehemochrome,dicyanidehemochrome,
and CO-pyridine hemochrome are all diamagnetic (Pauling and Coryell 1936a;
Wang et al. 1958), while the magnetic moment of ferroheme in NaOH ranges
from 4.83 to 5.02 μ , and that of fixed hemin is within the range of 5.81–5.97 μ
B B
(Pauling and Coryell 1936a; Schoffa and Scheler 1957; Havemann et al. 1962;
Hambright et al. 1968). Moreover, the magnetic susceptibility tensor of heme
porphyrins is mostly axial, and this central axis is perpendicular to the plane of
heme, indicating that heme is anisotropic and heme-containing substances would
exhibitmagneticanisotropy(Bancietal.1998).

When it comes to the magnetic properties of unicellular organisms, we have to
mention magnetotactic bacteria (MTB), which have characteristic compass-like
magnetosomes in their bodies and can orient and migrate along the geomagnetic
field lines and have been extensively studied (Bazylinski and Frankel 2004;
Bazylinski and Williams 2006; Faivre and Schuler 2008; Lefevre et al. 2011).
MTBwerefirstlyreportedin1975byBlakemoreforitsmagnetotaxisphenomenon
(Blakemore 1975), and the ultrastructural details of magnetosome were then
described in 1980 (Balkwill et al. 1980). In most magnetotactic bacteria, the
magnetosomesarearrangedinchains,whichmakethetotalmagneticdipolemoment
ofthebacteriadeterminedbythesumofthepermanentmagneticdipolemomentof
theindividualmagnetosomeparticles(BazylinskiandFrankel2004).
In2007,Melnikdevelopedaninstrumentcalledcelltrackingvelocimeter(CTV)
to detect the magneto-optical mobility of atrophic bacillus (formerly known as
bacillus globigii), Bacillus thuringiensis, and bacillus cereus. It was found that all
bacterial strains showed the peak value of element Mn and relatively high average
magnetic mobility after sporulation. They believed that the high level inherent
magnetic susceptibility reflected by magnetic mobility was mostly likely caused
byparamagneticelementMn(Melniketal. 2007).Zhouetal.furtherexploredthe
intrinsicmagneticpropertiesofsporesinBacillusmegaterium,Bacilluscereus,and
Bacillus subtilis. They measured the samples with the SQUID and found that the
average magnetic moment of spores in Bacillus cereus was 5.1 μ (Mn content
B
2.3×1022kg -1),whichwasrelativelylow,whilethatofBacillusmegateriumand
Bacillussubtiliswere5.9μ (Mncontent1.55×1022kg -1)and5.5μ (Mncontent
B B
4.2 × 1022 kg -1). It is obvious that the Mn content was inconsistent with the
magneticmoment.AlthoughMnwasthemainreasonfortheparamagneticproper-
ties of spores in Bacillus subtilis, the author proposed that it is 3+ rather than 2+.
Theirconclusionisthattheparamagneticpropertiesofbacillussporesarecausedby
different chemicalstatesoftheelementMn,andthemagneticsusceptibilitycanbe
changedbyvaryingtheMncontentintheculturemedium(Zhouetal.2018).

that,eachgramofferritin–hemosiderin(storageiron)wouldbeexpectedtoincrease
themagneticsusceptibilityofahumanliverbyabout0.08×10 -6emu(1.00×10 -6,
SI) per cubic centimeter(Bauman and Harris 1967). In2021, Klohs et al.used the
vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) to measure the magnetic susceptibility and
water content of fresh and chemically fixed mouse tissues (Klohs and Hirt 2021).
They found that all samples show mass susceptibilities between -0.068 and
-1.929 × 10 -8 m3/kg (SI), compared to -9.338 × 10 -9 m3/kg (SI) of double
distilled water. Moreover, they found that, the cardiac tissues feature stronger
diamagnetic properties compared with other tissue samples. Besides, the magnetic
susceptibility of chemically fixed cardiac tissues is generally smaller than that of
fresh tissue. It is the chemical fixation, but not the water content, that affected the
diamagneticpropertiesofthesamples.However,whenitcomestotheotherorgans
and tissues, it is unknown why there is no significant difference between
freshvs.fixedtissuesintermsofmagneticsusceptibility.Itisinterestingthatfixed
tissue showed no dependence of susceptibility with temperature, whereas fresh
tissue does, indicating the presence of paramagnetic components (Klohs and Hirt
2021).
Moststudiesofaboutnormaltissuemagneticpropertiesfocusedonthebrain.For
example, in 1992, Kirschvink et al. reported the existence of ferromagnetic sub-
stancesincerebraltissues(Kirschvinketal.1992).In2015,Kopanietal.showthat
among all the areas of human brain, the areas related to motor function (Globus
pallidus,putamen,andsubstantianigra)havethehighestironconcentration.Ironin
the human brain mainly exists in the form of ferritin, hemosiderin (decomposition
product of ferritin), and other biomineralized oxides such as hematite (Fe O ),
2 3
magnetite(Fe O ),andmaghemite(γ-Fe O )(Kopanietal.2015).In2017,Kopáni
3 4 2 3
et al. proposed that the content of diamagnetic oxyhemoglobin and paramagnetic
deoxyhemoglobinalsocontributedtothemagneticsusceptibilityofcerebraltissues,
butthecontributionwasdeterminedbythecontentofthesesubstances(Kopánietal.
2017).In2018,Hametneretal.clarifiedthedirectcorrelationbetweenthemagnetic
susceptibilityandironcontentofcerebraltissuesbymeasuringquantitativesuscep-
tibility mapping (QSM) of human cerebral tissues, which further spelled out the
influenceofironcontentincerebraltissuesonthemagneticsusceptibilityofcerebral
tissues(Hametneretal.2018).
Gelderen etal.usedthetorquebalancetomeasurethedistributionofresonance
frequencyaroundWMfiberbundleofthehumanbrain,soastostudyandcalculate
theanisotropyofmagneticsusceptibilitiesinWM.Theyfoundthatthesusceptibility
ofWMinthecentralnervoussystemwasdecidedbythedirectionofWMrelativeto
the magnetic field, and such anisotropy would produce a tiny magnetic torque
directly proportional to the volume of the fiber bundle. The quantitative results
showed that the anisotropic magnetic susceptibility of WM ranged from 13.6 to
19.2ppb(13.6×10 -6to19.2×10 -6,SI).Basedontheaboveresults,theresonance
frequency of MRI depends on the direction of brain microstructures relative to the
main magnetic field, and the orientation of these microstructures affects the reso-
nancefrequencyofWMtosomeextent(vanGelderenetal.2015).

3 MagneticPropertiesofBiologicalSamples 65
Itisinterestingbutpuzzlingthatalthoughnearlyallstudiesshowthatbiological
tissues are diamagnetic, there is one study that detected paramagnetism for all the
tissues (Sant’Ovaia et al. 2015). They also reported that the samples obtained in
females showed lower values of magnetic susceptibility than those resected from
males and the samples collected from the lungs of smokers have higher values of
magneticsusceptibility.
For the magnetic anisotropy, most studies also focused on the brain
(Svennerholm et al. 1992; Luo et al. 2014). For example, it was shown that the
myelin sheath could affect the anisotropic magnetic susceptibilities of cerebral
tissues.AccordingtoLuoetal.,thevariationoftheMRfrequencyofwhitematter
(WM)isdependentbythesymmetricaldistributionofmagneticsubstancesincells
rather than the average magnetic susceptibility of tissues. They used the rat optic
nervewhichcontainlongitudinallyarrangedmyelinsheathandneurofilamenttissues
as models, and measured its magnetic susceptibility using the deviation of MR
resonance frequency. The results showed that the magnetic susceptibility of water
was-9.035ppm(-9.035×10 -6,SI),therewasadifferenceof-(0.116±0.010)
ppm(-0.116±0.010×10 -6,SI)betweenthevolumemagneticsusceptibilitiesof
the optic nerve and water, and the difference between the longitudinal magnetic
susceptibilitiesofopticnervewas-(0.043±0.009)ppm(-0.043±0.009×10 -6,
SI)(Luoetal.2014).
Besides,organssuchaskidneys,heart,andconnectivetissuesarealsocharacter-
izedbymagneticanisotropy.Theiranisotropyisdifferentfromthatofmyelinsheath
in cerebral tissues. For example, the kidney has ordered tubular structure, basal
membrane, and renal epithelial cells, which are all potential sources of anisotropic
magnetic susceptibility. Through the susceptibility tensor imaging, it is found that
magnetic anisotropy of tubular was more diamagnetic when tubules were aligned
with the magnetic field, and it was more paramagnetic when tubules were aligned
orthogonal to the magnetic field (Xie et al. 2015). With fibrous protein known as
collagen, connective tissues have a more orderly structure. As mentioned earlier,
collagenfibrilshaveplanesofpeptidegroupsparalleltothehelicalaxis,andtheirnet
magneticsusceptibilityisthehighestinthedirectionparalleltothefibrilaxis.Sucha
tendencyiscontrarytotheanisotropyofmagneticsusceptibilitiesobservedinbones
andmyocardialfibers(Dibbetal.2017).
3.4.2.2 TumorTissues
In1961,SenftleandThorpemeasuredthemagneticsusceptibilityofhepatictissues
in rats with implanted hepatoma and that of normal hepatic tissues, and found that
the hepatoma was more diamagnetic while normal rats’ liver tissues were less
diamagnetic(SenftleandThorpe1961)(Table3.6).Theyalsoprocessedthesamples
at the liquid nitrogen temperature and measured the magnetic susceptibilities of
wateranddifferenttissueswithinthetemperaturerangeof77–263K.Theirresults
showed that the magnetic susceptibilities of the three types of tissues varied

drastically within the temperature range of 130–140 K, and below 150 K (Senftle
andThorpe1961).
Mulay et al. studied the magnetic susceptibilities of Cloudman S91 melanoma,
S91Amelanoma(withoutmelanin),andnormalmousetissuesandfoundthattheir
magnetic susceptibilities are tissue and temperature-dependent. They pointed out
thatsucharesultwascausedbymagneticsubstancesindifferenttissues,suchasfree
radicals or paramagnetic ions. Their ESR results confirmed the existence of free
radicalsandparamagneticionsinS91melanoma(MulayandMulay1967).
Abnormal expression of iron and ferritin can be observed in many types of
cancers. Brem et al. measured the magnetization of human meningioma tissue and
human non-tumor hippocampus tissue. The diamagnetic signal meningioma tissue
(2.14×10 -5Am2/kg)wasmuchlargerthanthatofhippocampustissue(0.22×10 -5
Am2/kg)(Bremetal.2006).

magneticallyinducedvelocityoftheRBCs,themagnetophoreticmobility,depends
on both the oxygenation or oxidation state of hemoglobin iron and the quantity of
hemoglobinironwithineachRBC(Jinetal.2011).Moreover,themagnetophoresis
of RBCs based on their magnetic susceptibility has been developed. The malarial
parasite digests hemoglobin to leave high-spin oxidized heme products which are
paramagnetic, but normal low-spin oxyhemoglobin, which is diamagnetic. Conse-
quently, it should be possible to separate parasitized erythrocytes from normal
oxygenated ones which will selectively separate the cells which have such a high-
spin form of hemoglobin and can be magnetically concentrated in the blood of
infectedpatients(Pauletal.1981).Meanwhile,cellmagnetophoresismayalsoprove
to be capable of separating nucleated RBCs from cell mixtures and identifying
different levels of methemoglobin based on the different oxidative susceptibilities
oftheintracellularenvironment(Zborowskietal.2003).
Many studies on the magnetic properties of cells are based on the magnetic
properties of RBCs due to their unique composition and biconcave disk shape.
Covered by the cell membrane composed of lipid bilayers, RBCs orient in the
magnetic field (Fig. 3.1). However, the magnetic orientation of solidified RBCs
was opposite to that of normal RBCs, and their biconcave discoid shape was
perpendiculartotheSMFdirection.Forthisphenomenon,theyheldthattheaverage
ratioofcellmembraneofRBCstohemoglobinwasabout1:70,andtheorientation
ofthehemoglobininthemagneticfieldwasdeterminedbytheorderofhemoglobin
when it was solidified. The spin state of hemoglobin decides its paramagnetic and
diamagnetic anisotropy. They measured the anisotropic (van Gelderen et al. 2015)
magnetic susceptibilities of immobilized RBCs in a high-spin state and a low-spin
state,whichwere2×107D /celland5×106D /cell,respectively.Accordingtothe

results, the orientation of the solidified RBCs was determined by the diamagnetic
anisotropyofsomehemoglobininthecells,andtheRBCsinahigh-spinstatehada
greater magnetic anisotropy because of their stronger paramagnetic anisotropy
(Takeuchietal.1995).
Yamagishietal.comparedthediamagneticorientationofplateletsandRBCsina

blood cells. Kim et al. used the CTV to analyze the magnetic characteristics of
humanmonocytes,plasmaplatelets,oxygen-containingerythrocytes,andmethemo-
globin erythrocytes, concluding that monocytes had the highest magnetic mobility
andthattheaveragemagneticmobilityofmonocyteswas7.8timesfasterthanthatof
methemoglobin erythrocytes. In addition, positive magnetic velocity was also
observed in some plasma samples, indicating that platelets may contain iron. This
result shows that monocytes and platelets are possibly paramagnetic (Kim et al.
2019;Gómez-Pastoraetal.2021).
3.4.3.2 CancerCells
Inspiredbythemagneticseparationtechnique,in2006,Kashevskiietal.examined
themagneticsusceptibility ofHeLa cancer cellsbydetecting theirtrajectoryinthe
magnetic field and comparing it with that of RBCs. They found that the cells’
diamagnetic susceptibility increased with the increase of their diameter, which
theythinkisbecausethenucleusandcytoplasmhavedifferentmagneticproperties.
Their measurement shows that the diamagnetic susceptibility of HeLa tumor
cellsis-(0.5136–0.5179)×10 -6(differenttumorcelldiameter),whilethediamag-
neticsusceptibilityofredbloodcellsvariedfrom-0.731×10 -6(withfulloxygen-
ated hemoglobin) to -0.573 × 10 -6 (with reduced hemoglobin) (Kashevskii et al.
2006).
Also in 2006, Han et al. successfully separated human breast cancer cell lines
(MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435) using the magnetophoresis
microseparatoroftheparamagneticcapture(PMC)mode(Fig.3.2).Aftermeasuring
themicro-electricalimpedanceofthesehumanbreastcancercelllinesandcompar-

thatnormalcelllinesandcancercelllineshadsignificantlydifferentmicro-electrical

ent pathological stages of human breast cancer cell lines, which verifies different
magneticpropertiesofthesecellstosomeextent(Hanetal.2006).
In2020,ourlaboratorymeasuredthemagneticsusceptibilityofhumannasopha-
ryngeal carcinoma CNE-2Z cells by SQUID-MPMS3. It was found that the M–H
curve of CNE-2Z cells was paramagnetic at low temperatures, which indicated the
existence of some paramagnetic components. We further examined the magnetic
susceptibilitiesofcytoplasmandnucleusofCNE-2Z cellsandfoundthatthemass
magneticsusceptibilitiesofcytoplasmandnucleuswere(9.888±0.6)×10 -9m3/kg

dria and free radicals. However, the nucleus is diamagnetic, because it mainly
containsDNA,nucleoprotein,andlipids(Taoetal.2020).

3.5 Conclusion
The magnetic properties of biological samples are critical for their responses to
externally applied magnetic fields, which are determined by their composition,
structure,andavarietyofotherfactors.Currently,theexactmagneticpropertiesof
most biological samples are still unclear, especially at their physiological and
pathological conditions. Future works are strongly encouraged to systematically
and accurately measure the magnetic properties of biological samples at molecule,

Abstract Almost all types of life that have been appropriately investigated have
shown some indication of biological response to magnetic fields. An alluring
applicationofthisever-increasingamountofinformationdescribinghowbiological
systems sense magnetic fields and transduce this information into physiological
response is to treat human disease. Toward that goal, this chapter summarizes
electromagnetic biosensing in a diverse set of organisms across several phyla, and
discusseshowtheunderlyingmechanismsapplyordonotapplytohumans.

4.1 Introduction
Thischapterexploresthebiologicalbasisfortherapeuticeffectsofelectromagnetic
fields (EMFs) in people, with a focus on static magnetic fields (SMFs; basic
definitionsofmagnetismarebrieflyreviewedinSect.4.1ofthischapter).Atpresent,
there is no clear and widely accepted mechanism by which SMFs benefit human
health (Driessen et al. 2020); indeed, there is considerable skepticism in the main-
stream media (as well as in certain parts of the scientific literature) whether SMFs
haveanyeffectatall.Forexample,apurportedlackofbeneficialeffectssometimes

To illustrate, although there are occasional reports to the contrary (Carles et al.
2020), the bulk of the evidence indicates that living in proximity to high voltage
electrical power lines does not increase the risk of cancer (Ahlbom et al. 2001;
Anonymous 2002; Schüz 2011; Crespi et al. 2016; Amoon et al. 2022). To some,

this lack of harm also implies that EMF exposure likely has negligible beneficial
effects.
Ontheotherhand,itiswellestablishedthatawiderangeoflivingorganisms—
ranging from bacteria, mollusks, crustaceans, insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles,
birds, and mammals (Wiltschko and Wiltschko 2012; Todorović et al. 2020)—use
the earth’s relatively weak magnetic field (i.e., geomagnetism) for orientation,
navigation, and additional purposes covered in Sect. 4.2 of this chapter. As will
become evident from this information, the mechanisms that many species use for
magnetoreception are highly specialized and do not apply directly to humans. In
somecases,however,theunderlyingmolecularbasisofmagneticsensingrelieson
broadmechanismsobservedacrossphyla,therebyprovidingaconceptualbasisfor
how human cells, tissues, and organs can respond to SMFs. If nothing else, prece-
dent from non-mammalian systems provides a starting point for investigation of
magneticfieldsensinginhumans.Oneexampleliesinongoingeffortstoestablish

netite (discussed in Sect. 4.3) was first described in prokaryotes half a century ago

Although much has been discovered about magnetoreception, many aspects of
magneticfieldbiosensingremainpoorlyunderstoodandtheirbasicmechanismsare
unknown. This is particularly true for humans, where the very topic of whether

controversial.Here,inSect.4.4ofthischapter,weprovideanoverviewofsensing

4.2.1 Ferromagnetism, Paramagnetism, and Diamagnetism
Ferromagnetism is “everyday” magnetism; for example, permanent magnets (such
asubiquitousrefrigeratormagnetsorremovablecarbumperstickers)areferromag-
netic.Aferromagneticsubstancebecomesmagnetizedwhenexposedtoamagnetic
fieldandretainsthisfeature“permanently”afterremovalfromthefield.Asacaveat,

ferromagnetism is not strictly permanent because field strength often wanes over
time, and can be affected (i.e., field direction can be reversed) by exposure to a
subsequentlyappliedfieldordiminishedbyheatingthemagnet.Nevertheless,field
strengthsofferromagnetscanberemarkablystableoverlongperiodsoftimeinthe
absenceofhightemperaturesorcounteractingmagneticfields.Asasecondnuance,
althoughtheterm“ferro”implicitlysuggeststhatferromagnetscontainiron,several
other metals have ferromagnetic properties including most alloys of nickel and
cobalt as well as several rare earth metals (neodymium is a well-known example).
Afinalfeature,importantforbiologicalmagnetosensing,isthatthesemetalsarenot
inherentlymagneticwithouttheproperatomic-levelorganization.Forexample,iron
in solution or in prevalent biological contexts (e.g., when it is complexed with
hemoglobin in erythrocytes) is not ferromagnetic. Instead, constituent atoms and
molecularstructures(e.g.,ironoxidesinthecaseofferromagnets)mustbeorganized
intodistinctcrystallinestructurestobemagnetic.Suchstructurescanoccurnaturally
as lodestone (iron ore) in the mineral world and, in specialized situations in the
biologicalrealm,asmagnetite.
Paramagnetism is a dynamic phenomenon; paramagnetic substances “become
magnetic”whileexposed toamagneticfield,buttheinducedeffect rapidlydecays
upon loss of the primary magnetic field as thermal motion quickly randomizes the
spin orientations of the constituent atoms. Examples of paramagnetic substances
include free electrons found in metals and unpaired electrons found in many
biologicalmolecules.Indeed,inbiology,manyproteinsarecomplexedwithmetals
that have unpaired electrons, leading to the development of the commonly used
electronparamagneticresonance(EPR)spectroscopies(Bertinietal.2012;Sahuand
Lorigan 2020). In addition to exploiting the natural paramagnetism of biological
molecules,effortsareunderwaytocreateultramagneticcellsbyendowingthemwith
chelatedparamagneticiron(Rameshetal.2018).Similarly,paramagneticchemical
probes are becoming increasingly useful for studying biological macromolecules
(Miaoetal.2022).
Diamagnetism is a property of all materials that describes the formation of an
induced magnetic field in the direction opposite to an externally applied field; in
other words, the induced field attempts to repel the applied field (note that this is
opposite to paramagnetism where the induced field is attracted to, and aligns with,
the external field). Molecules found in biological systems ranging from water to
bioorganicmacromoleculesaretypicallyonlyveryweaklydiamagnetic,resultingin
diamagnetism overshadowed by external fields or by surrounding paramagnetic or
ferromagnetic entities. Despite eliciting weaker responses in biological molecules
than paramagnetism, diamagnetic effects on biological systems can be dramatic
because diamagnetic materials can be stably floated in magnetic fields. As a result
frogsandmicehavebeenlevitatedusingstrongmagneticfields(VallesJretal.1997;
Liu et al. 2010), making for visually effective demonstrations of their diamagnetic
properties.

4.2.2 Field Types and Strengths
LifeevolvedinthepresenceoftheEarth’smagneticfield(i.e.,“geomagnetism”);the
geomagnetic field (GMF) fluctuates in direction and strength over time and space.
Currently, the GMF has a magnitude at the Earth’s surface that ranges from 25 to
65 microteslas (μT; or 0.25 to 0.65 gauss [1 T equals 10,000 guass]). This field is
considered to be “weak” insofar as it cannot be detected by humans during their
everyday activities in meaningful or noticeable ways without specialized instru-
ments. To provide context for magnetic field strengths: the human brain emits a
much weaker magnetic field (~0.1–1 picoT) while cardiac pacemakers produce
fields about an order of magnitude stronger than GMFs (~500 μT); a refrigerator
magnetisyetanotherorderofmagnitudestronger(~5mT);adevicecustom-builtto
treatculturedhumancells(Fig.4.1)providesanother~2orderjumpinfieldstrength
(~0.25 T); another order of magnitude increase in strength (to ~1–3 T) represents
typicalstereoloudspeaker fields aswell asMRIexposure;andfinally,a17Tfield
representsthestrengthneededtofamouslylevitateafrog(VallesJretal.1997).For
the purposes of this chapter’s discussion, magnetic fields in the range of geomag-
netismaretermed“weak.”Forhigherstrengthfields,fieldsbelow1Tareconsidered
tobe“moderate”strengthandthoseabove1Tareconsideredtobe“strong”(most
therapeutic magnetic treatments fall in the moderate strength category). Finally,
although many electromagnetic fields (EMFs) involve a time-varying component,
thischapterprimarilyfocusontimeinvariant,i.e.,“static”magneticfields(which,as
mentioned,arecalled“SMFs”).Inthescientificliterature,itissometimesassumed
that EMFs with frequencies of less than 100 Hz have biological effects similar or
identical to SMFs (Markov 2014; Lohmann et al. 2022). However, in the current
chapter,weexclusivelyfocusonstudieswithoutatime-varyingcomponent.
4.3 Overview of Magnetoreception in Various Organisms
The ability to sense magnetic fields—or “magnetoreception”—has evolved across
almost all phyla of mobile organisms starting with ancient magnetotactic bacteria
thatexploittheGMFtomoveupordowninthewatercolumnandnematodesthat
also use magnetic fields to move vertically in the soil (Clites and Pierce 2017; Lin
etal.2020;Diego-RasillaandPhillips2021).Otheranimalsincludingamphibians,
butterflies, birds, and even mammals use the Earth’s magnetic field for navigation
during long distance migrations (Blanco et al. 2022; Lohmann et al. 2022). A
sampling of such magnetosensing organisms is provided below, along with brief
mechanistic insights. This information is not intended to be comprehensive but is
instead meant to provide an overview of known and postulated molecular mecha-
nisms found throughout nature as a prelude to a more detailed description of the
three“wellknown”modesofmagneticsensing(magnetite,chemical,andinductive)
inSect.4.3ofthischapter.

4.3.1 Bacteria
Magnetotactic bacteria were first described by Salvatore Bellini in a monograph
published in 1963 (Bellini 1963) with a seminal peer-reviewed report by Robert
Blakemore published 12 years later (Blakemore 1975), culminating finally in a
detailedreviewintheAnnualReviewofMicrobiologypublishedin1982(Blakemore
1982).Thesebacteriacontain“permanent”magnetsintheformofnano-sized(e.g.,
ofanaveragesizeof~420Å)cuboidal-tooctahedral-shapedirongrainsthatallow
them to orient themselves with the geomagnetic (0.25–0.65 gauss) or applied
magnetic fields. Upon orientation, which is entirely passive in nature (e.g., even
deadmagnetotacticbacteriabecomealignedwithanappliedmagneticfield),living
bacteria actively swim along the field in a predominantly northward direction for
bacteria harvested from the Northern Hemisphere and in a southward direction for
bacteriafromthesouthernhemisphere(Blakemore1982).

cope with stress associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ultraviolet
(UV) radiation before the Earth gained a substantial ozone layer. The resulting
iron-based biomolecules were proposed to be later co-opted for magnetoreception
(Lin et al. 2020). In particular, the iron nanoparticles evolved the ability to form
chainsofseveralmagnetosomestocreateamagneticmomentalongacell’smotility
axis, facilitating parallel orientation with the Earth’s magnetic field (Monteil and
Lefevre 2020). Finally, proteins have been identified that produce scaffolds for
magnetosome formation in magnetic-sensing bacterium; MamY is one membrane-
bound protein involved in this process that works with two organizing proteins
(MamK and MamJ) that actively organize magnetosomes (Toro-Nahuelpan et al.
2019).Althoughnotdirectlyrelatedtohumanhealthormagnetictherapyinpeople,
magnetotactic bacteria illustrate how even very “primitive” organisms have the
ability to exploit magnetic sensing to enhance survival and gain an evolutionary
advantageovercompetingspecies.
4.3.2 Plants
Areviewarticlepublishedin2014notedthatplantshaveseveralmeansofdetecting
geomagnetic fields, which affect their growth and development (Maffei 2014).
However, at the time, the biochemical mechanisms were poorly defined. In the
past few years, several mechanistic studies have been published to fill this void,

building on early studies in the field that posited that magnetosensitive responses
were best explained by the cryptochrome-based radical pair mechanism (Dhiman
and Galland 2018). Indeed, this mechanism is becoming increasingly well
established, being supported by several studies that show the magnetic responses
are co-dependent on the presence or absence of light (Agliassa et al. 2018; Pooam
et al. 2019). These studies, however, have extended our understanding of plant-
basedmagnetoreceptionbeyondcryptochromes.Forexample,inonestudy,expres-
sionoftheCAB-protein(chlorophylla,b-bindingprotein)ofArabidopsisresponded
to 188 μT even in the absence of cryptochromes 1 and 2, indicating that this plant
species had additional magnetosensing mechanisms. Nevertheless, cryptochrome
sensing was still involved because the magnetic field effects were substantially
enhanced under blue light, both negatively and positively (Dhiman and Galland
2018).
Arabidopsis responds to magnetic fields even under conditions of pulsed, blue
light exposure, suggesting that radical pair formation by static magnetic fields
“cannot act at a reaction step in the cryptochrome photocycle because these
radical-pair intermediates (Trp°/FADH° or Tyr°/FADH°) have reported lifetimes
only in the millisecond time scale” (Pooam et al. 2019). Ultimately, this study
concludesthatshort-lived,transientreactionsassociatedwithflavinphotoreduction
cannot transduce magnetic field exposure; rather, the radical pairs impacted by the
SMF must be formed during an extended period consistent withreoxidation of the
flavin. This process is light-independent, requires molecular oxygen (Müller and
Ahmad 2011), and involves the formation of ROS, leading to the conclusion that,
while cryptochromes are magnetosensing, they themselves are not the actual mag-
neticsensors(Agliassaetal.2018;Vanderstraetenetal.2018;Pooametal.2019).

4.3.3.1 Nematodes
The soil-dwelling nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans is well studied in a
laboratory setting and constitutes a facile model for investigation of “simple”
multicellular organisms. For example, all of this creature’s neurons are mapped,
allowingforexquisitelysensitiveinvestigationofbrainfunctionatthemolecularand
genetic levels. To complement and extend laboratory study of these nematodes,
Vidal-Gadea and coauthors reported fascinating magnetoreception in “wild”
C. elegans whose populations were isolated from different sites across the globe.
Thesegroupsmigratedatanglestoanappliedmagneticfieldthatoptimizedvertical
translation in their native soil, with northern- and southern-hemisphere worms
displayingoppositemigratorypreferences(Vidal-Gadeaetal.2015).Intheseexper-
iments, magnetotaxis was traced to genes expressed in the “amphid neurons with
finger-like ciliated endings” (AfD) that previously had been implicated in
thermosensation (Mori 1999). The specific genes involved in magnetotaxis in
these cells include: two independent mutant alleles of ttx-1, important for AfD
differentiation; the triple mutant lacking guanylyl cyclases, gcy-23, gcy-8, and
gcy-18, which together are critical for AfD function; and two independent mutant
alleles of each tax-4 and tax-2 genes that encode subunits of a cGMP-gated ion
channel implicated in stimuli transduction in sensory neurons (Vidal-Gadea et al.
2015).
Additionalfactorsthatcontributetonematodemagnetotaxishavebeenunraveled
infollow-upstudies(Vidal-Gadeaetal.2018;Bainbridgeetal.2019).Inparticular,
temperature,humidity,andcarbondioxidelevelswereexaminedanddiscountedas
possible alternative explanations for the worms’ apparent responses to magnetic
fields. Confirmation and new insights into biological mechanism were gained by
showing that AfD neurons’ calcium release profiles responded to alterations in
magnetic fieldstrengthororientation, andthat the nematodes’ability toalign with
magnetic fields was lost as they entered a starvation state (i.e., no food intake for
30 min)(Vidal-Gadea etal. 2018). At the organism level, the orientation of nema-
todes while changing direction under the influence of a magnetic field was exam-
ined. Itwasfoundthatnematodes preferacuteturns,aligningtheirbodies withthe
magneticfieldbefore determining theirultimate migratoryroute.Interestingly,this
processissimilartohowperiodicbodilyalignmentsinbirdsunderlietheir“compass
calibrationwithmagneticfields”(Bainbridgeetal.2019).Thereremainunexplained
aspects of nematode magnetotaxis as well. For example, the worms have an odd
preference for a leftward arcing trajectory toward the north magnetic pole (Vidal-
Gadeaetal.2018).

similar to nematodes, has been traced to specific neurons. In a series of studies
beginning in the late 1980s, Lohmann and colleagues reported that perturbation of
geomagnetic strength magnetic fields change electrical activity in a single neuron
(leftpedal5,LPd5)(Lohmannetal.1991).Subsequentexperimentsidentifiedfour
such neurons including LPd5, LPd6, RPd5, and RPd6 (Wang et al. 2004). These
neuronsfiredanincreasednumberofactionpotentialswhenthehorizontalcompo-
nentoftheambientmagneticfieldwasrotated.Thisresponsedisappearedwhenall
nerves emerging from the brain were cut, suggesting a peripheral locus for the
geomagnetic transducer (Popescu and Willows 1999) and leading to speculation
thatmagneticbiosensorsthataffectbrainfunction(ingeneral)“couldbeinthebig
toe,oranywhere”(Hand2016).
Inadditiontomollusks,crustaceansconstituteanotherprominentcategoryofsea
creatures that respond toGMFs as exemplified by the spiny lobster (Lohmann and
Ernst 2014). As Lohmann and Ersnt explain, spiny lobsters have a magnetic
compass of the polarity type, similar to salmon and mole rats, that determines
north using the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field (Lohmann and
Ernst 2014) [another type of magnetic compass found in nature is the inclination
compass used by birds, insects, amphibians, and reptiles such as sea turtles which
defines “poleward” as the direction where the angle between the magnetic field
vectorandgravityvectoristhesmallest(Váchaetal.2008;Wiltschkoetal.2021)].
To date, similar to mollusks and nematodes, where the actual molecular-level
biosensorremainsunknown,magnetoreceptorsincrustaceanshaveyettobedefin-
itivelyidentified.Onepossibilityisthatmagnetitenanoparticles~50nmindiameter
similar to those found in magnetotactic bacteria act as the receptors. Evidence in

receptors(BuskirkandO’BrienJr.2013)andcanalsohavetheirpreferredorienta-
tion deflected by re-magnetization of the putative magnetite particles in a different
direction (Lohmann and Ernst 2014). A recent study found that ~10% of genes
expressed in the central nervous system of spiny lobsters (Panulirus argus), a
species of magnetically sensitive invertebrates, were differentially expressed in
response to a magnetic pulse known to alter magnetic orientation behavior (Ernst
etal.2020).Thisstudyfoundthatmanyofthealteredgenesencodeproteinslinked

andErnst2014).
4.3.3.3 Insects
Crustaceans are arthropods, a phylum shared with insects; consequently it is not
surprising that insects also provide numerous examples of magnetoreception and
magnetotaxis including ants, bees, moths, and butterflies (de Oliveira et al. 2010;
Dreyer et al. 2018; Wan et al. 2021). Magnetoreception has been particularly well
studiedinbees,nodoubtbecauseoftheiragriculturalimportanceaspollinators.This
role critically depends on their direction finding ability and innate compass (Vale
andAcosta-Avalos2021),whichallowsthemtofindand“remember”thelocationof
foodsourcesoverdistancesuptofivekilometersaway.Anearlystudyshowedthat
bees have magnetic remanence consistent with the presence of magnetite (Gould
etal.1978);subsequentelectronparamagneticresonance(EPR)imagingofhoney-
bees showed magnetite was primarily located in the insects’ abdomens (El-Jaick
etal.2001;Lambinetetal.2017;Shawetal.2018).
Despite decades of study, the precise mechanism of magnetoreception in bees
remains controversial. For example, bumblebees have iron-based granules
exhibiting magnetic character located not only in their abdomens, as found in
honeybees, but also at peripheral sites on their wings and heads (Jandacka et al.
2015). In addition to iron-based sensing, titanium appears to be utilized for
magnetoreception in some species of Hymenoptera such as the migratory ant
Pachycondyla marginata (Wajnberg et al. 2017; Fleischmann et al. 2020), thereby
providing new models for how magnetite-based direction finding could work in
these insects. Some evidence suggests that honeybees may have a dual sensing
system that includes photochemical reactions (Válková and Vácha 2012;
Fleischmann et al. 2018). Other studies have downplayed complementary mecha-
nisms based on evidence that honeybee magnetoreception works in the total dark,
wheretherequisite initiatingphotochemical reactionsarenotpossible(Liangetal.
2016) (the radical pairs mechanism discussed in detail in Sect. 4.3.2 explains the
requirement for light for chemical magnetoreception). Support for dual-sensor
magnetoreceptionininsectsisprovidedbyvertebrates—inparticularseveralspecies
ofbirds—thatappeartorelyonbothmagnetiteandchemicalmagnetoreceptionfor
directionfindingandmigrationoververylongdistances.Anotherpossibilityisthat
bees and ants have both types of sensors that work independently, with chemical
magnetosensing acting as a backup mechanism (Dovey et al. 2013; Fleischmann
etal.2020).

4.3.4 Vertebrates
4.3.4.1 Overview
The discussion up to now covered several “ancient” organisms that have unique
biological abilities that often do not carry over to more advanced phyla such as
vertebrates(forexample,althoughmagnetiteappearsinmoreadvancedanimals,the
specializedarrangementoftheironcrystalsintomagnetosomesobservedinbacteria
has not been found above the prokaryotic level). It is clear, however, that
magnetoreception is found in many higher organisms including vertebrates and, at
least in some cases, detection of the magnetic fields relies on non-magnetite-based
biosensors. For example, several types of fish—exemplified by sharks—have spe-
cializedelectricalsensingorgansthatarethoughttoalsoprovidemagnetoreception
through induction, as discussed in Sect. 4.3.3. Other species, such as salmon, use
magneticfieldsfornavigationovervastdistancesintheopenoceanandforreturning
to the precise site of their birth to procreate, requiring the correct choice between
multipleriver junctions asthey move upstream. In addition, many amphibians and
reptiles have the ability to detect magnetic fields, but these examples will not be
described further. Instead, we will briefly cover fish (Sect. 4.3.4.2) before moving
onto birds (Sect. 4.3.4.3), where chemical magnetoreception (Sect. 4.3.2) has
become well established. We will then cover mammals (Sect. 4.3.4.4) who share
many biological similarities with humans and thus provide a reasonable scientific
foundation to explain how magnetic fields can influence biological responses and
worktherapeuticallyinpeople.
4.3.4.2 Fish
Fishwasoneofthefirstgroupsofanimalsstudiedwithrespecttomagnetoreception
becauseoftheirextensivemigratorypatternsthatdependofGMFs(Formickietal.
2019). Early studies connected the ability of elasmobranchs (rays, skates, sharks,
etc.) to both detect electrical fields and the magnetic field of the Earth, orienting
themselves with these fields in the ocean (Murray 1960). There were soon many
studiesthatestablishedthatmultiplefishspecieswerecapableofmagnetoreception
(Fommel and McCleave 1973; Quinn 1980; Quinn and Brannon 1982; Chew and
Brown1989;Oguraetal.1992;Paulin1995).Theprimaryreceptorsthatdetectand
respond to magnetic cues in fish have yet to be unambiguously established
(Anderson et al. 2017). Magnetite, however, has been widely assumed to be
involved (Kirschvink et al. 2001; Naisbett-Jones et al. 2020). That said, without
anycurrentlyknownreceptorsorsynapticconnections,itremainsunclearhowthis
information is processed by the fish. An interesting magnetosensing mechanism

andVortman2017;Boggs2020).
4.3.4.3 Birds
Magnetoreception has been described in many birds (Wiltschko and Wiltschko
2019)—and indeed may be ubiquitous across the avian world—including remark-
able examples such as the arctic tern that literally navigates from one end of the
globe to the other. Although traveling shorter distances, the homing pigeon exem-
plifiesprecisiondirectionfindingabilitythatusesmagneticcues;mechanistically,a
pigeon’shomingabilitywasfirstreportedtodependonmagnetite-basedreceptorsin

independent manner (Nimpf et al. 2019). These magnetoreceptors, however, only
record magnetic intensity and as such, are just one component of a bird’s multi-
factorialnavigation mappingability. Increasing evidence suggeststhat birds, remi-
niscentofbeeswhereadualsensingsystemforGMFshasbeenproposed,useboth
magnetite and photoreceptors; as a caveat, not all studies have found evidence for
magnetite-basedmagnetoreceptioninpigeons(Malkemperetal.2019).
The light-sensing ability of birds has been linked to cryptochrome proteins,
whoseunderlyingchemistryisdescribedinmoredetailinSect.4.3.2.Brieflyhere,
these proteins have long been known to participate in circadian rhythms when
located inthe nuclei of certain retinal cells. Bolte and coworkers discovered forms
ofcryptochrome(Cry1aandCry1b)inthecytosolofretinalcellsinmigratorybirds
(e.g.,Europeanrobinsandhomingpigeons)thatdependonbothlightandmagnetic
fields for direction finding (Bolte et al.2016). The unique cytosolic localization of
these cryptochromes suggests that they are not involved in circadian rhythms;
instead, their non-nuclear localization implicates their involvement in
photosensing-based magnetoreception. In recent years, cryptochrome 4a (Cry4a)
has been increasingly linked to a combined light-sensing magnetoreception mech-
anism in birds (Günther et al. 2018; Pinzon-Rodriguez et al. 2018). Interestingly,
Cry4a contains 4 radical-pair states, compared to3normally foundinother organ-
isms like plants, leading to the hypothesis that the fourth pair evolved to initiate
magneticsignalingbyinteractionwithanearbytyrosineresidue(Wongetal.2021).

4.3.4.4 Mammals
Theelucidationofmagnetoreceptioninmammalshaslaggedbehindothertypesof
organisms such as bacteria and birds where much is now known (even though
mysteries remain). Nevertheless, even a decade ago, there were intriguing pieces
ofevidencesupportingmagneticfieldsensinginmammals(Begalletal.2014).This
preliminary evidence suggested that mammals, human’s closest evolutionary rela-
tives,dorespondtomagneticfieldsinseveralways.Inparticular,magnetoreception
studies have suggested that mammals can utilize GMFs for homing and direction
findingbyexploitingcertainmagnetotacticabilitiesdocumentedacrossotherphyla.
Briefly, these studies showed that cetaceans can migrate thousands of kilometers
based on magnetic cues (Granger et al. 2020); moles rats have brain neurons
sensitive to magnetic stimuli that affect nest building orientation (Němec et al.
2001; Caspar et al. 2020); other rodents displaced hundreds of meters (or more)
from their homes can return successfully based in part on magnetic homing; bats
preferentially build nests aligned to magnetic fields and have similar roosting
preferences attributed to magnetic-sensing components of the cornea (Lindecke
et al. 2021); and cattle, sheep, deer and even dogs preferentially (for reasons
otherwiseunclear)aligntheirbodiesalongN–Smagneticaxes(Begalletal.2014).
Indications are emerging that mammals can exploit geomagnetism for reasons
beyond direction finding and homing. For example, the success of red foxes in
hunting mice is correlated with the alignment of the direction of jumping attacks
withGMFswhenthefox’svisionisobscuredbysnoworhighvegetation(Červený
et al. 2011). Relevant to the ultimate objective of this chapter and book—which is
the evaluation of magnetic field therapy in humans—mice (presumably when safe
from being hunted from red foxes) experience changes in stress-induced analgesia
(the inability to feel pain) dependent on SMF exposure (Betancur et al. 1994).
Subsequentstudiesshowedthatshieldingoftheambientmagneticfieldstoproduce
hypomagnetic fields (HMFs) reduces stress-induced analgesia in rodents (Choleris
etal.2002;Pratoetal.2005).Theseandothersimilarstudieshaveestablishedthat
exposure, or in other cases a lack of exposure, to magnetic fields can affect
mammalian biology in biomedically relevant ways. Importantly, in theory these
effects be complemented, augmented, and amplified by using stronger field

were observed in diabetic mice (Shang et al. 2019), and a modest improvement in
respiratory rate and other aspects of lung health were observed in mice subject to
radiation damage to the lungs (Rubinstein et al. 2018). There are even indications
that SMF treatment elicits anti-cancer responses in mice by decreasing telomerase
expression and cell migration (Fan et al. 2020), or in combination with immuno-
therapeuticssuchascetuximab(Gellrichetal.2018).Anotherinterestingstudybuilt

4.4 Types of Biological Magnetoreceptors
The overview of magnetoreception provided above in Sect. 4.2 highlighted two
major molecular-level mechanisms underlying magnetic field detectionacross sev-
eralclassesofdiverseorganisms.Thefirst,andmostprevalent,istheexploitationof
magnetite across many types of life for direction finding and additional biological
responses (magnetite is discussed further in Sect. 4.3.1). Evidence is also consoli-
dating behind the chemistry-based radical pairs mechanism (RPM) as a second
modality for magnetoreception. There have been various biological iterations of
the RPM in which cryptochrome proteins are putatively utilized by organisms
ranging from bumblebees to birds as part of their magnetic compass, and even to
micewherepainsensingwasfoundcloseto30yearsagotobemodulatedbyboth
light andmagnetic fieldexposure(Betancuretal.1994).Cryptochromes andother
chemistry-based possibilities for magnetoreception are discussed further in Sect.
4.3.2. Finally, a third more specialized mode of magnetic field detection, electrical
induction,iscoveredinSect.4.3.3.
4.4.1 Magnetite
4.4.1.1 StructureandBiosynthesisinProkaryotes
Magnetite can be considered to be the original biological magnetoreceptor. The
“original”designationisbasedbothonevolutionaryhistorywithmagnetitepresent

Bazylinski 2013), and because it was the first magnetic biosensor discovered and

(Arakaki et al. 2008; Murat et al. 2010; Lower and Bazylinski 2013; Mirabello
etal.2016;Ben-ShimonandZarivach2021).
4.4.1.2 DistributionandFunctioninHigherOrganismsIncluding
Humans
Magnetite has been discovered and studied across many species; it has now been
detected in crustaceans, insects, birds, salmon, sea turtles, and other animals (even
mammals such as cattle) that can orient themselves with respect to the Earth’s
magnetic field. Indeed, a recent examination of 13 eukaryotes found
11 magnetosome gene homologs universally present, leading to speculation that
magnetitebiomineralizationrepresentsanexampleofdeephomologyacrosseukary-
oticlife(Bellingeretal.2022).Inpractice,thepresenceofmagnetiteinpeoplehas
beenreportedinthehumanbrain(Kirschvinketal.1992;Gilderetal.2018;Khan
andCohen2018;Wangetal.2019)aswellasintheheart,spleen,andliver(Grassi-
Schultheiss et al. 1997; Schultheiss-Grassi et al. 1999). Magnetite isolated from
higher animals typically exists as single-domain crystals similar to those found as
chains in magnetosomes in magnetotactic bacteria (Johnsen and Lohmann 2008).
The origin and source of magnetite in higher organisms such as people remain
unclear because counterparts to biosynthetic and structure-organizing genes in
bacteria [Mms5, Mms6, Mms7 (MamD), Mms13 (MamC), MamF, ManG, and
MmsF (Mirabello et al. 2016)] do not seem to be present in eukaryotes. Neverthe-
less,spontaneous chemical crystallization ofmagnetite,while resulting indifferent
size distributions and shapes than found in bacteria, can remain active for
magnetoreception(KahaniandYagini2014;Leãoetal.2020).
Mechanistically, there are several postulated ways for magnetite crystals to
transduce geomagnetic field information to the nervous or other organ systems.
Thesemechanismsareguidedbylessonslearnedfrombacteria,whereeachmagne-
titecrystalissurroundedbyseveralproteinsandamembraneconnectedtothecell

couldbetransducedtosecondaryreceptors(such asstretchreceptors,haircells,or
mechanoreceptors);anotherpossibilityisthattherotationofintracellularmagnetite
crystals might directly or indirectly open ion channels (Cadiou and McNaughton
2010).
Indirect evidence for physical connections between magnetite and the cytoskel-
eton comes from the aforementioned studies where shrimp and barnacles that
experience disorientation upon demagnetization (Buskirk and O’Brien Jr. 2013)
can have their preferred orientation deflected by re-magnetization of the putative
magnetiteparticlesinadifferentdirection(LohmannandErnst2014).Ifmagnetite
crystalscouldfreelyrotate,theywouldquicklyadoptrandomorientationsinconsis-
tent with these effects, which require all (or at least some) of the magnetite in the
organism’s body remain aligned in a certain way. Accordingly, magnetite presum-
ablymustbetetheredtolargerbiomacromolecules,suchasthecytoskeleton(which

4.4.2.1 Background:TheChemicalBasisoftheRadicalPair
Mechanism(RPM)
Chemicalreactionsthatproceedthroughradicalintermediatescanbeinfluencedby
magnetic field effects (MFEs) that alter reaction rate, yield, or product distribution
(Rodgers 2009); the “radical pair mechanism” (RPM) underlies these effects. An
RPM-influencedreactionbeginswhenaground-stateprecursorspecies(e.g.,“Aand
B”) are excited to produce two singlet radicals, i.e., a spin-correlated radical pair
(RP);thesingletRPelectronscanthenundergoaspin-selectivereactiontoproduce
the singlet product (Fig. 4.3). However, if coherent evolution of the spin state
converts singlet RPs to triplet RPs on a similar (or faster) time scales as singlet
product formation, the triplet product can be formed, resulting in either different

discussedabove.
Cryptochrome reactions depend on continuous photoexcitation (Kattnig et al.
2016), explaining the requirement for both light and the presence of a magnetic
field—i.e., the “dual sensing” mechanisms mentioned above for bees, birds, and
mice.InanRPMreaction,thepresence,absence,relativestrength,andorientationof

play a similar electrosensing role (Phillips et al. 2020). Interestingly, mucin-like,
glycan-rich macromolecules in various mammalian species such as the Guiana

4.4.3.2 The“HallEffect”—RelevanceBeyondSpecialized
ElectroreceptiveOrgans?
The Hall effect has been—at least on the internet—used to explain the effects of
magneticfieldsinbiologicalsettingsinsomeclearlymisguidedways.Forexample,
one claim is that electrons (being regarded as “charged particles”) orbiting the
nucleus of an atom (i.e., they are presumed to be moving in space) are propelled
to higher velocities, thereby enhancing chemical reactivity. In reality, applied
magnetic fields only influence chemical reactivity through electron spin effects via
the specialized RPM reactions described above in Sect. 4.3.2. Another common
misconception is that the Hall effect can be used to explain changes to blood flow
observed upon magnetic field exposure. While it is true that blood does contain

explanation for responses observed in humans, spurring speculation in Sect. 4.4.2
about“other”possibilities.
4.5.1 “Established” Biosensors/Magnetoreceptors
4.5.1.1 Magnetite
Over the past 30 years, there have been periodic reports of magnetic iron (i.e.,
magnetite) in the human body with some of these studies being debunked because
of possible contamination (Hand 2016). For context, many of these studies came
from the same era when aluminum “contamination” from cooking utensils and
containers was (in retrospect implausibly) linked to plaques associated with
Alzheimer’s disease (Savory et al. 1996). Other reports of magnetite in humans,
however,haveremainedplausible.OnesuchstudywaspublishedintheProceedings
oftheNationalAcademy(USA)thatreporteddetailedparametersaboutmagnetite-
like iron assemblages in the human brain (Kirschvink et al. 1992). These crystal
structures resembled magnetite from magnetotactic bacteria and fish and were
present at minimum levels of five million single-domain crystals per gram for
mosttypesofbraintissues.Certainregionsofthebrain(e.g.,pia-anddura-derived
samples) had ~20-fold higher levels; further, the magnetite occurred in clumps of
50–100 crystals. The magnetite nanoparticles distributed (orbased on thenumbers
outlined in the next section, a better description might be “sparsely scattered”)
through neuronal and astroglial membranes have been proposed to play roles in
perception, transduction, and storage of information that arrives to the neocortex
(Banaclochaetal.2010).
Toprovidecontextforthesefindings,1gofbraintissuehasroughlyonebillion
cells. Accordingly, if the magnetite clumps were intracellular, only about one in
500 to one in 20,000 cells—depending on the exact size of the clumps and which
partofthebrainwasunderanalysis—couldcontainamagnetiteclump.Iftheclumps
wereextracellular[whichisnotconsistentwiththeproposedroleofmagnetite-based
force/signal transduction in eukaryotic cells, as outlined in Fig. 4.2 (Cadiou and
McNaughton2010)],additionalcellscouldbedirectlyimpactedby,orinteractwith,
the magnetite. Either way, based on the reported amount of magnetite, only a
relatively fraction of brain cells could be involved in magnetoreception through a
magnetite-basedmechanism.
Anothercomparisonisthathoneybeeshaveapproximately108magnetitecrystals
intheirbodies(KirschvinkandGould1981);basedonamassof~100mg,abeehas
~109 (onebillion) copies ofmagnetite pergram orabout 200-foldmore on amass
basis. While it is at least theoretically plausible that only a minor subset of human
neuralcellsmightbeinvolvedinmagnetosensing,thesearchforthesecellsconsti-
tutes a veritable “needle in the haystack” scenario. In the three decades, since this
PNASreportwaspublished(Kirschvinketal.1992),magnetoreceptionviamagne-
tite in the human brain remains unproven. Showing remarkable persistence,

however, the lead author of the PNAS study, Joe Kirschvink, has continued to
pursue the possibility of magnetic sensing in the human brain and was featured in
a Science (the magazine) news article describing how he and his colleagues are
embarkingonthenextgenerationofstudiestopursuetheelusivegoalofobtaining
“definitive” proof for magnetotherapy or other magnetic field effects in humans
(Hand2016).
4.5.1.2 ChemicalMagnetoreceptionViaCryptochromes
As just mentioned, efforts to confirm that magnetoreception exists in humans
continue with exciting new initiatives being planned (Hand 2016; Chae et al.
2019). It should be noted that in addition to the decades old hypothesis that the
humanbrain(andothertissue)containsmagnetite,humansmayhaveadualsensing
system similar tobees,birds,andmicebasedoncryptochromes.Twocomplemen-
tary lines of evidence support this idea. First, geomagnetic fields can influence the
light sensitivity of the human visual system (Thoss et al. 2000, 2002), evoking
cryptochrome-basedsystemsfoundinotherspecies.Second,abiochemicalfounda-
tion for this hypothesis is falling into place. In particular, humans express two
cryptochromes (hCRY1 and hCRY2) in their eyes showing that—at least in
theory—humans have the biochemical machinery for chemical magnetoreception
(upto now, these proteins haveprimarily beenlinkedtocircadian rhythms). Foley
and coworkers performed a critical experiment in support of this hypothesis by
taking a transgenic cross-species approach to show that hCRY2, which is heavily
expressed in the retina, can function as a magnetic field sensor in the
magnetoreception system of Drosophila in a light-dependent manner (Foley et al.
2011). Although this result showed that hCRY2 has the molecular capability to
function as a light-sensitive magnetosensor, it must be emphasized that as-of-yet
there is no firm evidence that hCRY proteins function in magnetosensing roles in
humans or even in other mammals such as dogs and apes that exhibit certain
GMF-sensing abilities and, perhaps entirely coincidentally, express cryptochromes
intheretina(Nießneretal.2016).Inconcertwithbiochemicalevidencethathumans
have light-sensing magnetoreception machinery, there are reports that people can
respondbehaviorally.Forexample,onestudyshowedthatfood-deprivedmen(but
notwomen)usedgeomagneticcuesfororientation(Chaeetal.2019).

was biologically significant, the overall circulation of the blood easily could be
affected.Inreality,anyinductive“Halleffect”forceistooweaktomeasurablyaffect
blood constituents. Secondly, there is considerable confusion and misinformation
that iron in RBCs is “magnetic.” Clearly it is not ferromagnetic because it is not
organized in crystalline magnetite form. Iron in RBCs, however, is paramagnetic,
which can have diagnostic value with certain caveats. For example, a paper from
1961 titled “Problems in the Measurement of Blood Flow by Magnetic Induction”
(Wyatt1961)reportedtechnicalissuesthatbedeviledalreadythen20yearoldefforts
to exploit the electromagnetic fields generated by movement of paramagnetic iron
foundinRBCstomeasurebloodcirculation.
In the intervening years, the study of iron in RBCs under the influence of
magnetic fields has become increasinglysophisticated. For example, a 2003 publi-
cationbyZborowskietal.(2003)outlinedthemagnetophoreticmobilityofdifferent
populationsofdeoxyandoxygenatederythrocytes(i.e.,RBCs).Thisstudyshowed
that, with the development of a new technology, cell tracking velocimetry, it was
possibletomeasurethemigration velocity of deoxygenated and metHb-containing
erythrocytesexposedtoamagneticfieldof1.4T(i.e.a,MRI-strengthfield).Inthis
study, erythrocytes with 100% deoxygenated hemoglobin had a magnetophoretic
mobilityof3.86×10 -6mm3s/kgcomparedto3.66×10 -6mm3s/kgforerythro-
cytes containing 100% metHb; in other words, both of these forms of hemoglobin
displayed paramagnetic properties. By comparison, oxygenated erythrocytes had
magnetophoretic mobilities ranging from -0.2 × 10 -6 mm3 s/kg to +0.30 × 10 -6,
indicatingthatthesecellswereprimarilydiamagnetic(Zborowskietal.2003).The
detection and analysis of these properties have matured since 2003, allowing
dielectrophoretic and magnetophoretic methods to now be used for diagnosis of
medical conditions such as malaria parasite-infected red blood cells (Kasetsirikul
etal.2016).
AlthoughRBCscannowbestudiedandleveragedfordiagnosticmedicaltestsby
exploitingtheirmagneticproperties,itislessclearthatexternallyappliedmagnetic
fieldshavelegitimatetherapeuticeffectsonbloodcirculation,asisoftenclaimedby
vendors of “magnetic therapy” products. In particular, the impact of applied mag-
neticfieldsonunpairedelectronsincontextsotherthanRPMreactions(asdiscussed
above)isnegligibleunderweak(i.e.,geomagneticstrength)fields,andevenstrong
(i.e., 1.3–3 T MRI-strength fields) have negligible “chemical” effects. Indeed, a
comparisontheimpactoflowerfieldstrengthsfrom~6to40mTshowednegligible,
inconsistent, and variable effects on platelet and RBC counts, hemoglobin, hemat-
ocrit, and other blood-related parameters in rats (Mustafa et al. 2020). The lack of
any such clear effect is evidenced in rather lax regulatory oversight by agencies
including the US FDA, which allows “wellness” magnetic field devices to be
marketed to “treat” almost any type of ailment because safety is not an issue
(Anonymous 2015). As a caveat, the word “treat” in the previous sentence is not
completely accurate in a medical sense because the FDA specifically prohibits
claims oftherapeuticefficacyagainstanyparticulardiseaseconditionformagnetic
fieldgeneratingdevices.

brains in living nematodes to uncover specific neurons involved in
magnetoreception)cannotbeperformedinhumans.Inaway,ethical(commonsense,

blessing in disguise, forcing researchers to use cell lines a surrogate for in vivo
testing.Thesestudieshaveledtothediscoveryofresponsestomagneticfieldsatthe
cell level that do not involve any of the three “established” modes of
magnetoreception. For example, immobilized cells maintained in dark incubators
with unchanging SMFs are not expected to exhibit chemical magnetosensing
(becausethey’rekeptinthedark)orinduction(becausetheydonotmove);similarly,
there is no plausible mechanism for the presence of magnetite in these cells. To
brieflyillustratethispoint,wenextmentionbothanoutsideexamplebasedonHMF

theCytoskeleton
Recently,MoandcoauthorsfoundthatHMFsrepressexpressionsofgenesassoci-
ated with cell migration and cytoskeleton assembly in human neuroblastoma cells
grown in cell culture conditions that were not plausibly subject to any of the
magnetite, chemical magnetoreception, or induction mechanisms (Mo et al. 2016).
Going beyond analysis of gene expression, they showed that HMF modulated
“whole cell” behaviors in SH-SY5Y cells including control of cell morphology,
adhesion, and motility, tracing these changes to the actin cytoskeleton. This study
suggested that the elimination of the geomagnetic field affects the assembly of the
motility-related actin cytoskeleton, and implicates F-actin as a target of HMF
exposure and positions it as a potential novel mediator of GMF sensation
(Moetal.2016).Inamorerecentstudy,thecytoskeletonofosteocyteswasaltered
by SMF exposure along with changes to cellular morphology, function-related
protein expression, cytokine secretion, and iron metabolism (Yang et al. 2021a);

4.5.2.3 SMFEffectsonLipidMembranesandDownstreamSignaling
The author’s laboratory has published two studies (Wang et al. 2009, 2010) that
implicatebiologicalmembranesasthe“biosensor”formagneticfieldsintheappar-
entabsenceofcanonicalchemical(i.e.,cryptochrome-mediated)ormagnetitemech-
anisms. These studies were based on literature reports that SMFs alter the
biophysical properties of lipids (Braganza et al. 1984) and by extension, higher
order structures such as lipid bilayers (Rosen 2003b; De Nicola et al. 2006;
Nuccitelli et al. 2006). Based on these studies, we postulated that biological
membraneswereaplausible“biosensor”formagnetoreceptionincellcultureinves-
tigations where magnetite was absent and the cells involved had no obvious light-
sensing ability. Further, based on the threshold of ~0.2 T reportedly required for
SMFs to have an impact on biological membranes (Braganza et al. 1984), we
undertooktwostudies where cells were treated with0.23–0.28 TSMFs(the varia-
tionisduetodifferentplacementoftissuecultureplatesintheincubatordevice,see
Fig.4.1).
In one study, in part spurred by clinical efforts to use ~0.3 T SMFs to treat

2A
pharmacological agent—must elicit cellular responses through a fundamentally
different mode of action. A plausible mechanism, outlined in cartoon form in
Fig.4.4,isthat~0.25TSMFexposuredirectly alters thebiophysicalpropertiesof
lipid bilayers, which in turn rapidly modulates ion channel activity (Rosen 2003a)
and thereby perturbs the intra-and extracellular levels of Ca2+ levels (Wang et al.
2009,2010).

performed for the network linked to the inflammatory cytokine interleukin
6 (IL-6). We found a biphasic response to SMF exposure (Fig. 4.5) where short-
term (<4 h) activation of IL-6 mRNA expression occurred with coordinated
up-regulation of toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and ST3GAL5, phosphorylation of

LacCer; at the same time loss of the biosynthetic enzyme ST3GAL5 prevents
regeneration of GM3 (as well as other gangliosides such as GM1). The net effect
ofthisfunctionallycoordinatedresponseisdiminutionofcellsurfacelevelsofGM3,
whichwepreviouslyshowedcanaffectcellsurfacesignaling(Wangetal.2006)and
others have shown affect gangliosides’ ability to modulate calcium ion activity
(Carlson et al. 1994). Accordingly, we speculate that SMF exposure immediately
affects calcium ion channel activity through changes to the bulk biophysical prop-
erties of the surrounding membranes. This sets in motion a series of events that
ultimatelycounteracttheimpactofSMF.Inotherwords,theinitialstimulipresented

4.5.2.5 LipidMembranesasaMagneticFieldBiosensor—Revisiting
EarlierEvidence
Inadditiontothespeculativemechanismjustpresented,webrieflyrevisitmagnetic
sensinginnematodes(Sect.4.3.3.1),wherespecificneuronshavebeenidentifiedto
be responsive to the GMF. Early studies, consistent with findings in mollusks and
crustaceans(Sect.4.3.3.2),suggestedthattheactualbiosensorwasperipheraltothe
neuronsfoundtorespondtomagneticfields.Amorerecentstudy,however,provides
convincing evidence that the neurons themselves have magnetic-sensing ability of
activatedcalciumfluxandactivationintheabsenceofsynapticinput(Vidal-Gadea
etal.2015).Thisinformationisconsistentwithourcell-basedfindingswhereSMF
exposureofhumanneural-likecellsappearedtodirectlyinteractwithmembranesto
triggerdownstreamresponse.Acounterpointtothishypothesis,however,isthatthe
nematode study monitored GMF-strength magnetic fields, which are much weaker
than the ~0.2 T fields previously described as necessary for direct “magnetic field
sensing”bychangestothebiophysicalpropertiesofmembranes;indeed,nematodes
havebiogeneticmagnetite(Cranfieldetal.2004).Toconclude,membranes—inand
ofthemselves—mayprovideaddedmodesofmagneticfieldbiosensingnotdetected
up to now. Similar to many aspects of “magnetobiology,” confirmation of this
possibilityprovidesexcitingfutureresearchopportunities.

4.6 Concluding Comments
Thischapterrevisits,albeitbriefly,magneticfieldbiosensingabilitiesfoundacross
many diverse organisms and attempts to apply the information that has been
compiled over the past half century or so to prospects for “magnetotherapy” in
humans (this concept is extended in Chap. 15). As covered above, “Nature” has
evolved two well-established modes of magnetoreception (magnetite and
cryptochromeRPMmechanisms)aswellasamorespecializedinductivemechanism
exemplified by certain fish that have “ampullae of Lorenzini” sensing organs. As
summarized in Sect. 4.5, these mechanisms do not provide a fully compelling
explanation for effects of magnetic field exposure in human cells, resulting in
speculativemodels(inpartbasedonthisauthor’spreviousresearch)wheremoderate
strengthSMFsdirectlymodulatethebiophysicalpropertiesofbiologicalmembranes
with profound consequences on downstream signaling pathways, gene expression,
andultimatelycellfate.

Controlling Cell Membrane Potential
with Static Nonuniform Magnetic Fields
VitaliiZablotskii,TatyanaPolyakova,andAlexandrDejneka
Abstract The coordinated activity of a myriad of ion channels in a cell is a
spectacular biological and physical phenomenon. Understanding mechanisms
governing the ion channel gating and setting membrane potentials is key to devel-
opingtargetedtherapeuticstrategiesusingnon-contactmagneticstimulations.Inthis
study,wedemonstratetheoreticallythationchannelactivitycanbecontrolledbya
static gradient magnetic field. The analysis revealed that specific ion membrane
channels can be turned off and on by remotely applying a high-gradient magnetic
field, thus modulating the cell membrane potential. The suggested model and
mechanisms provide a general framework for identifying possible hidden mecha-
nismsofbiomagneticeffectsassociatedwithmodulationofionchannelactivityby
high-gradientstaticmagneticfields.

signals,cancerprogression,andwoundhealing(YangandBrackenbury2013;Levin
2014, 2020; Abdul Kadir et al. 2018). Although it is much known how membrane
potentialandbioelectricalsignalscontrolcellbehavior,manymysteriesremain,e.g.,
how undifferentiated and cancer cells can maintain a low membrane potential,
allowing them to be mitotically active and highly plastic. In contrast, mature,
terminally differentiated, and quiescent cells are prone to hyperpolarization and
usually do not undergo mitosis (Fig. 5.1). Another physical parameter governing
cell life is membrane rigidity. Importantly, both these parameters (MP and mem-
branerigidity)arenotindependent:thecellmembranerigidityisproportionaltothe
squareofthemembranevoltage(Zablotskiietal.2016b).Thus,forcellswithahigh
membrane potential (Fig. 5.1), the electrostatic contribution to membrane bending
rigidity(Delormeetal.2007)issufficientlylarge,andthereforetheforcenecessary
to deform a cell membrane is enhanced in comparison with cells having low
membrane voltage (depolarized membrane). Hence, by tuning MPs, one can also
control cell rigidity, which might be important for cancer cells that have paradoxi-
cally small membrane potentials allowing them to be very plastic and invasive
(Zablotskii et al. 2018). Taken together, these facts may lead to the thought that
the functions and fate of cells are mainly determined by the magnitude of the
membrane potential. On the other hand, it is known that the whole-cell machinery
andcellfatecanbedramaticallyaffectedbystaticmagneticfields.Thereareseveral
examples.Exposureofmacrophagestoanon-uniformmagneticfieldcausesextreme

geometry of the early cell cleavages of Xenopus laevis eggs (Denegre et al. 1998)
and change orientation and morphology of mitotic spindles in human cells (Zhang
et al. 2017). A moderate static MF can dysregulate DNA replication (Yang et al.
2020).
Sincethemembranepotentialcorrelateswithmitosis,DNAsynthesis,cellcycle
progression, and overall proliferation (Cone 1971; Binggeli and Weinstein 1986),
the ability to control MPs with a magnetic field may represent a new tool for cell
therapyinvariousdiseases.Thus,theremoteandnoninvasivecontroloflivingcells
using magnetic fields is an attractive perspective for many researchers working in
biologyandmedicine.
ThemechanismsgoverningthecellMPareextensive,andionchannel-dependent

framework of regulating of ion channel expression and controlling MP with static

5.2 Magnetic Forces
Ingeneral,themagnetic forcesarecentraltocell responsestoanappliedmagnetic
field(MF).
There are three types of magnetic forces acting on moving ions, cells, and
subcellular components: (1) the Lorentz force, which is proportional to the ion
velocity and charge; (2) magnetic gradient forces, F∇B / ∇ B2 (where B is the
magnetic induction and ∇ is the differential operator nabla) (Hinds et al. 2001;
Zablotskiietal.2016a);and(3)theconcentration-gradientmagneticforce,F∇n /B2
∇n(where∇nisthegradientoftheconcentrationofthediamagneticorparamagnetic
species)(Waskaas1993;LeventisandGao2002;BundandKuehnlein2005;Dunne
etal.2011;SvendsenandWaskaas2020).
Itshouldbeemphasizedherethatacellisanelectricalunit,inwhichtheelectrical
(Coulomb)forcescontrolmanyintracellularprocesses.Incells,theelectricalforces
often dominate the magnetic forces. For example, the Lorentz force acting on
moving intracellular ions could be comparable to the intracellular Coulomb forces
inmagneticfieldswithaninductionlargerthan106T(Zablotskiietal.2018).Incell
systems, the magnetic forces can be sufficient in magnitude to compete with the
electric forces either in spatially inhomogeneous magnetic fields with extremely
large magnetic gradients (Zablotskii et al. 2016a, b, 2018; Barbic 2019) or in
uniform MFs with high magnetic field strength (Zhang et al. 2017). Thus, in such
magneticfields,themagneticforcescancompeteandinterferewithelectricalforces
andtherebychangethecellfunctionality.Forexample,inlivingtissuesandcells,a
static magnetic field with the gradient of the order of 1000 T/m generates the
magnetic gradient forces with the same volume density as that of gravity,
f = ρg ≈ 104 Nm -3 (Zablotskii et al. 2018) (here ρ is the cell mass density and
g
gistheaccelerationoffreefall).Incells,dependingonthemagneticsusceptibilities
of cell organelles and gradient value, the magnetic gradient forces reach (10–100)
pN (Zablotskii et al. 2016a) and therefore can alter the cell machinery. Here, we
employanalyticalmodelstoinvestigatehowthecellmembranepotentialchangesin
high-gradientstaticmagneticfields.
Many molecules and ions that determine the membrane potential have small
magneticmomentsmainlyduetonuclearspinsandhencetheyaresubjectedtothe
magnetic gradient forces. However, despite small values of these magnetic
moments, a high-gradient magnetic field can act on crossing cell membrane ions
with a relatively large force. These magnetic gradient forces can either assist or
opposeionmovementthroughthemembrane.Themagneticforceisgivenby

From Eq. (5.9), we estimate the critical gradient value, G for which the ratio

The magnetic moments of these ions are very small and are on the same order of
magnitudeasthenuclearmagneton,μ =5.05×10 -27J/T:p =2.22μ (sodium-
n Na+ n

(calcium-40).Amongtheseions,Na+hasthelargestmagneticmomentandCa2+has
zero electronic and nuclear magnetic moments. So, a magnetic gradient field does
notaffect Ca2+contributiontotheMP.Fortheabovelistedionconcentrationsand
magnetic moments, the estimations from Eq. (5.9) give G of the order of (1010–
cr
1011) T/m. However, the currently reachable magnetic gradient values are of the
orderof(106–107)T/m(Dempseyetal.2014).
Thus,itisunlikelythatastaticMFwithcurrentlyreachablevaluesofthegradient
cancauseasignificantchangeoftherestingmembranepotentialofexcitablecells.
Nevertheless, this is possible for cells with low values (V < 10 mV) of the
m
membrane potential: cancer cells, proliferative cells, and undifferentiated mESCs
(see Fig. 5.1). It is paradoxical that highly differentiated tumor cells (human hepa-
tocellular carcinomas: Tong, HepG2, Hep3B, PLC/PRF/5, Mahlavu, and HA22T)
havelow membrane potentials (Binggeli etal.1994).Now weestimatethecritical

in the MP can lead to significant changes of the whole-cell machinery, especially
duringthedevelopmentofanorganism.Thus,forcellshavinglowMPsamagnetic
field with the magnetic gradient of the order of (107–108) T/m (the experimentally
attainable laboratory magnetic gradients) is capable of changing MP by a few
percent. Magnetic systems generating magnetic fields with gradients on the order
of 109 T/m would allow for significant alteration of the membrane potential in
accordance with predictions based on Eq. (5.6). However, the question arises
wheresuchgradientfieldsareachievable.

5.4 Smallest Magnets Generate the Highest Magnetic

An approach to reach the highest magnetic gradient with the smallest magnets is
based on the fact that the magnetic gradient value benefits greatly from scale
reduction (Cugat et al. 2003; Zablotskii et al. 2010, 2013). Therefore, micro- and

nano-magnets can generate high-gradient magnetic fields. For example, in the
vicinity of a magnetic nanostructure, the magnetic field gradient can be large
enough, up to 107 T/m (Dumas-Bouchiat et al. 2010; Zanini et al. 2011, 2012;
Osmanetal.2012,2013;Zablotskiietal.2016b).Onthesurfaceofa8nmdiameter

show how the magnetic nanostructures can be used to control the cell membrane
potentialwithgradientmagneticfields.
5.5 Controlling Membrane Potential with MNPs Bound
with Ion Channels
First, we consider a chain of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) placed on a cell
membrane which can create spatially modulated magnetic flux distributions with a
sufficientgradient(Fig.5.3).FortheshownchainsoffourMNPswithparalleland

Fig. 5.4 Ion channel in the cell membrane experiences the magnetic force from a magnetic
nanoparticle and the externally applied gradient magnetic field. Upon activation of a gradient
magnetic field source, the ion channel is forced close (a). Channel closing and opening by the

The magnetic gradient forces localized near the cell membrane may affect cell
functionsintwomainways:(1)directchangingtherestingmembranepotential,as
predicted in Eq. (5.6) and (2) locally disturbing the channel gating mechanism
resulting in a modulation of the resting and action MPs. The former can occur
locally as a consequence of a very high field gradient, as given in Eq. (5.11). The
secondmechanismismoreeffectivewhenamagneticnanoparticleisdirectlybound
to a membrane channel, especially to mechanosensitive or ligand-gated channels.
Below we consider this mechanism in detail. There are two possible cases: one
magnetic nanoparticle bound to a channel in combination with a source of high-
gradientmagneticfield(Fig.5.4a)andtwointeractingmagneticnanoparticlesbound
toachannel(Fig.5.4b,c).
First, we consider a magnetite (Fe O ) nanoparticle with M = 510 kAm -1 and

R = 5 nm, coupled to a channel domain in the presence of an MF with gradient

alsoparalleltothemembrane(Fig.5.4a).Ifthisforceiscomparablewiththeforces
driving the channel opening/closing, it disturbs the expression of the channel. For
example, upon activation of a gradient magnetic field source, the ion channel is
forced close (Fig. 5.4a). The magnetic moment of the magnetite particle is
p = 4πR 3M/3 ≈ 2.67 × 10 -19 Am2. It is interesting that a superparamagnetic

5 nm magnetite particle experiences the force of the order of 100 pN, which is
sufficienttoclosethechannel(Fig.5.4a).
Second,weconsideracasewhentwomagnetiteorferritinnanoparticlescoupled

Thus, a large magnetic field gradient from one particle acting on the second
particleresultsinthemagneticgradientforceoftheorder100pN.Similarestimates
forthemagnitudeofthemagneticforcebetweentwoferritinparticleswereobtained
inBarbic(2019).
Thus, there is the possibility to control the expression of mechanosensitive
channels with an external MF and MNPs with the magnetic moments of the order
(2–3)×10 -19Am2coupledtothechannelbody(Fig.5.4b,c).Figure5.4illustrates
the concept of magnetically controlled channel expression with (a) one MNP in a
gradientexternalMFand(b)twoMNPsboundtomembranereceptorsinanexternal
homogeneous MF. Considering the second mechanism (two MNPs in an MF) an
intriguing approach to channel gating can be proposed: use a uniform rotating
moderate magnetic field to periodically switch ion channels between open and
closedstates.Indeed,theparticlemomentsaturatesatrelativelylowmagneticfields
(~1 Tesla), and therefore upon changing the field direction, the nanoparticle mag-
neticmomentswillbeorientedeitherparallel(Fig.5.4b)orperpendiculartothecell
membrane (Fig. 5.4c). In the first, the interparticle attraction closes the channel,
whileinthesecond,theinterparticlerepulsionmakesthechannelopen.
Another mechanism of magnetic control of mechanosensitive ion channel with
~1μmmagneticparticlesboundtotheintegrinreceptorsincombinationwithahigh-
gradientmagneticfieldwassuggestedinDobson(2008).Herethemagneticparticles
are pulled toward the field gradient, deforming the cell membrane, and activating
adjacentmechanosensitiveionchannels.

tite nanoparticles allows us to drive the cell membrane potential. The possible

Eq. (5.16), the permeability of the channel may depend on the magnetic field

5.6 Conclusions
Understanding the processes underlying cell responses to high magnetic fields is a
fundamental challenge of ever-increasing interest, not only because it is a central
problem of magnetobiology, but also because it is the goal of many therapeutic
strategiesusingmagneticfields.Inthiscontext,weshowthatmolecularintracellular

To a large extent, a high gradient magnetic field on the cell membrane, in
combination with magnetite (or ferritin) magnetic nanoparticles bound to specific
ion channels could dramatically affect the cellular MPs and thereby change cell

Thepossibilityoftheremotecontrolofthechannelexpressionandcellmembrane

Impact of Static Magnetic Fields on Cells
XinmiaoJiandXinZhang
Abstract As the basic unit of living organisms, the cell is where the macroscopic
phenomenon meets the microscopic mechanisms. The focus of this chapter is on
currentevidenceofSMFsonhumancellsandsomeanimalcells,withaspecialfocus
onthefactorsthatcontributedtotheseeminglyinconsistentexperimentalresultsin
the literature. We summarize cellular effects of static magnetic fields (SMFs),
includingcellorientation,proliferation,microtubuleandcelldivision,actin,viabil-
ity, attachment/adhesion, morphology, migration, membrane, cell cycle, DNA,
reactive oxygen species (ROS), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as well as calcium.
Although it is obvious that for each aspect, the experimental results are highly
variable,therearesomeeffectsthathaveclearphysicalexplanationsandconfirmed
phenomenon. For example, magnetic properties of the cells and their subcellular
structures are determined by their compositions and structures, which will directly
affect their orientation in high SMFs. However, there are still many unanswered
questions.Forexample,theeffectsofSMFsoncellularROShavebeenreportedby
numerous studies, but the effects are highly variable in different magnetic settings
and sample types and there are still not clear physical explanations. Although the
upscalingofthemechanismsfromcellstotissuesandlivingorganismsisstillahuge
challenge,giventheessentialrolesofcellsinvariouslivingorganisms,theyareno
doubt the central hubfor researchers inthis fieldto unravel theunderlyingmecha-
nismandexplorethefutureapplicationofvariousSMFs.

6.1 Introduction
Justliketemperatureandpressure,magneticfieldisanimportantphysicaltoolthat
could impact multiple objects and processes. Although there are numerous reports
about the SMF bioeffects, their results are highly variable. However, as we have
discussedinChaps.1and2,theseeminglyinconsistentobservationsaremostlydue
tothedifferentSMFparameters,suchasdifferenttypesofmagneticfields(staticor
time-varying, pulsed or noise), magnetic fields with various flux densities (weak,
moderate, or strong) or frequencies (extremely low frequency, low frequency, or
radiofrequency),aswellasbiologicalsampletypes,whichcanallleadtodiverseand
sometimesevencompletelyoppositeresults.
In addition, as we have discussed in Chaps. 3–5, cells are filled with various
cellularcontentsandbiomoleculesofdifferentmagneticpropertiesthatwillrespond
totheMFdifferently.Forexample,ithasbeenshownthatthepeptidebondsunited
into organized structures, such as α-helix, which confers proteins diamagnetic
anisotropy (Pauling 1979). Organized polymers, such as microtubules that are
composedofwell-organizedtubulin,arealsodemonstratedtohavestrongdiamag-
netic anisotropy and could be aligned in the presence of magnetic fields (Vassilev
etal.1982;Brasetal.1998,2014).Infact,ithasbeenfoundthateventhedissolved
oxygeninwatercouldbemodulatedbyhighSMFs(UenoandHarada1982;Ueno
etal.1994,1995).TheeffectsofSMFsoncellshavebeenreviewedanddiscussed
previously(Adair2000;DiniandAbbro2005;Miyakoshi2005,2006;Ueno2012;
Albuquerque et al. 2016). Recently, Torbati et al. published a very comprehensive
reviewaboutthecouplingofmechanicaldeformationandelectromagneticfieldsin
biologicalcells(Torbatietal.2022).Inthisreview,besideselectricfield,theyalso
summarizedanddiscussedthemajormechanismsgoverningtheinteractionforMFs
with cellular functions (Fig. 6.1),which proposedthat deformationmediated inter-
action is likely to be one of the primary mechanisms governing the impact of
magnetic fields on cellular function. This provides a very important point of view
thatoncetheMFsarefirsttranslatedintomechanicaldeformationinthecellandcell
membrane,whichinturnmaytriggeranelectricalresponseviamechanismssuchas

multipleaspectsofcellularbehaviors,includingcellproliferation,endocytosis,etc.
Chap. 5 of this book also provided a detailed in-depth analysis for SMF-induced
membrane changes, with special focus on ion channels, membrane potential, and
gradientSMFs.
Hereinthischapter,ourgoalistoprovideanoverviewforthecurrentevidenceof
SMFeffectsoncells,withaspecialfocusonthedifferentialcellulareffectsreported
inpreviousstudies,which seemscontradictory in many aspects.We try toanalyze
the reasons that have caused these inconsistencies. Here we mainly discuss about
human cells and some animal cells, while cells of plants, bacteria, and other
organismswillbediscussedinChap.7.

6.2.1 Cell Orientation
Theorientationchangesofbiomoleculesandcellsareoneofthemostwellstudied
aspectsofSMFbioeffects.Themagneticpropertiesofbiologicalsampleshavebeen
discussed in Chap. 3. It has been proved that when objects with high magnetic
susceptibility anisotropy areexposed tostrongSMFs,theywillchange theirorien-
tations.TherearemultipleexamplesforcellsalignthemselvesinparalleltotheSMF
direction.Amongthem,thebeststudiedexamplewaserythrocytes(redbloodcells,
RBCs).ThefirstreportedRBCorientationchangeinducedbySMFwasin1965by
Murayama, who found that sickled RBCs were oriented perpendicular to a 0.35 T
SMF(Murayama1965).Itisinterestingthatin1993,aworkcarriedoutbyHigashi
etal.showedthatnormalRBCswerealsoalignedbyan8TSMFbuttheorientation
direction was different from what Murayama has observed (Higashi et al. 1993).
TheirresultsshowedthatnormalRBCsorientedwiththeirdiskplanesparalleltothe
fielddirection(Fig.6.2).In1995,theyreportedthatthecellmembranecomponents,
includingthetransmembraneproteinsandlipidbilayers,werethemajorreasonsfor
RBC alignment in 8 T SMF (Higashi et al. 1995). In addition, they found that the
paramagnetism of membrane-bound hemoglobin contributes significantly to this
orientation (Takeuchi et al. 1995; Higashi et al. 1996). These results clearly dem-
onstrate that cells can be oriented by strong SMFs and the effects depend on the
molecular components of the cell. Besides RBCs, more components in the blood
streamhavealsobeenstudied,suchasplatelets(Yamagishietal.1992;Higashietal.
1997) and fibrinogen (Torbet et al. 1981; Yamagishi et al. 1990; Iwasaka et al.
1994).

Moreover, some other cells like osteoblast cells, smooth muscle cells, and
Schwann cells could also be aligned in parallel to the direction of the strong
magnetic fields when they are exposed for a prolonged period. In 2000 and 2002,
Kotanietal.foundthatosteoblastcellswereorientedinparalleltothefielddirection
byan8TSMFandthebone formation wassignificantlystimulated togrowalong
thedirectionofthemagneticfield(Kotanietal.2000,2002).In2001,Umenoetal.
found that smooth muscle cell was aligned along the magnetic field direction after
theywereexposedtoan8TSMFfor3days(Umenoetal.2001).In2003,Iwasaka
et al. found that the 14 T SMF aligned smooth muscle cell assemblies and the cell
colonieswereextendedalongthefielddirection(Iwasakaetal.2003).Eguchietal.
found that Schwann cells were also oriented in parallel to the 8 T SMF after 60 h
exposure (Eguchi et al. 2003). They used linearly polarized light and observed
changesintheintracellularmacromoleculebehaviorin8Tand14TSMFs(Iwasaka
andUeno2003a,b).In2005,theyalsoexaminedtheactincytoskeletoninSchwann
cellsandfoundthatactinfiberswereorientedinthedirectionof8TSMF(Eguchi
andUeno2005).Moreinterestingly,theSchwanncellsdidnotorientinthe8TSMF
when an inhibitor of small GTPase (guanosine triphosphatase) Rho-associated
kinasewas added, which indicated that theSMF-induced Schwanncell orientation
was dependent on Rho-regulated actin fibers (Eguchi and Ueno 2005). In 2007,
Colettietal.foundthat80mTSMF-inducedmyogenicL6cellstoaligninparallel
bundles, an orientation conserved throughout differentiation. They proposed that
SMF-enhancedparallelorientationofmyotubeswasrelevanttotissueengineeringof
ahighlyorganizedtissuesuchasskeletalmuscle(Colettietal.2007).
Inthemeantime,therearealsomultipleexamplesshowingthatcellscouldalign
inperpendiculartothedirectionofthemagneticfields,suchasthebullsperm.The
orientation of bull sperm was examined by a few studies, which actually showed
strongeralignment effectsthanRBCs andplatelets.Thebullspermcellhasahead
that mainly contains diamagnetic cell membrane and DNA. It also has a long tail
with microtubules inside. In 2001, Emura et al. found that the orientation of bull
spermcellscouldbeaffectedbySMFsinanMFstrength-dependentmanner(Emura
et al. 2001). They found that the bull sperm could reach 100% alignment perpen-
dicular to the direction of the MF at just below 1 T (Emura et al. 2001). In 2003,
Emuraetal.showedthatthewholebullspermandthespermheadswereorientated
perpendicularto1.7TSMF while the paramecium cilia were aligned inparallel to
8 T SMF (Emura et al. 2003). It was interesting that the sperm tail is theoretically
predictedtobeinparallelwiththefielddirectionduetothediamagneticanisotropy
ofmicrotubules,whichwillbediscussedlater.Butwhythewholespermisaligned
inperpendiculartothefielddirectionisstillunclear.Itispossiblethatthespermhead
hasastrongerdiamagneticanisotropy,whichdominatesthewholesperm.
Another example of cell orientation in perpendicular to the direction of the
magneticfieldisneuriteoutgrowth.In2008,Kimetal.showedthattheapplication
of0.12TSMFfor3–5dayscouldbeusedtomodulatetheorientationanddirection
of neurite formation in cultured human neuronal SH-SY5Y cells and PC12 cells
(Kim et al. 2008). It isinteresting that they found theneurites perpendicular to the

directionhad“thickenedorbeaded”dystrophicappearance.Moreimportantly,they
notonlyfoundtheneuritestended toorientperpendiculartothedirectionofSMF,
the direction can also be changed after the SMF direction has changed (Kim et al.
2008).
Fromevidencesmentionedabove,itisclearthatSMF-inducedcellorientationis
celltype-dependent.Actually,Ogiue-IkedaandUenocomparedthreedifferentcell
lines,includingthesmoothmuscleA7r5cells,humangliomaGI-1cells,andhuman
kidney HFK293 cells for their orientation changes under 8 T for 60-h exposure.
They found that while the smooth muscle A7r5 cells and the human glioma GI-1
cells aligned along the field direction, the human kidney HEK293 cells were not
aligned(Ogiue-IkedaandUeno2004).Theyproposedthatthiswasprobablydueto
their different cell shapes because both A7r5 and GI-1 cells were spindle shaped
whileHEK293cellswerepolygonalshaped.Inaddition,theorientationofadherent
cells such as osteoblasts, smooth muscle cells, and Schwann cells in strong SMFs
usually took a few days while floating/suspended cells such as RBCs exhibited a
diamagnetic torque rotation in only a few seconds under SMFs of the same flux
density. This also implies that when our human bodies are exposed to externally
appliedSMFs,theorientationoffreecirculatingbloodcellswouldbeaffectedmore
readilycomparedtoothertypesofcells.
Table 6.1 summarizes some reported studies about the orientation of cells in
SMFs (Table 6.1). It is apparent that other than cell types, the SMF-induced cell
orientation change is largelydependent on the MF intensity. The reported that cell
orientationchangeswereallachievedinSMFsofatleast80mT,andactuallymost
ofthemweredoneinultra-strongmagnets,suchasin8TSMF.Therefore,itisnot
surprising when Gioia et al. investigated the effect of chronic exposure to a 2 mT
SMF on in vitro cultured swine granulosa cells (GCs) and did not observe cell
orientation changes (Gioia et al. 2013). In addition, the cell type is an important
factorbecausemostcellsdonothavestrongstructurecharacteristicslikespermcell,
norRBCs.
Besides the orientation change of cells themselves in magnetic fields, cells can
alsobeorientedbymoderateandstrongSMFswhentheyareembeddedincollagen,
a macromolecule that has strong diamagnetic anisotropy (Torbet and Ronziere
1984).In1993,itwasfoundthathumanforeskinfibroblastsembeddedincollagen
gel were oriented by 4.0 and 4.7 T SMFs (Guido and Tranquillo 1993). Human
glioblastoma A172 cells embedded in collagen gels, but not A172 cells alone,
oriented perpendicular to the field direction of 10 T SMF (Hirose et al. 2003).
Therefore, the orientation for cells embedded in collagen is largely due to the
diamagnetic anisotropy of collagen fibers, which orient in perpendicular direction
of SMF. Another example was provided in 2000 by Kotani et al., who found that
osteoblastcellsthemselveswereorientedinparalleltothefielddirectionbyan8T
SMF,butthemixtureofosteoblastcellsandcollagenorientedperpendiculartothe
magnetic fields (Kotani et al. 2000). This is interesting and promising because the
stimulationofboneformationtoanintendeddirectionusingacombinationofstrong
SMF and potent osteogenic agents could possibly lead to a clinically viable treat-
ment of bone fractures and defects. In addition, in 2003, Eguchi et al. found that

Schwanncellsthemselvesorientedinparalleltothe8TSMFafter60-hexposurebut
when they were embedded in collagen, they were aligned in perpendicular to the
field direction (Eguchi et al. 2003). These data all showed that the collagen has a
strongalignmenteffectoncellsembeddedinSMFs.
The shapes ofmost mammalian somatic cells aresymmetric and surrounded by
andattachedtotheirextracellularmatrixandneighboringcells.Therefore,theyare
less likely to have strong alignment effects in SMFs like sperm cells or RBCs in
weaktomoderateSMFs.However,theSMF-inducedorientationeffectscanpoten-
tially affect their cell division and subsequently tissue development. In addition, it
wasverypromisingthatKotanietal.foundthatan8TSMFcouldcauseosteoblasts
toorientinparalleltothemagneticfieldandstimulateboneformationalongthefield

such as bone disorders. In fact, the orientation effects of RBCs might also provide
some insights to help understanding the working mechanism of some magnetic
therapy products. Continued efforts are encouraged to investigate more on blood
cells, muscles, neurons, bones and sperms, as well as their potential medical
applicationsinthefuture.
6.2.2 Cell Proliferation/Growth
Notsurprisingly,theeffectofSMFsoncellproliferationisalsocelltype-dependent.
We summarize some reported studies about the SMF-induced cell proliferation/
growthchanges(Table6.2).
Multipleevidenceshowedthat SMFs could inhibit cell proliferation. Forexam-
ple, Malinin et al. exposed mouse fibroblast L-929 cells and human fetal lung
fibroblast WI-38 cells to 0.5 T SMF for 4–8 h after they were frozen in liquid
nitrogen and found that the subsequent cell growth was significantly inhibited
(Malinin et al. 1976). In 1999, Pacini et al. examined the effects of 0.2 T SMF in
humanbreastcancercellsandfoundthat0.2Tnotonlyreducedcellproliferationbut
alsoenhancedthevitaminDanti-proliferativeeffect(Pacinietal.1999b).In2003,
Pacini et al. examined human skin fibroblasts for their effects in 0.2 T SMF
generatedbyamagneticresonancetomographyandfoundthatthecellproliferation
wasreduced(Pacinietal.2003).In2008,Hsiehetal.foundthat3TSMFinhibited

to the parameters used in this study and may not apply to other situations, field
strengths,formsofcartilageinjury,oranimalspecies(Hsiehetal.2008).In2012,Li
et al. found that the proliferation of human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells
(hUASMCs) was significantly decreased after 5 mT SMF exposure for 48 h com-
pared with the non-treated group (Li et al. 2012). In 2013, Mo et al. showed that
magnetic shielding increased human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell proliferation
(Moetal.2013),whichindicatedthatthegeomagneticfieldmayhaveaninhibitory
effect on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell proliferation. In 2013, Gioia et al. investi-
gated the effect of a 2 mT SMF on GCs and found that the doubling time was
significantlyreduced(p<0.05)inexposedsamplesafter72hofculture(Gioiaetal.
2013). In 2016, Wang et al. exposed adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) to 0.5 T
SMF for 7 days and found that the cell proliferation was inhibited (Wang et al.
2016). We found that 1 T and 9 T SMFs could inhibit the proliferation of human
nasopharyngeal carcinoma CNE-2Z and colon cancer HCT116 cells (Zhang et al.
2015,2016).
There are also some studies showing that SMFs could promote proliferation of
somecelltypes,suchasbonemarrowcells,stemcellsaswellasendotheliacells.For
example,Martinoetal.foundthat60and120μTSMFsincreasedthecellprolifer-
ationofhumanumbilicalveinendothelialcell(Martinoetal.2010).In2013,Chuo
etal.foundthata0.2TSMFincreasedtheproliferationofbonemarrowstemcells
(Chuoetal.2013).In2007,Stolfaetal.usedMTTassaytostudytheeffectof0.6T
SMF on human chondrocytes and found that the MTT reading was increased by
0.6 T SMF (Stolfa et al. 2007), which was probably due to the increased cell
proliferation and/or cell viability or metabolic activity. Maredziak et al. found that
0.5TSMFincreasedtheproliferationrateofhumanadipose-derivedmesenchymal
stromal stem cells (hASCs) via activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt
(PI3K/Akt)signalingpathway(Maredziaketal.2017).Recently,Wuetal.reported
that exposure to SMFs of 140 mT (Max) causes membrane depolarization

However, there are also some studies shown that cell proliferation was not
affectedbySMFs.Forexample,in1992Shortetal.foundthat4.7TSMFtreatment

2007,Colettietal.foundthat80mTSMFdidnotaffectmyotubecellproliferation
(Colettietal.2007).In2010,HsuandChangfoundthat0.29TSMFdidnotaffect
the cell proliferation of dental pulp cells (Hsu and Chang 2010). In 2015, Reddig
etal.foundthatexposureofunstimulatedmononuclearbloodcellsto7TSMFalone

fields did not affect cell proliferation (Reddig et al. 2015). Iachininoto etal. inves-
tigatedtheeffectsof1.5Tand3TgradientSMFsfortheireffectsonhematopoietic
stem cells and found that the cell proliferation was not affected (Iachininoto et al.
2016).
Moreover, there are some studies that have compared different cell types. For
example,in2003Aldinuccietal.testedtheeffectsofcombininga4.75TSMFanda
pulsed electromagnetic field (EMF) of 0.7 mT generated by an NMR apparatus.
Theyfoundthatthe4.75TSMFdidnotaffectcellproliferationinbothnormaland
PHA-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), but significantly
reduced proliferation in Jurkat leukemia cells (Aldinucci et al. 2003b). We found
that 1–9 T SMFs inhibited CNE-2Z and HCT116 cancer cells but not the Chinese
hamsterovary(CHO)cells(Zhangetal.2016).Inaddition,wefoundthattheEGFR/
Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, which was upregulated in many cancers, was
involved in SMF-induced cancer cell proliferation inhibition (Zhang et al. 2015,
2016). In addition, as we have mentioned before, SMF-induced effects on cell
proliferation were not only cell type-dependent, but also dependent on SMF flux
densityaswellascelldensity.Moreinvestigationsareneededtounraveladditional

6.2.3 Microtubule and Cell Division
PurifiedmicrotubuleshavebeenknownforalongtimetobeatargetofSMFsaswell

todiamagneticanisotropyoftubulindimers(Vassilevetal.1982;Brasetal. 1998,
2014; Minoura and Muto 2006; Wang et al. 2008). It was also shown that tubulin
assembly in vitro was disordered by a 10–100 nT hypogeomagnetic field (HGMF;
magnetic fields <200 nT) (Wang et al. 2008). These studies demonstrated that
microtubules could be affected by SMFs in vitro, but the effects of SMFs on
microtubules in cells were less reported. In 2005, Valiron et al. showed that the

microtubuleandactincytoskeletoncouldbeaffectedby7–17Tultra-highSMFsin
somecelltypesduringinterphase(Valironetal.2005).In2013,Gioiaobservedactin
and alpha-tubulin cytoskeleton modifications in swine granulosa cells after 3 days
exposuretoa2mTSMF(Gioia etal.2013).However, thiseffect seemstobecell
type- and/or exposure time-dependent because our group did not observe obvious
microtubule abnormalities in CNE-2Z or RPE1 interphase cells when we exposed
themto1TSMFfor3daysor27Tultra-strongSMFfor4h(Zhangetal.2017b).
Microtubuleisakeycomponentformitoticspindle,whichismainlycomposedof
microtubulesandchromosomesandisthefundamentalmachineryforcelldivision.
However, information about the mitotic spindles in SMFs was not provided in the
above-mentionedstudies.Incontrast,time-varyingmagneticfieldsandelectricfields
havebeenshowntobeabletoaffectmitoticspindleandcelldivision.Forexample,
in 1999, Zhao et al. found that a small physiological electric field could orient
cultured human corneal epithelial cells through affecting cell division (Zhao et al.
1999). In 2011, Schrader et al. observed spindle disturbances in human-hamster
hybrid(A(L))cellsinducedbytheelectricalcomponentofthemobilecommunica-
tion frequency range signal (Schrader et al. 2011). However, for time-varying
magneticfields,peopleneedtodistinguishtheeffectscausedbythemagneticfields
perseorthethermaleffect.In2011,Ballardinetal.foundthat2.45GHzmicrowaves
could disrupt spindle assembly (inducing multipolar spindles) in Chinese hamster
V-79 cells, which was not due to the thermal effects (Ballardin et al. 2011). In
contrast, in 2013, Samsonov and Popov found that exposure to 94 GHz radiation
increasedtherateofmicrotubuleassemblyandthateffectwasactuallycausedbythe
thermal effect (Samsonov and Popov 2013). The thermal effect in Samsonov and
Popov’s study is likely due to the high frequency compared to Ballardin et al.’s
study. Moreover, there is a well-known electromagnetic approach called tumor
treating fields (TTF, TTFields) that use low-intensity (1–3 V/cm) and
intermediate-frequency (100–300 kHz) alternating electric fields to treat cancers
such as glioblastoma. The mechanism has been proved to be mainly through
disturbing mitotic spindle formation (Kirson et al. 2004; Pless and Weinberg
2011; Davies et al. 2013). TTFields destroy cells within the process of mitosis via
apoptosis and have no effect on non-dividing cells (Pless and Weinberg 2011). In
fact,theU.S.FoodandDrugAdministrationhasapprovedthistechnologyforusein
glioblastoma(Davis2013).
WepreviouslyfoundthatmitoticspindlescouldbeaffectedbySMFs(Luoetal.
2016). Our results show that 1 T SMF treatment for 7 days could increase the
abnormal mitotic spindles and mitotic index (% of cells in mitosis) in HeLa cells,
whichislikelyduetotheeffectofSMFonmicrotubules.Inaddition,thisphenotype
isalsotime-dependentbecausewhencellsweretreatedforshortertime,theeffects
were notobvious. Although 1 T SMF did notaffect the overall cell cycledistribu-
tion, it could delay the mitotic exit using synchronization experiment (Luo et al.
2016),whichwillbediscussedinthecellcyclesectionlaterinthischapter.
SincepurifiedmicrotubulescanbealignedbySMFs,wepredictthatthespindle
orientation could also be affected, which is a critical determining factor for cell
division orientation. In fact, back in 1998, Denegre et al. found that 16.7 T large

gradient ultra-high SMF could affect the division orientation of Xenopus eggs
(Fig.6.3)(Denegre etal.1998). In2006, Eguchi etal.showedthat 8 TSMFcould
also change the cleavage plan formation in frog embryo division (Eguchi et al.
2006).ItwasproposedthatSMFsmayaffect theorientationofastralmicrotubules
and/or spindles, which was theoretically proven later by Valles (2002), but no
experimental evidence has been reported. In 2012, Mo et al. found that
hypogeomagnetic field (HGMF; magnetic fields <200 nT) could cause a decrease
in horizontal third cleavage furrows and abnormal morphogenesis in Xenopus
embryos (Mo et al. 2012). In addition, they used immunofluorescence staining of
tubulintoshowthereorientationofthespindleoffour-cellstageblastomeres.Their
resultsindicatedthatabrief(2-h)exposuretoHGMFwassufficienttointerferewith
thedevelopment of Xenopusembryosat cleavage stages.Also,themitotic spindle

Inthemeantime,althoughitwasshownthatthemicrotubuleandactincytoskel-
eton in interphase cells could be affected by 7–17 T ultra-high SMFs in some cell
types(Valironetal.2005),informationaboutthemitoticspindleinultra-highSMFs
was not provided. Using human nasopharyngeal cancer CNE-2Z cells and human
retinalpigmentepithelialRPE1cells,wefoundthatthespindleorientationcouldbe
altered by a 27 T ultra-high SMF. More interestingly, we found that the spindle
orientation was determined by both microtubules and chromosomes (Zhang et al.
2017b)(Fig.6.4).HighSMF-inducedspindleorientationandmorphologychanges

6.2.4 Actin
Besidesmicrotubules,theactincytoskeletonhasalsobeenreportedtobeaffectedby
SMFsinsomecelltypes.Forexample,Moetal.showedthatintheabsenceofthe
geomagneticfield(GMF),theso-calledhypomagneticfield(HMF)environment,the
adhesion and migration of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were inhibited,
whichwereaccompaniedwithareductionincellularF-actinamountanddisordered
kinetics of actin assembly in vitro (Mo et al. 2016). These results indicated that
eliminationoftheGMFaffectedassemblyofthemotility-relatedactincytoskeleton
andsuggestedthatF-actinwasatargetofHMFexposureandprobablyamediatorof
GMFsensation(Moetal.2016).
AlthoughwhetheractincouldserveasamediatorofGMFsensationstillneedsto
befurtherconfirmed,therearemultipleotherstudieshaveshownthatactincouldbe
affected in cells by SMFs. The most striking and convincing data was provided in
2005byEguchiandUeno(2005),whichwasbrieflymentionedinthecellorienta-
tion section above. They examined the actin cytoskeleton in 8 T ultra-high
SMF-treatedSchwanncellsandfoundthatactinfiberswereorientedinthedirection
of the magnetic field. However, when the Schwann cells were treated with an
inhibitor of small GTPase Rho-associated kinase, which disrupted actin fibers, the
orientationphenotypeinducedby8TSMFnolongerexisted.Thisindicatedthatthe
SMF-inducedSchwanncellorientationwasdependentonRho-regulatedactinfibers
(Eguchi and Ueno 2005). Therefore, their data directly showed that the
Rho-regulated actin fibers were involved in SMF-induced cell orientation, at least
inSchwanncell.AnotherexampleforSMF-inducedactinalterationwasin2007by
Colettietal.whousedmyogeniccelllineL6andfoundthat80mTSMFpromoted
myogenic cell alignment and differentiation (Coletti et al. 2007), which was also
introduced in the previous cell orientation section (Table 6.1). More specifically,
they observed increased accumulation of actin and myosin as well as formation of
large multinucleated myotubes, which was derived from increased cell fusion
efficiency, but not cell proliferation (Coletti et al. 2007). In addition, a few other
studiesalsoshowedSMF-inducedactinalterations.Forexample,in2009,Dinietal.
foundthat 72-h of6mT SMF exposurecaused human leukemia U937 cellF-actin
modification (Dini et al. 2009). In 2013, Gioia found actin cytoskeleton modifica-
tions in swine granulosa cells after 3 days exposure to a 2 mT SMF (Gioia et al.
2013).Lewetal.foundthat0.4TSMFcouldincreasethefluorescenceintensityof
theF-actin(Lewetal.2018).
There are also some studies that reported the unchanged actin in SMF-treated
cells. For example, in 2005, Bodega et al. examined primary cultures of astroglial
cells for their responses to 1 mT sinusoidal, static, or combined magnetic field for
various timepoints and did not observe any significant changes on actin (Bodega
et al.2005). In my opinion, theirmagnetic flux density intheir study mightbe too
low to induce actin alteration. We examined multiple human cancer cells, such as
human nasopharyngeal cancer CNE-2Z and colon cancer HCT116 cells, for their
responsesto1TSMFfor2–3daysanddidnotobserveanysignificantchangeson

actin (data not shown). However, the cells we examined are different from above-
mentioned cell types that have actin alterations upon SMF exposure, such as
neuroblastoma cells, Schwann cells, and myogenic cell. These cells may have
different actin regulation network than the cancer cell lines we examined. From
the above-mentioned studies, it is likely that actin cytoskeleton in cells respond to
SMFsinacelltype-andmagneticfieldfluxdensity-dependentway,whichwillneed
moresystematicinvestigations.
6.2.5 Cell Viability
So far, most studies showed that SMFs had minimum effects on cell viability. For
example, in 1992, Short et al. found that 4.7 T SMF treatment did not affect cell
viabilityinbothhumanmalignantmelanomacellsandnormalhumanfibroblastcells
(Shortetal.1992).In2003,Pacinietal.foundthat0.2TSMFcouldaffectthecell
morphology and proliferation but not the cell viability of human skin fibroblasts
(Pacinietal.2003).In2009,Dinietal.reportedthat72-hexposureof6mTSMFdid
not affect cell viability in human leukemia U937 cells (Dini et al. 2009). In 2013,
Gioia et al. investigated the effect of chronic exposure to a 2 mT SMF on in vitro
culturedswinegranulosacells(GCs)andfoundthattheSMFexposuredidnotaffect
the cell viability (Gioia et al. 2013). In 2016, Romeo et al. examined human fetal
lung fibroblasts MRC-5 exposed to 370 mT SMF and found that the cell viability
wasnotaffected(Romeoetal.2016).Weexamined1TSMF-inducedeffectsoncell
viabilityin15differentcelllines,includinghumancancercelllinesCNE-2Z,A431
andA549,non-cancercellline293TaswellasCHOcells,etc.Infact,wechecked
four different cell densities and found that the cell viability was not obviously
changedby1TSMFinanyofthesecelltypes(Zhangetal.2017c).Thesestudies,
includingmorethan20differentcelltypes,showedthatSMFsdonothaveobviously
effectoncellviability.
However,thereareafewstudiesindicatethatSMFscouldincreaseapoptosisin
somecelltypes.In2005,Chionnaetal.reportedthat6mTSMF-inducedapoptosis
inHepG2cellsinatime-dependentmanner.Theapoptosiswasalmostnegligibleat
the beginning of experiment but increased to about 20% after 24-h of continuous
exposure(Chionnaetal.2005).In2006,Tenuzzoetal.foundthat6mTSMFcould
promoteapoptosisinThybridoma3DOcells,humanlivercancerHepG2cells,and
rat thyroid FRTL cells, but not human lymphocytes, mice thymocytes, human
histiocytic lymphoma or human cervical cancer HeLa cells (Tenuzzo et al. 2006).
In 2008, Hsieh et al. found that 3 T SMF-induced human chondrocytes apoptosis
through p53, p21, p27, and Bax protein expression (Hsieh et al. 2008). In 2016,
Wangetal.exposedadipose-derivedstemcells(ASCs)to0.5TSMFfor7daysand
foundthatthecellviabilitywasinhibited(Wangetal.2016).
It is interesting and puzzling that when SMFs are combined with some other
treatments, they have been shown to have totally opposite effects. For example, in
2001,Tofanietal.foundthatwhen3mTSMFwascombinedwith3mT50Hztime-

--- Page 164 ---

150 X.JiandX.Zhang
varying magnetic fields, the apoptosis of human coloncarcinoma WiDr and breast
cancerMCF-7cellswereincreased,whiletheMRC-5cellswerenotaffected(Tofani
etal.2001).In2006,Ghibellietal.foundthatexposuretoSMFsofNMR(1T)could
increase damage-induced apoptosis in tumor cells of hematopoietic origin, but not
mononuclear white blood cells, showing that NMR may increase the differential
cytotoxicity of antitumor drugs on tumor vs. normal cells (Ghibelli et al. 2006).
These studies show that SMF could promote the apoptosis effects of time-varying
magneticfieldsorantitumordrugs.However,therearealsoevidencesshowingthat
SMF could protect some cells from apoptosis. For example, in 1999, Fanelli et al.
showed that 0.3–60 mT SMFs could reduce cell apoptosis induced by damaging
agentssuchasetoposide(VP16)andpuromycin(PMC)(Fanellietal.1999).Itwas
also interesting that although Tenuzzo et al. found that 6 mT SMF could promote
apoptosis in T hybridoma 3DO cells, human liver cancer Hep G2 cells, and rat
thyroid FRTL cells, when the SMF was combined with apoptotic inducing drugs,
suchascycloheximideandpuromycin,ithadaprotectiveeffectbecausethemajority
ofcellscouldberescuedfromapoptosis,exceptfor3DO(Tenuzzoetal.2006).
Therefore, the effect of SMFs on cell apoptosis is magnetic field intensity,
treatment time, and most importantly, cell type-dependent. In most reported cases,
thecellviabilitywasnotaffectedbySMFs.However,therewerealsoafewreports
indicating that some cells could be affected. In addition, SMFs could have combi-
nationalorantagonisticeffectswhentheyarecombinedwithothertreatments,such
as time-varying magnetic fields or different cell damaging agents. Further investi-
gationsarestronglyneededtounraveltheunderlyingmechanisms.
6.2.6 Cell Attachment/Adhesion
There are several studies showing that the cell attachment could be affected by
SMFs.Forexample,in2011,Sullivanetal.exposedthecellsdirectlytoSMFsright
afterseedingwithanexposuretimeof18handfoundthatWI-38(humanfetallung
fibroblastcells)attachmentwassignificantlyreducedby35–120mTSMFs(Sullivan
etal.2011).In2012,Lietal.exposedhumanumbilicalarterysmoothmusclecells
(hUASMCs)to5mTSMFfor48-handfoundthatthecelladhesionwasobviously
decreased (Li et al. 2012). In 2014, Wang et al. found that moderate SMFs of
0.26–0.33 T could reduce human breast cancer MCF-7 cell attachment (Wang
etal.2014).
Althoughtheseresultsindicatethatcellattachment/adhesionmaybeaffectedby
SMFs,theconsensusresultisstilllacking.Inmostcases,SMFsseemtoinhibitthe
cellattachment/adhesion,therearealsooppositeevidences.Forexample,Moetal.
found that shielding of the geomagnetic field also inhibited cell adhesion and
migration accompanied with a reduction in cellular F-actin amount in human
neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (Mo et al. 2016). This indicates that in the absence
of SMF, the cell attachment could also be reduced. Moreover, in our own experi-
ence,thecellattachment/adhesionofmostcellswasnotaffectedbymoderateSMFs.

--- Page 165 ---

6 ImpactofStaticMagneticFieldsonCells 151
Notsurprisingly,theSMF-inducedchangesincellattachmentalsoseemedtobe
cell type-dependent. In 1992, Short et al. tested both human malignant melanoma
cellsandthenormalhumancellsandfoundthatthemalignantmelanomacellshad
reducedattachmenttothetissueculturesurfacewhilethenormalfibroblastswerenot
affectedbythe4.7TSMF(Shortetal.1992).Wangetal.foundthatalthoughhuman
breast cancer MCF-7 cell attachment was reduced by moderate SMFs of
0.26–0.33 T, the HeLa cell attachment was not affected (Wang et al. 2014). In
additiontothedifferentcelltypes,theexperimentalprocedure,suchasthetimingof
SMFexposurebeforeorafterthecellshavebeenattachedtothecellcultureplates,is
alsolikelytobeakeyfactorthatinfluencestheexperimentaloutcomes.Moreover,
we found that the supporting substrate, such as the cell culture plate and the
coverslip,canalsoinfluencetheexperimentalresultsaboutcellattachment/adhesion.
Therefore, more researches are certainly needed to examine the exact effects of
SMFsoncellattachment/adhesion,aswellastheirconsequencesinvivo.
6.2.7 Cell Morphology
Multiple studies have shown that the cell shape can be altered by SMFs. In 2003,
Pacinietal.foundthatthemorphologyofhumanskinfibroblastcellswasmodified
by0.2TSMF(Pacinietal.2003).Inthesameyear,Iwasakaetal.foundthat14T
SMFaffectedthemorphologyofsmoothmusclecellassemblies,andtheshapesof
the cell colonies extended along the direction of the magnetic flux (Iwasaka et al.
2003). Chinonna et al. also reported time-dependent cell shape and membrane
microvillichangesinhumanhistiocyticlymphomaU937cellsandhumanlympho-
cytesbya6mTSMF(Chionnaetal.2003).In2005,Chionnaetal.foundthatHep
G2 cells exposed to 6 mT SMF for 24 h were elongated with many irregular
microvilli randomly distributed on the cell surface, as well as a less flat shape due
to partial detachment from the culture dishes. In addition, cytoskeleton was also
modified in a time-dependent manner (Chionna et al. 2005). In 2009, Dini et al.
foundthat72hof6mTSMFcausedhumanleukemiaU937cellshapechangeand
F-actin modification, appearance of membrane roughness and large blebs and
impaired expression of specific macrophagic markers on the cell surface (Dini
etal.2009).Itwas also interestingthat althoughthecell growthwas inhibited,the
average cell size of rat pituitary adenoma GH3 cells was increased by prolonged
exposureto0.5TSMF(RosenandChastney2009).In2013,Gioiafoundcelllength
andthicknesschanges,aswellasactinandalpha-tubulincytoskeletonmodifications
inswinegranulosacellsafter3daysexposuretoa2mTSMF(Gioiaetal.2013).Mo
etal.foundthatmagneticshieldingmadethehumanneuroblastomaSH-SY5Ycells
smaller in size and more round in shape, which was likely due to the disordered
kineticsofactinassembly(Moetal.2016).
Notsurprisingly,therearealsomanystudiesthatdidnotobservecellmorphology
changesafterSMFexposure.Forexample,in1992,Satoetal.foundthattherewere
nocellshape changesinHeLa cellsafter1.5TSMFexposurefor96h(Satoetal.

1992).In2003,Iwasakaetal.foundthatnodistinctchangesincellmorphologyin
smoothmuscle cellsincluding cell membrane components occurredduringthe3-h
exposure to 8 T magnetic field (Iwasaka and Ueno 2003b). In 2005, Bodega et al.
examinedprimaryculturesofastroglialcellsfortheirresponsesto1mTsinusoidal,
static, or combined magnetic fields for various timepoints and did not observe any
significant changes on actin (Bodega et al. 2005). Again, the cell type may play a
veryimportantroleintheSMF-inducedcellmorphologychanges.Forexample,in
1999, Pacini et al. found that a 0.2 T magnetic field-induced obvious morphology

breastcarcinomacells(Pacinietal.1999a).
In addition, multiple other factors could also determine whether people can
observecellmorphologychangesafterSMFexposure,suchasmagneticfluxdensity
andexposuretime,aswellasdetectiontechniquesandexperimentalsetup.Thereare
twostudiesthatbothusedfreezingandSMFbuttheexperimentalresultsaretotally
different.Thefirstonewasin1976,Malininetal.exposedmousefibroblastL-929

werethawedandculturedfor1–5weeks(Malininetal.1976).Incontrast,in2013,
Lin et al. found that when 0.4 or 0.8 T SMFs were used during the slow cooling
proceduresofRBCs,thesurvivalratesoffrozen-thawedRBCswereincreasedand
there was no morphological changes (Lin et al. 2013). The mechanisms of the
SMF + freezing-induced cell growth and/or morphological changes between these
twostudiesarestillunknown,whichcouldbeduetotheSMF+freezingprocedure
differences, or cell type differences. More studies are needed to test more cells in
bothprocedurestorevealtheunderlyingmechanisms.
6.2.8 Cell Migration
Therearesome studies showingthat SMFscould affect cell migration.Ontheone
hand,studiesshowthatcellmigrationcanbeinhibitedbySMFs.Forexample,back
in1990,Papatheofanisfoundthat0.1TSMFcouldinhibitcellmigrationofhuman
polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) (Papatheofanis 1990). In 2012, Li et al.
found that 5 mT SMF treatment for 48 h inhibited human umbilical artery smooth
musclecells(hUASMCs)migration(Lietal.2012).In2021,ourgroupfoundthatan

protein (C-myc). The ovarian cancer metastasis in mice was also inhibited (Song
etal.2021).
On the other hand, there are also studies indicate that SMFs can increase cell
migration. For example, in 2016, Mo et al. found that in the absence of the
geomagneticfield,thehumanneuroblastomacellmigrationwasinhibitedaccompa-
niedwithareductionincellularF-actinamount(Moetal.2016).Thisindicatesthat
geomagnetic field may be important for cell migration. Recently, by NIH3T3
cellular experiments in vitro and diabetic wound healing experiments in vivo, we

show that high glucose-induced impairments incell migrationcanbe improved by
moderate SMF treatment, which makes them a potential tool to improved diabetic
wound healing (Feng et al. 2022). However, the relevant studies about SMFs and
cellmigrationaretoofewtofindsomecluesaboutthemagneticparameterandcell
types.
It should be mentioned that there are many studies using gradient SMFs to
separate different cell populations based on their different migration ability, which
iscalledmagnetophoresis.Basedonthemeasuredmagneticmomentsofhemoglo-
binandtherelativelyhighhemoglobinconcentrationofhumanRBCs,thedifferen-
tialmigrationofRBCswaspossibleifexposedtoahighgradientSMF.Forexample,
in2003,Zborowskietal.usedameanmagneticfieldof1.40Tandameangradient
of 0.131 T/mm to separate deoxygenated and methemoglobin (metHb)-containing
RBCs(Zborowskietal.2003).Theexistenceofunpairedelectronsinthefourheme
groups of deoxy and metHb gives them paramagnetic properties, which is very
differentfromthediamagneticpropertyofoxyhemoglobin.Zborowskietal.showed
thatthemagnetophoreticmobilityforerythrocyteswith100%deoxygenatedhemo-
globinandforerythrocytescontaining100%metHbweresimilar,whileoxygenated
erythrocytes were diamagnetic (Zborowski et al. 2003). Magnetophoresis could
provide a way to characterize and separate cells based on magnetic properties of
biological macromolecules in cells (Zborowski et al. 2003). In fact, this technique
has been used in both malaria detection and infected erythrocyte separation.
Althoughmanyothertechniquesarealsoavailable,magnetophoreticisveryprom-
ising because of their high specificity for malaria parasite-infected RBCs
(Kasetsirikuletal.2016).
There arealso some studiesusing gradientSMFsto“guide” cell migration. For
example, in 2013, Zablotskii et al. showed that SMF gradient could assist cell
migrationtothoseareaswiththestrongestmagneticfieldgradient,therebyallowing
thebuildupoftunableinterconnectedstemcellnetworks,whichisanelegantroute
fortissueengineeringandregenerativemedicine(Zablotskiietal.2013).
6.2.9 Stem Cell Differentiation
Stem cell is probably one of the most susceptible cell types that are responsive to
MFs. In fact, there have been multiple studies that have investigated the effect of
SMFsonstemcells,suchasdentalpulpstemcells(DPSCs),bonemarrowstromal
cells (BMSCs), human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs), etc., which have been
previouslydiscussedinsomereviews(Sadrietal.2017;Maryczetal.2018;Hoetal.
2019).
In recent few years, there are more studies that have reported the promotion
effects of SMFs on stem cells. For example, it was shown that a 0.4 T SMF can
enhancedentalpulpstemcellproliferationbyactivatingthep38mitogen-activated
proteinkinasepathwayasitsputativemechanism(Lewetal.2018).In2019,using

(WMFs)of<1mTalteredstemcellproliferationandsubsequentdifferentiationvia
changes in ROS accumulation and downstream heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70)
expression, indicating that by adjusting SMF strength, SMFs can increase or
decrease new tissue formation in vivo (Van Huizen et al. 2019). In 2021, Zhang
et al. investigated the effect of moderate SMF on the chondrogenesis and prolifer-
ation of mandibular bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MBMSCs) in the
MBMSC/mandibular condylar chondrocyte (MCC) coculture system. They found
that the proliferation of MBMSCs was significantly enhanced in the experimental
group with MBMSCs cocultured with MCCs under SMF stimulation relative to
controls. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content was increased, and SOX9, collagen
typeIIalpha1(COL2A1),andaggrecan(ACAN)werealsoincreasedatthemRNA
and protein levels. This indicates the potential of moderate SMF in repairing
condylar cartilage defects in medicine (Zhang et al. 2021). Recently, Wu et al.
found that ~100 mT SMF regulates T-type calcium ion channels and mediates
mesenchymal stem cells proliferation (Wu et al. 2022). There are also two studies
that have investigated the SMF effects on cancer cell stemness (Zhao et al. 2021;
Songetal.2022),whichwillbediscussedinChap.9ofthisbook.
6.2.10 Cell Membrane
Thecellmembraneitselfisdielectricandplaysimportantrolesincellularresponses
to external stimuli, especially for electromagnetic fields. As we have mentioned in
theintroduction,SMFcouldaffectcellularfunctionviamembrane,whichhasbeen
reviewed from a physical point of view, focusing on deformation (Torbati et al.
2022), and gradient SMF-induced membrane changes involving ion channels and
membranepotential(Chap.5ofthisbook).
Infact,highSMF-inducedmembranealignmentchangeisoneofthebeststudied
effects on biomolecules. The cell membrane mainly consists of phospholipids and
embeddedproteins,andthephospholipidsofacellmembraneareorderlyarranged
in a double layer, called lipid bilayers. Due to the diamagnetic anisotropy of
phospholipid molecules in the lipid bilayer (Braganza et al. 1984; Helfrich 1973),
the phospholipid molecules would align or reorient in the high SMFs, which
consequently affect the bulk biophysical properties of the cell membrane. In fact,
the RBC orientation changes mentioned earlier are one of the best examples illus-
trating the action of SMF on cell membrane to affect cellular behaviors (Fig. 6.2).
Moreover,inamoresimplifiedmodel,thelipidvesiclesmadefromegglecithinare
showntobeabletocompletelyalignparallellytoanexternal1.5TSMFinseconds
(Fig.6.6)(BoroskeandHelfrich1978).Thesestudiesdemonstratethattheoriginof
magnetic alignment of nonspherical vesicles is the interaction of the magnetically
anisotropicbilayerwiththeexternallyappliedSMFs.
Later, multiple studies have shown that the cell membrane permeability can be
increasedbySMFs.Forexample,in2011,Liuetal.usedAtomicForceMicroscope

the cell membrane of K562 cells, which may increase the membrane permeability
andtheflowoftheanticancerdrugs(Liuetal.2011).In2012,Bajpaietal.foundthat
0.1 T SMF could suppress both gram positive (S. epidermidis) and gram negative
bacteria (E. coli) growth, which was likely due to SMF-induced cell membrane
damages (Bajpai et al. 2012). There are also multiple studies indicated that SMFs

couldincreasethemembranerigidityincells.Forexample,in2013,Linetal.found
thata0.8TSMFdecreasedmembranefluidityandenhancederythrocytemembrane

2013).TheyfoundthattheSMFcoupledwiththeslowcoolingprocedureincreased

ThereforetheyproposedthattheSMFsincreasedthebiophysicalstabilityofthecell
membrane,whichreduceddehydrationdamagetotheerythrocytemembraneduring
theslowcoolingprocedure(Linetal.2013).In2015,Hsiehetal.showedthatdental
pulp cells (DPCs) treated with a 0.4 T SMF had a higher tolerance to lipopolysac-
charide(LPS)-inducedinflammatoryresponsewhencomparedtountreatedcontrols.
They suggested that 0.4 T SMF attenuates LPS-induced inflammatory response to
DPCs by changing cell membrane stability/rigidity (Hsieh et al. 2015). Lew et al.
used0.4TSMFtotreatdentalpulpstemcells(DPSCs)andsuggestedthatthecell
membranesoftheDPSCswereaffectedtoinfluenceintracellularcalcium(Lewetal.
2018).
The effects of SMFs on cell membrane are also cell type-dependent. In 2006,
Nuccitellietal.showedthat6mTSMFexposurefor5minaffectedcellmembrane
potential differently in various cell types. Specifically, the 6 mT SMF caused
depolarization in Jurkat cells but hyperpolarization in U937 cells (Nuccitelli et al.
2006).Inaddition,highresolutionimagingtechniqueslikeAFMorelectronmicros-
copy are also important to reveal the SMF-induced cell membrane changes, which
have been used in multiple studies to reveal the membrane changes or membrane
associatedproteinchangescausedbySMFs(Jiaetal.2007;Liuetal.2011;Wang
etal.2014).Incontrast,lowresolutionimagingtechniquesarelesslikelytounravel
the membrane changes. In 2010, Wang et al. used an illustration to show the
potential mechanism of SMFs on cell membrane, some of the associated receptor
and channel proteins, as well as the downstream effectors (Wang et al. 2010). In
addition, since membrane dynamics changes can affect the activity of membrane
embedded proteins, SMFs may also affect some of the membrane associated pro-
teins,suchasmechanosensitiveionchannelsorotherembeddedproteins(Petrovand
Martinac2007;Wangetal.2010).
Since SMF-induced membrane bending not only affects ion channels, but also
leadstothegenerationofelectricalfieldsviaflexoelectricity,theeffectsofSMFson
cell membrane could potentiallyaffect a large numberof cellular processes, which
are still underexplored. It is possible that some of the SMF-induced effects on
nervous system (Chap. 13), ROS and calcium changes that will be discussed later
in this chapter, are all related to the SMF-induced membrane deformation, which
shouldbeinvestigatedinmoredetailsinthefuture.
6.2.11 Cell Cycle
ThereareafewstudiesindicatingthatSMFsmaybeabletoaffectcellcycleinsome

1 TSMF could cause a mitotic arrestto reduce cell number insynchronized HeLa

Ontheotherhand,mostotherstudiesfoundthatthecellcyclewasnotaffectedby

etal.investigatedtheeffectsofa15mTSMFoncellcycleprogressioninratbone
marrowstemcells(BMSCs)anddidnotfindanycellcyclechanges(Sarvestanietal.
2010). We analyzed multiple cell types seeded at different cell densities for the
effects of 1 T SMF (Zhang et al. 2017c). For all the cell lines we tested, 1 T SMF
exposurefor2daysdidnotsignificantlyaffectthecellcycle.Inaddition,weexposed

to9TSMFfor3days(Zhangetal.2016),orexposedCNE-2Zcellstoanultra-high
27 T SMF for 4 h and did not observe obvious cell cycle changes (Zhang et al.
2017b).
However,theeffectofSMFsoncellcycleislikelytobecelltype-dependent,just
like most other SMF-induced cellular effects. In 2010, Zhao et al. found that 13 T
SMFhadnoobviouseffectonthecellcycledistributioninbothCHOcellsandDNA
double-strand break repair-deficient mutant XRS-5 cells, but decreased the G0/G1
phase and increased S phase cell percentage in human primary skin AG1522 cells
(Zhaoetal.2010).ThisindicatesthatmaybeSMFshavemoreeffectsoncellcycles

inSMF-inducedaredifferentinreportedstudies(Chenetal.2010;Zhaoetal.2010).
Therefore, further investigations are needed to examine more cell types and/or
experimentalconditionsfortheexacteffectofSMFsoncellcycle.
Although most results so far showed that SMFs did not change the overall cell
cycle distribution of a given cell population, we found that prolonged exposure
(7days)to1TSMFcouldincreasetheabnormalspindlepercentageandthemitotic
index in HeLa cells (Luo et al. 2016). Moreover, we found that the duration of
mitosiswasincreasedby1TSMF.Usingcellsynchronizationexperiment,wefound
that1TSMFcoulddelaycellsexitingfrommitosis.Intheabsenceof1TSMF,most

6.2.12 DNA
Duetothepublichealthconcernsaboutthepowerlines,mobilephones,andcancer,
DNA integrity is frequently studied in pulsed MFs (McCann et al. 1993; Cridland
etal.1996;Olssonetal.2001;Zhouetal.2002;Williamsetal.2006;Ruiz-Gomez
etal.2010).Asearlyas1984,Liboffetal.showthatDNAsynthesisincellscouldbe

Incontrast,SMF-inducedDNAdamageandmutationarerelativelylessrevealed.
In 2004, Takashima et al. used somatic mutation and recombination test system in
DNA repair-proficient and -deficient strains of Drosophila melanogaster to test
strongSMFsfortheirpossibleeffectsonDNAdamageandmutationinflies.They
found that 2, 5, or 14 T fields exposure for 24 h caused a statistically significant
enhancement in somatic recombination frequency in the postreplication repair-
deficientflies,whereasthefrequencyremainedunchangedinthenucleotideexcision
repair-deficient flies and in the DNA repair-proficient flies after exposure. In addi-
tion,theyfoundthatexposuretohighmagneticfieldsinducessomaticrecombination
inDrosophilaandthatthedose-responserelationshipisnotlinear(Takashimaetal.
2004). Other than this work in flies, most other studies revealed that SMFs do not
cause DNA damage or mutation. For example, in 2015, Reddig et al. found that
exposure of unstimulated human mononuclear blood cells to 7 T SMF alone or
combinedwithvaryinggradientmagneticfieldsandpulsedradiofrequencyfieldsdid
not induce DNA double-strand breaks (Reddig et al. 2015). In 2016, Romeo et al.
examinedhumanfetallungfibroblastsMRC-5exposedto370mTSMFandfound
that the DNA integrity was not affected (Romeo et al. 2016). Wang et al. exposed
adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) to 0.5 T SMF for 7 days and did not observe
DNA integrity changes (Wang et al. 2016). Therefore, these studies did not reveal
the direct DNA damage. Interestingly, in 2014, Teodori et al. found that the DNA
damage in primary glioblastoma cells caused by X-ray irradiation could be
prevented by an 80 mT SMF exposure, which is likely due to the SMF-induced
protection effect on mitochondria membrane potential (Teodori et al. 2014). So
80mTSMFmighthaveaprotectiveroleinX-ray-inducedDNAdamage.However,
it was also shown that combining10 TSMF with X-ray-irradiation could promote
themicronucleusformation,althoughthe10TSMFitselfdoesnothaveanyeffects
on micronucleus formation (Nakahara et al. 2002). The available evidences so far
about SMF-induced DNA damage and mutation are still not sufficient to a solid
conclusion.MoststudiesrevealedthatSMFsdonotcauseDNAdamageormutation
inhuman cells.However, more investigations areencouraged to examine different
cell types and magnetic field intensities to help us to achieve a more complete
understandingonthisissue.
Besides DNA damage that we discussed above, the alignment of DNA in the
presenceofmagneticfieldwasalsostudied.ItwasreportedthattheDNAchaincan
be aligned by strong SMFs because of its relative large diamagnetic anisotropy
(Maretetal.1975),whichismainlyduetotheirstackedaromaticbases.Inaddition,
it has been theoretically predicted that the highly compacted mitotic chromosome
armscangenerateelectromagneticfieldsalongthechromosomearmdirection(Zhao
and Zhan 2012) and chromosomes should be able to be fully aligned by SMFs of
around 1.4 T (Maret 1990). In addition, Andrews et al. showed that the isolated
mitoticchromosomescanbealignedbyanelectricfield(Andrewsetal.1980).We

found that a 27 T ultra-high SMF could affect the mitotic spindle orientation in
humancells,inwhichchromosomesplayedimportantroles(Zhangetal.2017b).
Moreover,thenatureofintertwineddouble-strandDNAdeterminesthattheDNA
hastorotateincells(Keszthelyietal.2016).SinceDNAisnegativelychargedand
undergoes fast rotation during replication in living cells, we predict that its move-
ment will be affected by Lorentz force, especially in high SMFs. Combined theo-
retical calculation and cellular experiments, we show that moderate to high SMFs
can directly inhibit DNA synthesis/replication (Yang et al. 2020). We used two
colon cancer and two lung cancer cell lines to detect the SMF effect on DNA
synthesis, which was determined by BrdU incorporation. We observed that the
DNAreplicationwasdecreasedbyabout5–15%byupwarddirectionSMFinfour
different cell lines, while downward direction SMF did not generate such effect
(Fig.6.7).ThedifferentialeffectsofSMFsofdifferentdirectionsonDNAsynthesis

6.2.13 Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)
Reactiveoxygenspecies(ROS)arehighlyactiveradicals,ions,andmoleculesthat
have a single unpaired electron in their outer shell of electrons. ROS include free
oxygenradicals((cid:1)O - ,(cid:1)OH,NO(cid:1),etc.)andnon-radicalROS(H O ,N O ,ROOH,

ROSlevelchangeafterSMFtreatmentisprobablythemostfrequentlyreported
phenomenon in the field of magnetobiology. We have previously reviewed the
literature about ROS changes by various magnetic fields in 2017 (Wang and
Zhang 2017). However, in the past few years, there are a large number of new
studies that have reported the effects of SMFs on ROS levels. We categorize the
reportedstudiesaccordingtotheireffects,includingROSlevelelevation(Tables6.3
and6.6),reduction(Table6.4),ornochange(Tables6.5).
However, there is no rules we can find in these studies yet. For example, for
hypomagnetic fields, some studies showed ROS elevation (Fu et al. 2016), some
showed reduction (Politanski et al. 2013), and some showed no difference
(Politanski et al. 2013; Van Huizen et al. 2019). These variations could be due to
the cell type, magnetic flux density, or even timepoint differences. For example,
Sullivan et al. showed that the oxidant production increased 37% in WI-38 cells
exposedtoSMF(230–250mT)duringthefirst18hafterseeding,butnochangewas
observed after a prolonged 5-day exposure (Sullivan et al. 2011), which indicates
thattheSMF-inducedROSelevationistime-dependent.Moreover,ROSwasknown

2004; Wang and Zhang 2019). Furthermore, we recently found that gradient mod-
erate SMFs can regulate the oxidative stress and inhibit metastasis in the ovarian
cancercells(Songetal.2021).

inthepresenceof25Mg2+.However,laterstudiesbyCrottyetal.failedtoreproduce
their results (Crotty et al. 2012) and the reason was still unclear (Hore 2012).
Although the magnetic flux densities in these two studies were almost identical,
theexperimentaldetailsaboutthemagneticfieldsetupwereprovidedbyCrottyetal.
but not by Buchachenko and Kuznetsov. In addition, it is also possible that the
difference was due to the fact that these two groups have used different sources of
proteins. Buchachenko and Kuznetsov used a monomeric creatine kinase isozyme
fromsnakevenom,whereasCrottyetal.useddimericcreatinekinase.Toourpoint
ofview,theabove-mentionedfactorsaboutboththemagneticfieldsandtheprotein
itself could potentially produce seemingly inconsistent results. Therefore, more
investigationsareencouragedtoaddressthisquestion.
Besidestheinvitrocatalyticstudies,therearealsosomecellularworksshowing
that the ATP level in cells could be affected by SMFs. However, the exact effects
also seem to be case dependent. Back in 1995, Itegin et al. found that chronically
applied SMF of 0.02 T had differential effects on various ATPase. The mean
activities of Na+–K+ ATPase and Ca2+ ATPase were significantly increased by
SMF but that of Mg2+ ATPase was non-significantly reduced (Itegin et al. 1995).
It is possible that different cells have different ATPase network so that their
responsestoSMFscould bedissimilar.In2010,Wangetal.testedmoderateSMF
(~0.25 T) on PC12 cells (derived from a pheochromocytoma of the rat adrenal
medulla)andfoundthattheATPlevelwasmoderately,butstatisticallysignificantly
increased (Wang et al. 2010). There was another study by Kurzeja et al. that also
reportedATPlevelincreaseinducedbySMF,althoughitwasdoneinthepresence
offluoride.In2013,Kurzejaetal.foundthatmoderateSMFs(0.4,0.6,and0.7T)
couldrescuefluoride-inducedATPdecreaseinfibroblasts.Inaddition,theeffectwas
magnetic flux density-dependent, in which 0.7 T SMF produced more significant
effectsthan0.4and0.6TSMFs(Kurzejaetal.2013).
There were also some studies showing that the cellular ATP level could be
reduced bySMFs ina magnetic fluxdensity- and cell type-dependent manner. For
example,in2011,Zhaoetal.used8.5TstronghomogeneousSMFtotestitseffects
in three cell lines, including human-hamster hybrid A(L) cells, mitochondria-
deficient [ρ(0) A(L)] cells, and double-strand break (DSB) repair-deficient
(XRS-5) cells. They found that SMF-induced ATP content change was magnetic
fluxdensity,time,aswellascelltype-dependent(Zhaoetal.2011).Moreover,their
results indicated that the 8.5 T SMF-induced cellular ATP decrease was partially
mediatedbymitochondriaandtheDNADSBrepairprocessbecausetheATPlevel
in wild type A(L) cells could recover 12–24 h after SMF exposure but the
mitochondria-deficient or double-strand break repair-deficient (XRS-5) cells could
not (Zhao et al. 2011). In 2018, our group used rat adrenal PC12 cells to compare
SMFs of different flux densities for their effects on ATP. Our results show that
although0.26or0.50TSMFsdidnotaffectATP,1Tand9TSMFsaffectedATP
level differently and time-dependently. Moreover, SMF-induced ATP level fluctu-
ations are correlated with mitochondrial membrane potential changes (Wang et al.
2018).

6.2.15 Calcium
Calciumplaysimportantrolesinanumberofbiologicalsystems,especiallyinsignal
transduction cascades. The magnetic field-induced calcium changes in cells are
mostly studied in time-varying magnetic fields (Walleczek and Budinger 1992;
Barbier et al. 1996; Tonini et al. 2001; Zhou et al. 2002; Fassina et al. 2006; Yan
etal.2010)andwasfoundtobedependentoncellstatusandmagneticfluxdensity
(WalleczekandBudinger1992)aswellasothermagneticfieldparameters(Carson
etal.1990).Therearemultiplestudiesshowingthatthecalciumlevelwasincreased
by50–60Hzmagneticfields(Barbieretal.1996;Toninietal.2001;Fassinaetal.
2006).
Similartotime-varyingmagneticfields,therearealsomanystudiesshowthatthe
calciumlevelwasincreasedbySMFs.Forexample,in1998,Flipoetal.examined
theinvitroeffectsof0.025–0.15TSMFsonthecellularimmuneparametersofthe
C57BL/6 murine macrophages, spleen lymphocytes, and thymic cells (Flipo et al.
1998).ExposuretotheSMFfor24hresultedinincreasedintracellularCa2+levelin
macrophages andincreasedCa2+influx inconcanavalin A-stimulated lymphocytes
(Flipoetal.1998).In2006,Tenuzzoetal.showedthat6mTSMFcouldincreasethe
calciumlevelinmultiplecelllines(Tenuzzoetal.2006).Prina-Melloetal.exposed
ratcorticalneuronstoSMFof0.75Tfor1handobservedincreasedcalciumlevel
(Prina-Mello et al. 2006). In 2009, Dini et al. found that 6 mT SMF could cause
significantincreaseincalciumlevelinhumanleukemiaU937cells(Dinietal.2009).
In 2010, Wang et al. found that 0.23–0.28 T SMF could increase extracellular
calcium level in rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC12 cells (Wang et al. 2010). In
addition, they found that SMFs could antagonize CGS21680-induced calcium
reduction, which was similar to the effect of a selective A(2A)R antagonist
ZM241385 (Wang et al. 2010). In the same year, Hsu and Chang also found that
0.29TSMFincombinationwithDex/β-GPsignificantlyincreasedtheextracellular
calciumconcentrationattheearlystage,followedbyobviouscalciumdepositslater,
which may contribute to the accelerated osteogenic differentiation and mineraliza-
tionofdentalpulpcells(DPCs)(HsuandChang2010).In2014,Surmaetal.found
thatweakSMFsincreasedtheintracellularcalciumandacceleratedthedevelopment
of skeletal muscle cells from newborn Wistar rats in primary culture (Surma et al.
2014). In the same year, Bernabo et al. showed that a 2 mT SMF could cause a
reversible cell membrane depolarization wave (of about 1 min), which induced
intracellularcalciumincreaseandmitochondrialactivitydecreaseinvitalgranulosa
cells(Bernaboetal.2014).
In the meantime, there are also some studies showing that the intracellular
calciumwasnotaffectedbySMFs.Forexample,in1986,Bellossiexposedneonatal
isolated chick brains to SMFs of 0.2–0.9 T and did not observe calcium efflux
changes(Bellossi1986).Papatheofanisetal.exposedmiceto1TSMFfor30min/
day for 10 days and did not observe calcium alteration (Papatheofanis and
Papatheofanis 1989). In 1990, Calson et al. found that 0.15 T SMF did not affect
the cytosolic calcium level in HL-60 cells (Carson et al. 1990). In 1992, Yost and

Liburdy combined extremely low frequency (ELF) time-varying magnetic fields
with SMFs and examined their effects on calcium signaling in the lymphocyte
(Yost and Liburdy 1992). Their results showed that a 1 h exposure of thymic
lymphocytes toa16 Hz, 42.1 μTmagnetic fieldcombinedwithacolinearSMF of

Sofarasweknow,thereareonlyafewstudiesthathavereportedtheinhibition

16 Hz, 42.1 μT time-varying magnetic fields with 23.4 μT SMF could decrease

found that a 120 mT SMF caused a minor reduction in the peak calcium current

1996).In2012,Lietal.foundthat5mTSMFcoulddecreasecytosolicfreecalcium
concentrationinhumanvascularsmoothmusclecells(VSMCs)(Lietal.2012).
There are also many indirect evidences showing that calcium is involved in
SMF-inducedcellulareffects.Forexample,in1990,astudyusinghumanpolymor-
phonuclearleukocytes(PMNs)showedthat0.1TSMFcouldinducedegranulation
andcellmigrationinhibition,whichcouldbepreventedbypretreatmentofcalcium
channelantagonistsdiltiazem,nifedipine,andverapamilindose-dependentmanner
(Papatheofanis 1990). In 2005, Okano and Ohkuno found that neck exposure to
180mT(B(max))SMFalonefor5–8weekssignificantlysuppressedorretardedthe
developmentofhypertensiontogetherwithincreasedbaroreflexsensitivity(BRS)in
SMFgroup.TheirresultsindicatedthatSMFmayincreasetheL-typevoltage-gated
calcium channel blocker nicardipine-induced hypotension by more effectively
antagonizing the Ca2+ influx through the calcium channels compared with the
nicardipine injection (NIC) treatment alone (Okano and Ohkubo 2005). In 2006,
Ghibellietal.foundthat1TSMFcouldpotentiatethecytotoxiceffectsofpuromy-
cin and VP16, which could be prevented by calcium chelating agents EGTA and
BAPTA-AMaswellasthecalciumchannelblockernifedipine(Ghibellietal.2006).
In 2008, Yeh et al. found that 8 mT SMF increased the efficacy of synaptic-
transmission in crayfish tail-flip escape circuit in a calcium-dependent way (Yeh
et al. 2008). Also in 2008, Morris et al. used pharmacological agents for L-type
calciumchanneltoshowthatSMF-inducedanti-edemaeffectmayworkthroughthe
L-typecalciumchannelsinvascularsmoothmusclecells(MorrisandSkalak2008).
The differential effects of SMF-induced calcium changes are likely due to
multiple reasons, such as cell types, magnetic flux density as well as incubation
time.Therearemultiplestudiesindicatingthatdifferentcelltypeshavedifferential
calcium changes when exposed to SMFs. In 1999, Fanelli et al. found that the
calcium level in different cell types responded to 6 mT SMF differently, which
seemed to be correlated to the SMF-induced anti-apoptotic effect (Fanelli et al.

--- Page 186 ---

1999).Theyfurtherfoundthatboththeprotectiveandpotentiatingeffectsof6mT
and 1 T SMFs in drug-treated cells were mediated by the Ca2+ influx from the
extracellularmedium,whichonlyhappenedinsomecelltypes(Fanellietal.1999;
Ghibelli et al. 2006). In 2003, Aldinucci et al. tested the effects of combining a
4.75TSMFandapulsedEMFof0.7mTgeneratedbyanNMRapparatusfor1h.
TheyfoundthatinJurkatleukemiacellsthecalciumlevelwasreducedsignificantly
after exposure (Aldinucci et al. 2003b) but in normal or in phytohemagglutinin
(PHA) challenged lymphocytes the calcium level was increased (Aldinucci et al.
2003a). In addition, the SMF-induced calcium changes are also magnetic flux
density-dependent. In 2006, Ghibelli et al. proposed that both the anti-apoptotic
effect of a 6 mT SMF and the potentiating effect of a 1 T SMF were mediated by
calcium influx (Ghibelli et al. 2006). In 2014, Zhang et al. examined multiple
mineral elements for MC3T3-E1 cells during osteoblast mineralization when they
were exposed to 500 nT, control geomagnetic field, 0.2 T, and 16 T SMFs. They
foundthatthecalciumlevelwasdecreasedby500nTand0.2TSMFsbutincreased
bythe16TSMF(Zhangetal.2014).Thismagneticfluxdensity-induceddifference
mayhavecontributedtosomeoftheinconsistenciesintheliterature,inadditionto
the cell type-induced variations. Moreover, the SMF-induced calcium changes are
also likely to be time-dependent. In 2005, Chionna et al. found that Hep G2 cells
exposedto6mTSMFhadincreasedcalciumlevelinatime-dependentmannerandit
reached the highest level at 4 h (Chionna et al. 2005). Table 6.7 summarizes the
calciumchangesinducedbySMFsintheliterature(Table6.7).
Sincecalciumplayscrucialrolesincellularprocessessuchascellproliferationas
well as apoptosis, it is not surprising that different magnetic flux densities could
causedifferentialeffectsoncalciumlevelsinvariouscelltypes,whichleadtototally
diversecellulareffects.Inaddition,therearealsoseveralstudiesthatreportedsome
signaltransductionpathwaychanges,whichareprobablydueto,oratleastpartially
dueto,theSMF-inducedcalciummodulation.Forexample,in2012,Lietal.found
that5mTSMFcouldinfluencetheproliferation,migration,andadhesionofhuman
umbilical artery smooth muscle cells (hUASMCs) by inhibiting the clustering of
integrin β1, decreasing cytosolic free calcium concentration, and inactivating FAK
(Li et al. 2012). We previously found that 1 T SMF could inhibit human CNE-2Z
cancer cell proliferation, which was related to the EGFR-Akt-mTOR pathways
(Zhang et al. 2015, 2016). As mentioned earlier in this chapter, we found that
EGFR and its downstream pathways likely contribute to the cell type- and cell
plating density-induced variations in SMF-induced cell proliferation changes
(Zhang et al. 2017c). In fact, the kinase activity of EGFR protein itself could be
directly inhibited by SMFs (Zhang et al. 2016), which will be further discussed in
Chap.9.Lewetal.used0.4TSMFtotreatdentalpulpstemcellsandfoundthatthe

6.3 Conclusion
Since the human body is composed of various cells, which are filled with various
componentsthatcanrespondtothemagneticfields,moststudiesinthebioeffectsof
magneticfieldsarecarriedoutatcellularlevel.Theparametersofthemagneticfields
as well as the cells examined both have enormous impact on the experimental
outcomes.Sofar,mostcellulareffectsofSMFsarelargelydependentonmagnetic
fieldtypes,fluxdensity,celltypes,aswellasotherfactorsmentionedinChap.1.The
cellular effects not only include the above-mentioned aspects such as cell orienta-
tion, proliferation, calcium level changes, but also some other aspects that are
relatively less studied and not included in this chapter, such as gene expression,
mitochondria, and immune system. It is obvious that further investigations are
needed to get a more complete understanding of the cellular effects of SMFs.
Overall, most cellular effects of SMFs are relative mild, except for the orientation
changes in strong SMFs. In our own lab, to get unbiased and reproducible results
throughoutourstudies,wealwayshaveatleasttworesearcherstoconductthesame
sets of experiments independently and gathered their results together for data
analysis. More importantly, people should know that the cellular effects of SMFs
areinfluencedbyvariousfactorsandparametersofmagneticfieldandthecells,as
well as the experimental procedure, such as incubation time and magnetic field
direction. In addition, the absence of magnetic field effects in some experiments
contrastedwiththepositivefindingsreportedbyotherinvestigators.Thesediscrep-
ancies may be attributable to an inadequate detection capacity of instrument or
techniques. Therefore, people should not only carefully record and analyze all
experimental factors, but also try to take advantages of the advanced modern
technologies to get a more comprehensive understanding of the cellular effects
ofSMFs.

Impact of SMFs on Microorganisms, Plants,
and Animals
BaolinYang,LeiCheng,ZichengLiu,YananZhao,andAnXu
Abstract Staticmagneticfield(SMF)existsinnaturewidelyandplaysanessential
role in the biological evolution. Due to the rapid development of superconducting
technology, the intensities of SMFs used for medical and academic research pur-
poseshavesteadilyincreasedinrecentyears.Thischapterpresentsanoverviewon
thebiologicaleffectsinducedbySMFswithintensitiesrangingfrommTtoseveral
Teslas (T). The effects of SMFs on microorganisms are divided into six sections,
including cellular growth and viability, morphological and biochemical modifica-
tions, genotoxicity, gene and protein expression, magnetosome formation sensing
magneticfield,andapplicationofSMFsonantibioticresistance,fermentation, and
wastewater treatment. The effects of SMFs on plants are divided into six sections,
including germination, growth, gravitropism, photosynthesis, redox status, and
cryptochromes (CRYs) sensing magnetic field. The effects of SMFs on animals
are divided into seven sections, including Caenorhabditis elegans, insects, Helix
pomatia, aquatic animals, Xenopus laevis, mice and rats, and magnetic sensing
protein in animals. This chapter will be very helpful for better understanding the
biologicalresponsestoSMFsindifferentspeciesandtheirunderlyingmechanisms.

7.1 Introduction
Static magnetic field (SMF) is a ubiquitous environmental factor for all living
organismsduringtheevolutionprocess.Avarietyoforganismsincludingbacteria,
algae, snails, planaria, honeybee, salmon, lobsters, salamanders, homing pigeons,
robins, mice, and possibly humans have been demonstrated the ability to sense
magnetic fields (MFs) for orientation in navigation, migration, homing, escaping,
and nest building (Qin et al. 2016). Although the biophysical mechanisms of
magnetoreceptionarepoorlyunderstood,threemainhypothesisformagnetosensing
have been proposed: (1) magnetic induction, which can only be applied to marine
creatures,owingtothehighconductivityofsaltwater;(2)themagnetitehypothesis
that proposes a process mediated by crystals of permanently magnetic material
(magnetite) with an evolutionary genetics hypothesis for magnetite formation;
(3)theradicalpairmechanism(RPM)whichreliesonachemicalreactioninvolving

recently proposed MagR/Cry-based biocompass model combines the concepts of
ferrimagnetism and the involvement of Cry in magnetoreception, which have also

SMFs, which are often ten and more times greater than geomagnetic fields, have
been investigated for decades. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the
influence of SMFs on living systems are still largely unknown, and until now

7.2 SMFs on Microorganisms
7.2.1 SMFs on Cellular Growth and Viability
Theinfluenceofmagnetic fields withvariousfluxdensitiesonthegrowthrate and
viability of microbes has been investigated in bacteria, yeast, and plant pathogenic
fungi. Under low and moderate magnetic fields, the inhibition on the growth of
microorganisms has been reported in various bacteria species. Bajpai et al. (2012)
showed that a SMF of 100 mT suppressed the growth of both gram-positive
(S. epidermidis) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, E. coli), which was

related to the cellular membrane damage. Fan et al. (2018) discussed the effect of
long-term exposure to a moderate SMF on Enterococcus faecalis and showed that
the cellular proliferation of Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) was inhibited by a
SMFof170mTwith120hexposure.ThemoderateSMFsintherangefrom50to
500mTonthegrowthofStreptococcuspyogenes(S.pyogenes)wasinvestigatedby
Morrowetal.(2007)andwasfoundthatthegrowthinhibition wasobservedupto
300 mT, but an increase in growth rate when cells were exposed to 500 mT.
Although a SMF of 300 mT had no influence on the growth of E. coli in nutrient
richLuriaBertani(LB)medium,itincreasedbacterialcellculturedensityduringlate
growth in diluted LB (Potenza et al.2004). El May et al. (2009) also reported that
a SMF of200 mT failed toalter cellular growth butinduceda decrease ofcolony-
formingunits(CFU)between3and6hfollowedbyanincreasefrom6to9h.Ben
Mouhoub et al. (2018) showed that 57 mT SMF improved the viability of Salmo-
nellaHadarcomparedwiththecontrolgroup.Underhighmagneticfields,Kazuhiro
et al. (1997) reported that the cellular growth of Bacillus subtilis MI113 and
genetically transformed B. subtilis MI113 (pC112) was significantly increased by
exposure to homogeneous 7 T and inhomogeneous 5.2–6.1 T magnetic fields.
Moreover,aSMFof5.2–6.1TpromotedsurvivalrateofE.coliBcellsofstationary
phase,whichtheCFUnumberandtheamountofSfactorencodedbytherpoSgene

observations suggest that SMFs are not always negative to the growth of microor-
ganism,whichare closely related totheintensitiesof SMFs,types ofbacteria,and
exposuremanners.
ThecombinedeffectsofSMFandotherenvironmentalfactorsonthegrowthof
microorganismsarelargelyunknown.Jietal.(2009)showedthataSMFof450mT
inhibited the growth and even killed E. coli, in which the inhibitory effect was
increased with temperature. Masahiro et al. (2000) compared the effect of SMF
exposure up to 100 mT on the culture of Streptococcus mutans (S. aureus) and
E. coli grown in aerobic and anaerobic conditions. They found that the bacterial
growthwasinhibitedbytheSMFinanaerobicconditions,butremainedunaffected
whentheSMFwasappliedinaerobicconditions,indicatingthatoxygenplayedan
inhibitoryeffectforthemagneticfield.LetutaandBerdinskiy(2019)foundthatthe
concurrent treatment of isotope 67Zn and 25–35 mT SMF increased the colony
formation ability and growth rate constant of E. coli by 2–4 times compared with
non-magneticzincisotopes64,66Zn.
There are few studies on thegrowth and sporulation ofphytopathogenic micro-
scopicfungiunderthestaticmagneticfields.NagyandFischl(2004)showedthatthe
appliedmagneticfieldswithfluxintensitiesrangingfrom0.1to1mTdecreasedthe
growthofphytopathogenicfungicoloniesandthenumberofFusariumoxysporum

Inyeast,LucielenOliveiraetal.(2010)showedthataSMFof25mTresultedin
an increase of glutathione content and biomass in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
(S. cerevisiae). Muniz et al. (2007) reported that the biomass (g/L) increment of
S. cerevisiae DAUFPE-1012 was 2.5 times greater in cultures exposed to 220 mT
SMFascomparedwithnon-exposedcultures.Kthirietal.(2019)furtherlyreported
thatunderthetreatmentof250mTSMF,thegrowthandviabilityofSaccharomyces

yeast. With the intensity increase of SMFs, Masakazu et al. (2004) found that
gradient magnetic fields of 14 T exhibited the decelerated growth in a liquid–gas
mixturesystem.
7.2.2 SMFonMorphologicalandBiochemicalModifications
The morphological study of SMF treated cells using transmission electron micro-
scope (TEM) revealed that bacterial cell wall was ruptured by SMF exposure
(Ji et al. 2009). Quiñones-Peña et al. (2017) reported that the prototype of E. coli:
strain-EPECE2348/69exposedto107mTSMFreduceditsaggregationandaltered
theadhesionpattern,whichwasrelatedtotheexpressionofitsBFPcilia.ASMFof
200 mT significantly altered the phospholipid proportions in Salmonella
typhimurium (S. typhimurium) wild type and dam mutant strain, which the most
affected were those of the acidic phospholipids, cardiolipins (CL) (Mouadh et al.
2012). Egami et al. (2010) investigated the effect of SMFs on the budding of
S. typhimurium and found that the size of budding yeast cells and the budding
angle were affected by a SMF of 2.93 T. In homogeneous magnetic field, the
budding direction of daughter yeast cells was mainly oriented in the direction of
magnetic field B; in contrast, in inhomogeneous magnetic field, the daughter yeast
cells tended to bud along the axis of capillary flow in regions where the magnetic
gradientwashigh.
Microorganisms as models for analyzing fundamental metabolic responses to
magnetic fields have great advantages, as they represent simple unicellular organ-
isms. Letuta (2020) found that the maximum concentration of ATP was generated
undertheactionofthemagneticisotope25MgandanelectroSMFof70–90mT.The
compositionofmembranelipidsinS.typhimuriumwasdisturbedby200mTSMF,
whichthebacteriatriedtochangeSFA,UFA,andCFA,andhydroxylFAlevelsto
maintain membrane fluidity, while the UFAs/SFAs ratio of Salmonella reached
equilibrium after 9 h of exposure (Ramla et al. 2017). Similarly, Mihoub et al.
(2012)showedthataSMFof200mTsignificantlyaffectedthelipidproportionsin
membrane, leading to an unusual accumulation of the acidic phospholipids

cardiolipins, with a significant increase of membrane cyclic fatty acids and a
meaningfulincreaseofthetotalunsaturatedfattyacidstototalsaturatedfattyacids
ratios of the exposed cells. Tang et al. (2019) exposed Flavobacterium m1–14 to
100mTSMFfor0,24,48,72,or120h,respectively,andfoundthatthelengthofthe
cells increased significantly by SMF treatment. Compared with the control group,
after 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 120 h of 100 mT SMF treatment, the length of the cell
increasedby 123%, 258%, 70.1%, and 31.2%, respectively; among them,the cells
treatedbythemagneticfieldfor48hweremoreelongated(Fig.7.1).Theinhibition
of mycelia growth by a SMF of 300 mT was accompanied by morphological and
biochemical changes, and Ca2+-dependent signal transduction pathways were
involved in conidia germination (Maria Cristina et al. 2003). The patterns of
metabolitesreleasedfromS.pyogenesexposedtodifferentmagneticfluxintensities
rangingfrom50to500mTweresignificantlyaltered(Morrowetal.2007).ASMF

in the secondary structures of protein were altered into α-helices by 10 T SMF; in
contrast,10TSMFhadlittleinfluenceonStaphylococcusaureus(S.aureus).
7.2.3 SMF on Genotoxicity
Inlivingorganisms,theproductionoffreeradicalshasthepotentialtointeractwith

yieldof8-hydroxyguanineinextractedDNAcomparedtocontrols,suggestingsome
possible antioxidant protection to S. pyogenes at this field strength (Morrow et al.
2007).CarliozandTouati(1986)showedaninductionoftheexpressionofasoxS::
lacZ fusion gene following strong SMF exposure. Fan et al. (2018) confirmed that
Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) could induce a stress response by upregulating
the expression of dnaK gene and the expression of virulence genes efaA and ace
under the treatment of SMF. Righi et al. (2020) exposed irradiated Deinococcus
radiodurans (D. radiodurans) cells to SMF and found that their cell viability was
improved, which might be due to the improvement of the efficiency of DNA
fragmentrecombinationbySMFexposure.
The direct evidence on the genotoxicity of SMFs is limited and controversial.
Mahdietal.(1994)exposedvariousmutantstrainsofE.colitoahomogeneousSMF
of either 500 mT or 3 T. No evidence of increased DNA damage was detected in
SMF-sexposedE.coli,evenwithbacterialstrainsdisabledforDNArepair.Masateru
et al. (1999) performed a bacterial mutation assay to determine the mutagenic
potential of SMF. No mutagenic effects were detected in four uvrB strains of
S. typhimurium (TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537) and E. coli WP2uvrA.

any alteration in the number of His+ revertants in Salmonella mutagenicity test.
Yoshie et al. (2012) reported that no statistically significant differences in the
mutation frequency in thymine synthesis genes were observed between
SMF-exposed cells and unexposed cells at any of the applied magnetic flux inten-
sities. SMFs up to 13 T caused neither mutagenicity nor co-mutagenicity in the
superoxide dismutase(SOD)-deficient E.coli strain QC774 orinitsparentalstrain
GC4468, suggesting that exposure to high SMFs did not affect the behavior of
superoxide in these microorganisms. However, the modification of chromatin con-
formationwasreportedinE.colicellsbyBelyaevetal.(1994).Zhangetal.(2003)
showedadose–responserelationshipbetweenthemagneticfluxintensity(5and9T

7.2.4 SMF on Gene and Protein Expression
Differential gene expression is a critical event, common to all biological systems,
allowing the accurate response under normal conditions and adaptation to various
environmentalstressesincludingmagneticfields.Tsuchiyaetal.(1999)reportedthat
inhomogeneousmagneticfieldsrangingfrom5.2to6.1Tenhancedthetranscription

exposed to 300 mT SMF, whereas one cDNA was more expressed in the controls
(Potenzaetal.2004).ElMayetal.(2009)foundthattheexpressionlevelofthe16S

analysis provided a further overview of potentially important cytosolic proteins, in
which a total of 35 proteins displaying more than a twofold change were differen-
tially expressed in exposed cells, among which 25 were upregulated and 10 were
downregulated. The stress response to a SMF of 200 mT was essentially set up to
avoid oxidative damages, with the overexpression of proteins directly involved in
oxidative stress response and metabolic switches to counteract oxidative stress
(Snoussietal.2016).
7.2.5 Magnetosome Formation Sensing Magnetic Fields
Microbialmagnetosomesrepresentaspecialcategoryofintracellularorganellesthat
are synthesized by magnetotactic bacteria (MTB). As a group of Gram-negative
aquatic prokaryotes, MTB had a broad range of morphological types, including
vibrioid, coccoid, rod, and spirillum. They used the magnetosomes to sense and
modify their orientation according to the magnetic field (Moisescu et al. 2014).
Magnetosomescomprisedmagneticiron-bearinginorganiccrystalsenvelopedbyan
organic membrane (Staniland et al. 2007). The membrane of magnetosomes
containedauniquesetofproteinsthatwerethoughttodirectthebiomineralization
of magnetite crystals and magnetosome chain formation and regulation (Komeili
etal.2004).Forty-eightproteinswereidentifiedasmagnetosome-specificproteinsin
Magnetospirillum magneticum (M. magneticum) AMB-1, and at least 13 proteins
were potentially involved in the formation of magnetosomes, which were encoded
bythemamandmmsgenes(Matsunagaetal.2005).Amongthegenesknowntobe
essential for magnetosome formation, magA, mms6, mamA, and mms13 were
involved in iron uptake (Chikashi et al. 1995; Grünberg et al. 2001), synthesis of
magnetite crystals of a uniform size and narrow size distribution with a cubo-
octahedral morphology (Amemiya et al. 2007), magnetosome assembly (Komeili
etal.2004),andformationofmagnetosomes,respectively.Thesuperiorcrystalline
and magnetic properties of magnetosomes have been attracting much interest in
studyingbiomineralizationandmedicalapplicationssuchasdrugdelivery,magnetic
resonance imaging, and array-based assaying (Yoshino and Matsunaga 2006;
Matsunagaetal.2007;Barber-Zuckeretal.2016).
Wang et al. (2008) found that exposure to hypomagnetic field less than 500 nT
restrainedthegrowthofM.magneticumstrainAMB-1duringthestationaryphase,
butincreasedthepercentageofbacteriathatcontainedmatureSDmagnetosomesin
their exponential growth phase. The average size of magnetic particles in cells
exposed to hypomagnetic field was larger (>50 nm) and they contained a larger
proportion(57%)ofSDparticlescomparedtothosegrowninthegeomagneticfield
only. 200 mT SMF could impair the cellular growth and raise Cmag values of
the cultures (Wang et al. 2009). The number of magnetic particles per cell and the
linearity of magnetosome chain were affected by SMF exposure. Moreover, the
expressionofmamA,mms13,magAgeneswasupregulatedbySMF.Blondeauetal.

7.2.6 Application of Static Magnetic Fields on Antibiotic
Resistance, Fermentation, and Wastewater Treatment
The application of SMF of 0.5 ± 2 mT significantly enhanced the activity of the
antibiotic gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Benson et al. 1994).
Stanselletal.(2001)foundthatexposureofE.colitoSMFof4.5mTsignificantly
increased its antibiotic resistance. Tagourti et al. (2010) showed that exposure to a
200 mT SMF increased the efficiency of gentamicin against S. Hadar, but did not
affect the diameter of the inhibition zone of some other antibiotics actives on
Enterobacteria: penicillin, oxacillin, cephalotin, neomycin, amikacin, tetracycline,
erythromycin,spiramycin,chloramphenicol,nalidixicacid,andvancomycin.How-
ever, Grosman et al. (1992) reported that a SMF of 0.5 ± 4.0 T had no significant
influenceonthegrowthoftwostrainsofE.coliorS.aureusafterexposuretimeof
30±120min,norwerethereanyeffectsonsensitivitytoseveralantibiotics.
TheinfluenceofSMFonfermentationprocesshasbeeninvestigatedinbiomass,

to220mTSMFsignificantlyincreasedthebiomass(g/L)ofS.cerevisiaestrainby
2.5-fold and the concentration of ethanol by 3.4-fold as compared with SMF
non-exposed cultures. Glucose consumption was higher in magnetized cultures,
which was correlated to the ethanol yield. Invertase is an enzyme
(b-fructofuranosidase, EC 3.2.1.26) used to produce noncrystallizable sugar syrup
fromsucrose.Taskinetal.(2013)showedthatthemaximuminvertaseactivityand
biomassconcentrationwereachievedwiththesporesexposedto5mTSMF.
Enhancement of biochemical processes by SMF has been applied in biological
wastewatertreatment.SMFhadapositiveeffectonactivatedsludgebiomassgrowth
and dehydrogenase activity, which was similar to the observation in p-nitroaniline
removal with activated sludge (Niu et al. 2014). Low and moderate SFMs could
enhance the activities and growth of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, increasing the
removaloforganicpollutantsfromwastewater(Jiaetal.2018).TheeffectofSMF
exposure on the biodegradation rate of a mixture of pollutants was investigated by
three strains including Pseudomonas stutzeri LBR (KC157911), Cupriavidus
metallidurans LBJ (KU659610), and Rhodococcus equi LBB (KU743870) isolated
andidentifiednearBizerte,Tunisia.Mansourietal.(2019)applied200mTtothese
threestrainsandfoundtherewasanincreaseby20%inthegrowthoftheexposed
bacterialpopulationcomparedtocontrols,and98%ofbiodegradationofDDTand
90% for BaP after 30 days of follow-up. The efficiency of phenol biodegradation
was greatly increased by 30% under moderate SMFs (Kriklavova et al. 2014).
Krzemieniewski et al. (2003) reported that a SMF of 400–600 mT stimulated the
conditioningofwastewatersludge.Asignificant30%increaseinmaximumnitrogen
removal rate and an approximate 1/4 saving in cultivation time were achieved by
usingaSMFof60mT,indicatingthatthemagneticfieldwasusefulandreliablefor

system,Tuetal.(2015)reportedthatSMFstimulatedbothalgalgrowthandoxygen

Inadditiontotheapplicationinwastewaterbiologicaltreatment,SMFsalsohave
broad application prospects for decolorization and de-oiling. In terms of decolori-
zation reactions, Shao et al. (2019) studied the decolorization effect of marine
microbial communities on azo dyes under SMF and found that the decolorization,
chemicaloxygendemand(COD)removal,anddetoxificationefficiencywerehigher
at 45.3 mT SMF. Tan et al. (2020) found that the SMF and the salt-tolerant yeast
Candida tropicalis SYF-1 co-enhanced SBR (named MSF-SBR) had higher and
morestableARB(acidity)underhighsaltandcontinuousoperatingconditionsRed
B processing efficiency (Shao et al. 2019). Ren et al. (2018) studied the effect of

7.3.3 SMF on Gravitropism
Gravitropism is the most conspicuous response to the gravitational force in plants,
whichplaysanessentialroleinmaintainingthespatialorientationofseedlingsand
stable balance of massive plants. The ability of plants to sense gravity is largely
attributedtostarch-filledamyloplasts,whichisalong-livedresponsethroughoutthe
entire life. Kuznetsov and Hasenstein (1996) reported that high-gradient magnetic
fields(HGMFs)inducedintracellularmagnetophoresisofamyloplasts.Theshootsof

Weise et al. (2000) reported that Arabidopsis stems positioned in a high-gradient
magnetic field (HGMF) on a rotating clinostat showed the lack of apical curvature
after basal amyloplast displacement, indicating that gravity perception in the base

was not transmitted to the apex. Jin et al. (2019) reported that root growth was
significantly enhanced by SMFs in an intensity and magnetic direction dependent
way, which was mediated by CRY and auxin signaling pathways in Arabidopsis.
Hasensteinetal.(2013)examinedthemovementofstarchgrainsofcorn,wheat,and
potato (Solanum tuberosum) in suspension during parabolic flights and found that

7.3.4 SMF on Photosynthesis
The effects ofSMF onthephotosynthesis have beeninvestigated invariousplants
includingsoybean,corn,Lemnaminor,andlettuce.Shineetal.(2011)reportedthat
presowing magnetic treatment could improve biomass accumulation in soybean.
Polyphasic chlorophyll a fluorescence transient from magnetically treated soybean
plants gave a higher fluorescence yield. Baghel et al. (2016) provided further
evidence that polyphasic chlorophyll a fluorescence (OJIP) transient from magnet-
ically treated plants gave a higher fluorescence yield at J–I–P phase. Moreover,
nitrate reductase activity, PIABS, photosynthetic pigments, and net rate of photo-
synthesis were also higher in plants that emerged from soybean seeds exposed to
200 mT SMF. In corn plants, Anand et al. (2012) reported that SMFs of 100 and
200 mT increased the photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and chlorophyll con-
tent. The pretreatment of seeds of two corn cultivars with different magnetic
treatments significantly alleviated the drought-induced adverse effects on growth
by improving chlorophyll, photochemical quenching, and non-photochemical
quenching(Javedetal.2011).Janetal.(2015)foundthatthereducedgeomagnetic
field (GMF) significantly stimulated growth rate of the total frond area in the
magneticallytreatedLemnaminorplants,whiletheenhancedGMFpointedtoward
inhibition of growth rate in exposed plants in comparison to control, but the
difference was not statistically significant. All photosynthetic pigments in lettuce
seeds(Lactucasativavar.capitataL.)wereinducedmarkedlyunder0.44T,0.77T,
and1TSMF,especiallychlorophylla(Latefetal.2020).
TherearefewstudiesonthecoeffectsofSMFsandotherenvironmentalfactors

enhancement of leaf growth along with photosynthesis even under the presence of
ambientUV-Bstress.Moreover,pretreatmentwith50–300mTSMFincreasedwater

MFintensity.
7.3.5 SMF on Redox Status
The uncoupling of free radicals including reactive oxygen/nitrogen species
(ROS/RNS) is involved in the underlying mechanism of SMF induced oxidative
stressinplants.Theactivitiesoffreeradicalscavengingenzymes,includingcatalase
(CAT),superoxidedismutase(SOD),glutathionereductase(GR),glutathionetrans-
ferase (GT), peroxidase (POD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and polyphenol oxi-
dase(POP),havebeenwelldocumentedtobealtered bySMFexposureinvarious
plants, including pea, radish (Raphanus sativus), Leymus chinensis, soybean,
cucumber (Cucumis sativus), broad bean, corn, parsley (Petroselinum crispum),
and wheat (Regoli et al. 2005; Baby et al. 2011; Jouni et al. 2012). Mohammadi
et al. (2018) found that 0.2 mT SMF increased the contents of nitric oxide (NO),
hydrogen peroxide (HO), and salicylic acid (SA) in tobacco cells (Nicotiana
tabacum cv. Barley 21), and suggested that a signaling pathway activated by SMF
startingfromaccumulationofNOandHO,thenincreasedthecyclicnucleotidesand
subsequent decreased the cyclin-dependent kinases A (CDKA) and D-type cyclin
(CycD).Cakmaketal.(2012)reportedthatSMFof7mTincreasedlipidperoxida-
tion and H O levels in shallot (Allium ascalonicum) leaves. Jouni et al. (2012)
2 2
found that treatment of plants with 15 mT SMF caused accumulation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS), lowered the antioxidant defense system, and increased the
peroxidation of membrane lipids in broad bean (Vicia faba L.). Shokrollahi et al.
(2018) found that 20 mT SMF decreased ferrous and HO contents, content and
activity of ferritin and catalase in soybean plants, but the opposite responses were
observedunder30mTtreatments.Shineetal.(2012)showedthatSMFsof150and
200 mT enhanced production of ROS mediated by cell wall peroxidase, while the
increase in the cytosolic peroxidase activity indicated that this antioxidant enzyme
had a vital role in scavenging the increased H O produced in seedlings from the
2 2
magnetically treated soybean seeds. In mung bean seedlings treated with 600 mT
SMFfollowedbycadmiumstress,Chenetal.(2011)foundthattheconcentrationof

7.3.6 Cryptochromes Sensing Magnetic Field
Cryptochromes(CRYs)areflavoproteinsthatdirectadiversearrayofdevelopmen-
tal processes in response to blue light in plants (Yu et al. 2010). CRY has been
suggested to be a potential magnetoreceptor for light-initiated electron transfer
chemistry which might be magnetically sensitive to virtue of the radical pair
mechanism (Evans and Davidson 2013; Hore and Mouritsen 2016). Geomagnetic
field(GMF)hasbeenhypothesizedtoaffecttheredoxbalanceofcryptochromesand
the related signaling state (Vanderstraeten et al. 2015); however, the influence of
strongSMFonthefunctionofCRYsisstilllargelyunexplored.
ThreeCRYs,CRY1,CRY2,andCRY3areencodedinArabidopsisgenome(Lin
andTodo2005).CRY1andCRY2functionasmajorbluelightreceptorsregulating

etal.2016).Xuetal.(2014)foundSMFof500μTmodifiedthefunctionofCRYs.
The blue light-dependent phosphorylations of CRY1 and CRY2 were enhanced in
Arabidopsisseedlingsgrownina500μTMF,whereasthenear-nullMFweakened

whereasdephosphorylationsofCRY1andCRY2wereaccelerated inthenear-null
MF.Accordingtothecalculationofradicalpairmechanisminarelativelyrealistic
model of the radical pair system in Arabidopsis CRY1, Solov’yov et al. (2007)
showedthat500μTMFcouldincreasethesignalingactivityofcryptochromebyup
to10%,suggestingthatthefunctionofCRYswasaffectedbymagneticfield.Pooam
etal.(2019)investigatedtheresponseofArabidopsisCRY1invivoto500μTSMF
usingbothplantgrowthandlight-dependentphosphorylationasanassay,thenthey
found that the magnetically sensitive reaction step in the cryptochrome photocycle
must occur during flavin reoxidation, and likely involved the formation of ROS.
Ahmad et al. (2007) reported that 500 μT MF enhanced the blue light-dependent
inhibition of hypocotyl growth of Arabidopsis. Hypocotyl growth of Arabidopsis
mutantslacking CRYs was unaffected by theincreaseof magnetic intensity, while
cryptochrome-dependentresponses,suchasbluelight-dependentanthocyaninaccu-
mulationandbluelight-dependentdegradationofCRY2protein,wereenhancedat
the higher magnetic intensity. However, with experimental conditions chosen to
match Ahmad’s study, Harris et al. (2009) found that in no case consistent, statis-
ticallysignificantMFresponsesweredetected.
CRYsevolvedfromphotolyasesareconservedacrossmanydifferentspecies.In

and there was no evidence for intracellular magnetite in putative vertebrate
magnetoreceptors identified by magnetic screening (Möller et al. 2004;N ießner
et al. 2013; Edelman et al. 2015). In animals, CRYs also functioned as circadian
photoreceptors in the Drosophila brain, mediating the light resetting of the 24 h
clock; but in vertebrates, the CRYs acted as the main negative regulators for the
circadian feedback loop, due to the difference in light sensing (Yoshii et al. 2009;

(2016) provided evidence that exposure to a MF of 100 mT was sufficient to
potentiate the ability of light-activated cryptochrome to increase neuronal action
potential firing, indicating that the activity of cryptochrome was sensitive to an
externalMFthatwascapableofmodifyinganimalbehavior.
7.4 SMF on Animals
7.4.1 SMF on Caenorhabditis elegans
Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is a small free-living nematode that has been
widelyutilizedtoaddressfundamentalquestionsofdevelopmentalbiology,neuro-
biology,andbehavioralbiology.C.elegansissimilartohighereukaryotesinmany
molecular and cellular pathways (Kaletta and Hengartner 2006) and offers unique
advantages, including the ease of maintenance, small size, short life cycle, genetic
manipulability,stereotypicaldevelopment,andhigh-throughputcapability.Asabout
50% of its genes have human homologs, C. elegans based assays are increasingly
usedtoevaluatepotentialtoxicityofdifferentstressorsinhumansandmechanisms
oftoxicitybyphysicalandchemicalexposures(KazazianJr.2004;Denggandvan
Meel2004;Rajinietal.2008;Sprandoetal.2009;Boydetal.2010).
Recent evidence has shown that the C. elegans oriented to the earth’s magnetic
fieldduringverticalburrowingmigrationsneuronpair(Vidal-Gadeaetal.2015).A

ing temporal, spatial, and environmental factors. They found that the magnetic
orientation of these “small worm” might be stronger under dry conditions (<50%
RH) (Bainbridge et al. 2020). Using worms with mutations at some of the genes
expressedintheAFDneuronsandacalciumsensitiveprotein,itwasfoundthatthe

byserotonininC.elegans.
The biological effects of SMFs on C. elegans have been focused on the devel-
opment, aging process, behavior, and global gene expression. Hung et al. (2010)
reportedthattreatmentwith200mTSMFreducedthedevelopmenttimefromtheL2
totheL3stageby20%,fromL3toL4by23%,andfromL4toyoungadultby31%.
WithSMFtreatment,theaveragelifespanwasreducedfrom31to24daysinwild-
type nematodes.Theupregulation oflim-7,clk-1,daf-2, unc-3, andage-1 by SMF
treatmentwasverifiedbyquantitative real-time PCR; incontrast,lifespan analyses
showed that SMF treatment had no effect on let-7, unc-3, and age-1 mutants,
indicating that the induction of gene expression by SMFs was selective and dose-
dependent. Lee et al. (2012) showed that long-term and low-dosage exposure to
200mTSMFwascapableofinducinganapoptosis-mediatedbehavioraldeclinein
nematodes. 26 differentially expressed genes including apoptosis, oxidative stress,
andcancer-relatedgeneswereidentified,indicatingthataglobalmolecularresponse
to SMF exposure occurred. Mutations in genes involved in major apoptotic path-
ways, that is, ced-3, ced-4, and ced-9, abolished this SMF-induced behavioral
decline. Kimura et al. (2008) reported that genes involved in motor activity, actin
binding,celladhesion,andcuticlesweretransientlyandspecificallyinducedby3or
5 T SMF exposure in C. elegans. Several genes encoding apoptotic cell-death
activators and secreted surface proteins were upregulated by ionizing radiation,
instead of SMFs. Exposure to 3 or 5 T SMFs did not induce DNA double-strand
breaks or germline cell apoptosis during meiosis. However, we found that 8.5 T
SMFsresultedinatime-dependentlifespandecreaseandalterationofdevelopment
rate and stages in C. elegans. Germ cell apoptosis dramatically increased upon
exposure to 8.5 T SMF in worms via core apoptotic machinery, which could be
preventedbyconcurrenttreatmentwithafreeradicalscavenger,dimethylsulfoxide

that sperms were sensitive targets of high SMFs as shown in Figs. 7.5 and 7.6.
Although 10 T SMF had little effect on the morphology of sperms, the size of

increased mortality of eggs, larvae, and pupa, and diminished adult viability in
Drosophila (Ramirez et al. 1983). Decreased hatching rate after exposure to a
weak SMF during early embryogenesis was also obtained in D. melanogaster and
Heliothis virescens (tobacco budworm) (Ho et al. 1992; Pan 1996). A significant
increaseofHylotrupesbajulusviabilityandlarvalmasswasreportedafterexposure
to a SMF of 98 mT (Rauš Balind et al. 2009). The SMF of 60 mT reduced the
embryonic and post-embryonic development and induced weaker viability in two
different species, Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila hydei (Savić et al.
2011). Todorovic et al. (2019) found that chronic exposure to 110 mT SMF
significantly decreased the gut mass and the activity of glutathione reductase
(GR) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) as compared to the control in Blaptica
dubia (B. dubia). They further reported that 110 mT SMF decreased nymph body
massandglycogencontentinthefatbodybutincreasedallexaminedparametersof
locomotion, indicating that B. dubia nymphs were sensitive to SMF exposure
(Todorovicetal.2020).OakandbeechpopulationsofDrosophilasubobscurahad
longer development time, and lower viability was observed in N and S groups of
2.4 T SMF, which was mediated by oxidative stress (Todorović et al. 2015).
Apparent hatching delay of strong magnetic fields was observed in mosquito eggs
inthecenterof9.4and14.1Tmagnets(PanandLiu2004).
In insects, the neuroendocrine system is a main regulator of all aspects of life
processes, such as development and behavior, and the detection and activity of an

TheantennallobeofDrosophilaprovidesanidealintactneuralnetworkmodelto

a SMF of 3.0 T modilated the rhythmic spontaneous activities of large LNs and
correlated activity of ipsilateral pairs of large LN/LN in Drosophila antennal lobe,
indicatingthat Drosophilacould bean idealintactneural circuitmodel toevaluate
theeffectsofmagneticfieldstimulations.
Mutagenic effects of a static magnetic field were investigated by increasing
mutation rate in population of Drosophila exposed to magnetic field 10–12 times
greater than geomagnetic one (Giorgi et al. 1992). Exposure to 2, 5, or 14 T fields

Theinteractionamongneuronsinescapecircuitofcrayfishhasbeenwellstudied.
As the lateral giant (LG) neuron was easytoaccess forelectrophysiological study,
Ye et al. (2004) found that exposure to SMF at 4.74–43.45 mT increased the
amplitude of action potential (AP) in LG depending upon both the intensity of

As an increasingly important model species in genetic and neurobehavioral
studies, zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an excellent organism for better understanding
the biological mechanism of SMFs. Using a fast, fully automated assay system
relying on negative reinforcement, Shcherbakov et al. (2005) recorded statistically

fish migrating regularly between freshwater and the sea, and non-migratory
zebrafish. Takebe et al. (2012) found that zebrafish responded to a magnetic field
as weak as the geomagnetic field by bidirectional orientation with group-specific
preferences regardless of close kinships. SMFs with density from 4.7 to 11.7 T

was greatly suppressed by strong SMF. Mietchen et al. (2005) investigated the

The effects of SMF exposure on nerve conduction were investigated in frog
sciatic nerves. A significant increase in the nerve conduction velocity (NCV)
of compound action potentials (CAP) in sciatic nerves was observed by exposure
toauniformSMFof1.16T.Edelmanetal.(1979)observedasignificantincreasein

clinical features of bone loss, Xu et al. (2010) observed that SMF significantly
increased the BMD of osteoporotic lumbar vertebrate without affecting the E2

7.4.6.2 SMFonCardiovascularSystem
BloodPressureandBloodFlow
SMF in the mT range has been reported to modulate circulatory hemodynamics
and/or arterial blood pressure (BP) and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS). Okano and
Ohkubo (2003, 2005, 2006) found that whole-body exposure to SMF suppressed
spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), which was mediated by nitric oxide
(NO)pathway,Ca2+channel,andhormonalregulatorysystems.Withthecalculation
of the hematological characteristics, Tasic et al. (2021) found that SMFs with
differentorientationshadadverseeffectsonthehematologicalindicatorsofsponta-

stationary fields of 2–7 T and rabbits exposed to 1 T SMF (Beischer and Knepton
Jr. 1964; Togawa et al. 1967). Similar observation was reported by Gaffey and
Tenforde (1981) that a field strength dependent increase in the amplitude of the
T-wave signal in the rat ECG was revealed during exposure to homogeneous
stationary magnetic fields of 2 T, which might be due to a superimposed electrical
potential generated by aortic blood flow in the presence of a stationary magnetic
field.TheexposureofratstoaSMFof128mTdecreasedtheactivitiesofglutathione
peroxidase (GPx) and the CuZn superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) in rat cardiac
muscle(Amaraetal.2009).
HematologicalParameters
The effects of SMFs on hematological parameters have been studied in rats at the
intensity of 128 mT. Amara et al. (2006b) reported that a SMF of 128 mT signifi-
cantly decreased the growth rates, but increased the plasmatic total protein levels,
hemoglobin,redbloodcells,whitebloodcells,plateletnumber,andtheactivitiesof
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine ami-
notransferase(ALT)inmaleWistarrats;incontrast,theglucoseconcentrationwas
unaffected. Milovanovich et al. (2016) showed that both upward- and downward-
orientedSMFof128mTcausedareductionintheamountoftotalwhitebloodcells
(WBC). Chater et al. (2006) found that subacute exposure to a SMF of 128 mT
stimulated biosynthesis of plasma corticosterone and metallothionein activities in
femalerats,whileincreasedbloodglucoseanddecreasedinsulinrelease,leadingtoa
diabetic-like state in pregnant rats. Elferchichi et al. (2016) showed an impaired
glucosehomeostasisandaderegulatedlipidmetabolismafterSMFexposureinadult
rats. But, they noticed that a SMF of 128 mT induced a pseudoanemia status with
increasedmonocarboxylatetransporters(MCT4)andglucosetransporter4(Glut4).

that differently oriented SMF of 16 mT did not alter hemoglobin and hematocrit,

could prevent toxic effects of SMFs probably by its antioxidant proprieties
(Ghodbaneetal.2011).
7.4.6.3 SMFonDigestiveSystem
The effects of SMFs on digestive system are largely unknown and most of studies
mainly focus on the intensity of 128 mT. A SMF of 128 mT increased total GSH

7.4.6.4 SMFonEndocrineSystem
TheinfluenceofSMFsonendocrinesystemhasbeenlinkedtotheirfunction,such
as insulin, pineal gland, and testis. Jing et al. (2010) found that 180 mT SMF

SMFs promoted diabetic mice wound healing by suppressing oxidative stress.
Elferchichi et al. (2011) showed that the metabolic alterations following exposure

Bellossi (1986) showed that the lifetime was prolonged significantly by uniform
SMFs of 600 or 800 mT in female AKR mice, which developed spontaneous

7.4.7 Magnetic Sensing Protein in Animals
Many animals have evolved to sense the direction of the geomagnetic field for
orientation, navigation, and migration over long distances. The blue light receptor
CRYsthatcouldformradicalpairsafterexposuretobluelightweresuggestedtobe
a magnetoreceptor based on the proposition that radical pairs were involved in the
magnetoreception. CRYs are expressed not only in plant, but also in newts, fruit
flies, birds, and the eyes of mammals (Möller et al. 2004; Nießner et al. 2013).
Gegearetal.(2008)reportedthatcrymutantsofDrosophilamelanogastershowed
neithernaivenoramagneticfield,whilethewild-typefliesshowedsignificantnaive
and trained responses to the magnetic field. Expression of monarch butterfly
(Danaus plexippus) cryptochrome gene in Drosophila cry mutants rescued the
responses to the magnetic field (Gegear et al. 2010). Marley et al. (2014) reported
that MF exposure coupled with CRY photoactivation during embryogenesis was
sufficienttoproduceheightenedseizuresusceptibilityinresultantDrosophilathird
instar (L3) larvae. Giachello et al. (2016) provided new evidence that exposure to
MF of 100 mT was sufficient to potentiate the ability of light-activated CRY to
increase neuronal action potential firing, indicating that the activity of CRY was
sensitive toan externalMF that was capable ofmodifying animalbehavior. CRYs
alsofunctionascircadianphotoreceptorsintheDrosophilabrain,mediatingthelight
resetting of the 24 h clock, but in vertebrates, the CRYs act as the main negative
regulators for the circadian feedback loop, due to the difference in light sensing
(Yoshiietal. 2009;Fedeleetal.2014).Non-DrosophilainsectsencodeCRY1and
CRY2, but CRY1 retains their light-sensing properties, whereas the CRY2s act as
vertebrate-likenegativeregulators.
InordertoinvestigateapossibleinteractionbetweenCRY4andtheiron-sulfur-
containing assembly protein (ISCA1) from European robin (Erithacus rubecula),
CRY4 has recently been proposed to be relevant for magnetic field sensing. Kimø
etal.(2018)reportedthattheISCA1complexandCRY4werecapableofbinding;
however,thepeculiaritiesofthisbindingargue strongly againstISCA1asrelevant
for magnetoreception. In the fruit fly, CRY plays a light-independent role as
“assembling” protein in the rhabdomeres of the compound eyes (Schlichting et al.
2018). Schleicher et al. (2017) demonstrated that photo-induced electron transfer
reactions in Drosophila melanogaster cryptochrome were indeed influenced by
magneticfieldsofafewmillitesla.Güntheretal.(2018)sequencednight-migratory

photochemistry of cryptochrome 4 (CRY4) from the night-migratory European
robin (Erithacus rubecula) was magnetically sensitive in vitro, and more so than
CRY4 from two non-migratory bird species, chicken (Gallus gallus) and pigeon
(Columba livia). Site-specific mutations of ErCRY4 revealed the roles of four
successive flavin-tryptophan radical pairs in generating magnetic field effects and
in stabilizing potential signaling states in a way that could enable sensing and
signaling functions to be independently optimized in night-migratory birds. Wan

havebeenperformedatupto9.4and21.1T,respectively.Inthemeanwhile,strong
SMFs may also be generated by thermonuclear reactors, magnetohydrodynamic
systems,andsuperconductinggenerators.Thefacilitiesequippedwithbubblecham-
bers,particleaccelerators,superconductingspectrometers,andisotopedeviceswith
highmagneticfluxdensityseparationunitsmayhaveareasaroundthese.However,
dataonlivingorganismsfromexposuretostrongSMFshavenotbeensufficientto
evaluate these potential ecosystem risks and explore the function of
magnetoreception.

Static Magnetic Fields on Human Bodies
XinZhang
Abstract With the development of modern technologies, people have increased
exposure to various types of electromagnetic fields, including static magnetic field
(SMF). Accordingly, World Health Organization and international commission on
non-ionizing radiation protection have also publish guidelines for the safety appli-
cation of magnetic fields on human bodies. This chapter summarizes the study
resultsofSMFeffectonhumanbodies,aswellassomemagneticfieldapplications
in medicine (magnetomedicine). It not only includes some commonly seen SMFs,

Magnetic surgery, magnetoencephalography, and magnetocardiogram, which have
beenusedinclinics,arealsobrieflyintroduced.SMF-basedmagnetictherapiesare
also discussed, which have a long-debated history and still lack of systematic
mechanics investigations and sufficient double-blinded, randomized and placebo-
controlledhumanstudies.Basedontheresearchprogressesinthelastfewdecades,

externally applied magnetic field, the electron motions in diamagnetic molecules
makesmallchanges,whichgenerateweakmagneticfieldsintheoppositedirection
totheexternalMFs.Althoughthediamagneticpropertiesofmostlivingorganisms
are very weak, since the repulsive force is proportional to the product of the MF
intensityandthefieldgradient,theforcescanbeamplifiedbyultra-strongmagnetic
field. For example, the most famous case is the “flying frogs” a few decades years
ago. People put small diamagnetic objects such as water drops, flowers, grasshop-
pers,andsmallfrogsinthe16Tultra-strongstaticmagneticfield(SMF)produced
by a vertical electromagnet and levitated those small objects. Theoretically, the
human body could also be levitated if we have a vertically oriented, large-sized
high-fieldmagnet.
Duetothefastdevelopmentoftechnologies,peoplehaveincreasedexposureto
different kinds of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) nowadays. Most EMFs are time-
varying magnetic fields (also called dynamic magnetic fields), such as 50–60 Hz
power line EMFs as well as radiofrequency EMFs emitted by cell phones and
microwaves. Therefore, these EMFs have attracted paramount interests. There are
many reviews and books about this topic and we will not discuss about the details
here.ThefocusofourbookisSMFs,whichhavenon-changingmagneticfieldsover
a certain period of time (0 Hz). The most common SMFs that people are exposed
include the weak but ubiquitous Earth magnetic field/geomagnetic field (GMF)
(~0.5 Gauss, ~50 μT). In the meantime, people can also be exposed to magnetic
resonanceinimaging(MRI)scannersinthehospitals(mostofthemarebetween0.5
and 3 T), as well as permanent magnets of various magnetic intensities that some
peoplemayuseasalternativemedicineforsomechronicmedicalconditionssuchas
chronic pain relief, as well as small magnets that are frequently used in household
itemssuchasrefrigerators,toys,andaccessories.Moreover,withthedevelopmentof
ultra-high field MRI machines, people have increasing exposure to high SMFs,
which unsurprisingly raised new concerns. Therefore, the effects of SMFs and
their effects on human bodies certainly require more research to get a better
understanding.
From the safety point of view, since the public are always concerned about
various EMFs, (World Health Organization) WHO initiated the International EMF
project to assess health and environmental effects of exposure to static and time-
varying electric and MFs. More information can be found at the WHO website:
https://www.who.int/health-topics/electromagnetic-fields, or the international com-
missiononnon-ionizingradiationprotection(ICNIRP)website:https://www.icnirp.
org/. It should be mentioned that the ICNIRP updates their guidelines for
radiofrequencymagneticfieldsfrom100kHzto300GHz(https://www.icnirp.org/
en/frequencies/radiofrequency) very frequently, about every 2 years. As for now,
Aug2022,thelastupdatedradiofrequencymagneticfieldsguidelinewasin2020.In
contrast, the most updated guideline for SMFs was published in 2009 and has not
been updated since then (https://www.icnirp.org/en/frequencies/static-magnetic-
fields-0-hz).OneofthemostimportantreasonsforthisisthatSMFsaremuchsafer
thanEMFs.

WHO and ICNIRP have set the upper limit for SMF exposures for both public
andoccupationalexposures.AccordingtothelastguidelinepublishedbyICNIRPin
2009,theupperlimitforthepublicexposureis400mTandoccupationalexposureis
2 T/8 T (Table 8.1). The limit of exposure for general public of 400 mT was
calculatedbyapplyingareductionfactorof5–2T,whichhasbeenprovedtohave
no demonstrated robust effect on animals (Gaffey and Tenforde 1983; Tenforde
2005)orhumans.TheexposureofSMFsabove8Trequiresapprovaloftheresearch
protocol by an Institutional Review Board as well as the informed consent of the
subjects.
Although there are also some countries that have a stricter standard, such as
Bahrain, Republic of Korea, and Iran, the ICNIRP guideline published in 2019 is
stillthebasisformostcountriestosettheirstandards,especiallyfortheoccupational
exposure,asshownontheWHOwebsite(Table8.2).
8.2 Earth Magnetic Field/Geomagnetic Field (GMF)
As mentioned above, the most common SMF that all people are exposed to is the
Earth magnetic field/GMF, which is around 0.5 Gauss/50 μT (0.3–0.6 Gauss,
depending on locations). GMF is much weaker compared to other types of SMF
exposure but it is present everywhere and is exceptionally important to the living
organism on Earth. It is now known that the Earth can create a region around the
planet,calledthemagnetosphere.Itisbelievedthatplanetswithoutanintactglobal

It is well known that birds, bees, turtles, and some other animals are shown to
sense GMF for direction during migration and there are many studies about GMF
and animal magnetoception. There are also some other animal behaviors that were
reported to be correlated to GMF. For example, people found some interesting but
enigmaticphenomena that dogslike to align theirbodies along theEarth magnetic
fieldwhentheyexcrete(defecationandurination)(Hartetal.2013).Moreinforma-

Whether humans can sense GMF has always been debated. It is interesting that
there are a few new studies in recent few years indicating that humans can sense
EarthMF(Chaeetal.2019,2022;Wangetal.2019).In2019,Wangetal.reported
that the Earth-strength MFs can produce strong, specific, and repeatable effects on
human brainwave activity in the electroencephalography (EEG) alpha-band
(8–13 Hz), and they propose the mechanism to be related to ferromagnetic trans-
duction element, such as biologically precipitated crystals of magnetite (Fe O )
3 4
(Wang et al. 2019). On the other hand, Chae et al. also studied human
magnetoreceptionandstatedthatstarved menhavebettermagnetoreceptionability
than women (Chae et al. 2019). Recently, they indicated that a magnetic field
resonancemechanismmediateslight-dependentmagneticorientationinmen(Chae
etal.2022).Apparently,thisfieldstillremainsblurredandwearestillfarawayfrom

Inthemeantime,therearemultiplestudiesindicatingthatGMFcouldaffectother
aspects of human. For example, Thoss and Bartsch indicated that the GMF could
actually affect human visual system (Thoss and Bartsch 2003, 2007) although the
mechanism is not completely understood. Burch et al. indicated that the GMF can
affectmelatoninsecretion(Burchetal.2008),whichisapossiblemechanismforthe

showedthattheremayevenbesomeassociationbetweenGMFactivitywithdream
bizarreness (Lipnicki 2009). However, there are also some reports that reported
negative results. For example, in 2002, Sastre et al. examined the effects of con-
trolled changes in the GMF on 50 human volunteers for electroencephalogram
(EEG)anddidnotfindanyobviouscorrelation(Sastreetal.2002).Sincedifferent
aspectsweremeasuredintheseindividualstudies,theyarenotexactlycomparable.
Ontheotherhand,therearealsosomeevidencesshowingthatintheabsenceof
GMF, frequently referred to hypomagnetic field (HMF), the gene expression, cell
proliferation, migration, and adhesion of some human cancer cells could all be
affected (Martino and Castello 2011; Mo et al. 2013, 2014, 2016). For example,
Mo et al. did multiple studies about the effects of HMF on human SH-SY5Y
neuroblastoma cells. In 2013, they showed that continuous HMF exposure signifi-
cantly increases the proliferation of human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells by
promoting cell cycle progression (Mo et al. 2013); in 2014, they compared the

8.3 Time-Varying Magnetic Fields and Their Clinical
Applications
Although the focus of this book and this chapter are SMFs, here I want to briefly
introduce the time-varying magnetic fields and their clinical applications because
their successful development in clinics may shed light on the future progress of
SMFsinclinics.
8.3.1 Magnetoencephalography and Magnetocardiogram
Asmentionedinthebeginningofthischapter,thehumanbodyismainlycomposed
of weak diamagnetic materials, such as water, proteins, and lipids. However, our
bodiesalsogeneratecurrentsthatproducesmallmagneticfields(Cohenetal.1980).
Neurons in our brain, nerve cells, and muscle fibers are all excitable cells that can
generatecurrentswhentheyareactivated.Consequently,relevantinstrumentswere
alsodevelopedtomeasuretheseelectricactivities.Forexample,electrocardiogram
(ECG)measurestheelectricalactivityoftheheart,andelectroencephalogram(EEG)
measurestheelectricalactivityofthebrain,bothofwhichhavebeenwidelyusedin
clinic.
Magnetic fields produced by the human body have been measured, which are
actually very weak (10
-10
to 10
-5
gauss). It is well accepted that the human brain
can be divided into multiple areas, and each of them is responsible for different
aspects of behavior. The accurate and efficient connectivity between these areas is
criticalfornormalfunctionofahealthybrain.Althoughasingleneuroncouldonly
produce veryweakcurrent,itcanbeamplifiedwhen theneurons areclustered and
aligned together and excited simultaneously. In this case, the neurons can produce
magnetic fields that are strong enough to be detected using superconducting quan-
tum interference devices (SQUIDs) (Zimmerman et al. 1970; Hamalainen et al.
1993). Weak alternating magnetic fields outside the human scalp, produced by
alpha-rhythm currents, were demonstrated. The fields near the scalp are about 1 ×
10
-9
gauss (peak to peak) (Cohen 1968). Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a
noninvasive sophisticated technique that captures the magnetic fields generated by
synchronized intraneuronalelectricalactivity,whichyieldsrichinformation onthe
spatial, spectral, and temporal signatures of human brain function. It is capable of
imaging electrophysiological brain activity with good (~5 mm) spatial resolution
and excellent (~1 ms) temporal resolution and provides significant value in

elucidating the neural dynamics of the human connectome in health and disease
(O'Neill et al. 2015). There are many very useful reviews and research articles for
MEGs showing that neuroimaging methods like MEG represent an outstanding
approach to better understand the mechanisms of both normal and abnormal brain
functions(Brookesetal.2011;Heetal.2011;Pizzellaetal.2014;Kidaetal.2015;
O'Neill et al. 2015; Pang and Snead 2016; Stefan and Trinka 2017; Baillet 2017).
Similarly, magnetocardiogram (MCG) measures the magnetic fields of the heart,
whichisacomplementaryoralternativetoolfornoninvasivedetectionofcoronary
arterydisease(Kandorietal.2010;Wuetal.2013).
In addition, MEG appears to be more sensitive than EEG and can provide
additionalanddifferentinformationcomparedtoEEG(Cohen1972).MEGisuseful
for functional neurosurgery and connectivity analyses. Since MEG could offer
additional insights not possible by MRI when used to study complex network
function, people are combining MEG (which has high temporal resolution) with
functional MRI (fMRI), which has high spatial resolution, to provide more infor-
mationonhumanbrainfunction(Halletal.2014).Inparticular,MEGismostwidely
appliedtothestudyofepilepsy,abraindisorderthatcausespeopletohaveseizures
(Kim et al. 2016; Pang and Snead 2016). In addition, simultaneous MEG/EEG
recording and analysis could provide complimentary information and better detec-
tionsensitivityfortracingprimaryepilepticactivity(Hunoldetal.2016;Stefanand
Trinka2017).Moreover,forchronicneurologicaldisorderssuchasepilepsy,func-
tional connectivitydetectedthrough hemodynamic andelectromagnetic techniques
help to identify the interactions between epileptic activity and physiological net-
works at different scales. fMRI andEEG/MEG functional connectivity can help in
localizing important drivers of epileptic activity and can also help in predicting
postsurgicaloutcome(PittauandVulliemoz2015).Inrecentfewyears,withthehelp
of quantum sensors, people are able to develop MEG into a helmet-like wearable
device,whichdoesnotrelyonsuperconductingtechnologyandallowsthefreeand

known magnetic field-related therapeutical instrument that are applied in clinics
world widely. In fact, TMS is currently covered by some health insurance in the
United States to treat diseases like depression. Some of their applications may be
inspirational for people to study SMFs, especially for their applications in the
nervous system. There are many reviews that are helpful for people to get more
informationonthistopic(Hallett2007;Rossietal.2009;Pitcheretal.2021).

8.4 Static Magnetic Fields and Their Clinical Applications
Besides the weak GMF of ~50 μT, nowadays people have more chances to get
exposed to much stronger SMFs. On the one hand, MRI scanners are used in the
hospitalsall overtheworld,which isthebest applicationofhighmagnetic fieldin
human health. On the other hand, there are also some SMF-based magnetotherapy
products that are available in many countries and mostly used by people by them-
selves,whichwillbediscussedinmoredetailbyDr.KevinYaremainChap.15of
thisbook.
8.4.1 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
MRI has a superior soft-tissue contrast compared to other radiological imaging
methods, which makes it a powerful tool in many physiological and functional
applications. Currently, the SMF of most MRI scanners in hospitals is 0.5–3 T,
which is around 10,000–60,000 times higher than the GMF. This is exceptionally
strongerthantheGMForotherpermanentmagnetsthatpeoplecaneasilygetaccess
to.However,MRIisconsideredtobeaverysafediagnosistechnique,aslongasthe
operationfollowsthebasicguidelines.Forexample,peoplewithpacemakersshould
not use MRI because the pacemakers may be reprogrammed or turned off by the
MFsofMRI.Peoplewithsomeotherimplants,suchasferrousintra-cranialvascular
clips, should also avoid MRI because the strong SMF of MRI may cause possible
movementoftheimplants.CellphonesandcreditcardsmaybedamagedbytheMFs
sothattheyshouldalsobekeptoutoftheMRIroom.Itiswellrecognizedthatforthe
regular exposure to the MRI, there are some commonly experienced symptoms
including nausea and headaches, which are all reversible (Heilmaier et al. 2011).
ThiswillbediscussedinmoredetailsinChap.13ofthisbook.
Inthe meantime,since highSMF field canhelp providing enhanced sensitivity,
higher resolutionaswellasdecreasedacquisitiontime, MRImachineswithhigher
magnetic field strength are already developed. For example, the 7 T MRI can
obviously provide much more information than the 3 T or 1.5 T MRIs (Fig. 8.2).
Inthemeanwhile,peoplearecontinuouslyinvestigatingonbuildingMRImachines
withultra-highmagneticfields.Besidetheclinicalstudieson9.4TMRIs,the10.5T

rat brains using a 21.1 T MRI, the highest field MRI to date, at the National High
Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) in the United States. They were able to
achieve imaging resolution of 50 μM, which is much higher than the lower field

21.1 T MRI can provide much more detailed features about the tissues and blood

ofdevelopingsimilarMRIforhuman.
Since our knowledge of the biological effects of SMFs will guide us for future
increase in field strength for MRI to benefit medical diagnosis, more studies are
definitelyneededtoinvestigatethebiologicaleffectsofultra-highSMFs,whichare
necessaryforthefutureapplicationofultra-highfieldMRImachinesonhumans.In
recentfewyears,therearemultiplestudiesthatwereperformedonthispurpose.For
example,in2021,Wangetal.reportedastudytoaddresstheeffectsof28-daylong-

overall good biosafety on except for some moderate liver impairment (Tian et al.
2018).Thenwereducedtheexposuretimeto1–2handusedhealthyC57BL/6mice
for our next few studies. We found that 3.5–23.0 T SMF exposure for 2 h did not
showobviousharmfuleffectsonhealthymice,includingfoodandwaterconsump-
tion, blood glucose levels, blood routine, blood biochemistry, as well as organ
weight and HE stains (Tian et al. 2019). In a later study, we further increased the
fieldto33.0Tandreducedtheexposuretimeto1h,whichisclosertotheclinical
MRI exposure time, and did not show significant changes for most physiological
indicatorsinthehealthyC57BL/6mice(Tianetal.2021).Inaddition,behaviortests
were also performed to examine the potential neurological effects of 3.5–33.0 T
SMFtreatmentfor1–2honhealthyC57BL/6mice.Surprisingly,wefoundthatthis
high-field SMF treatment could improve the mental state and spatial memory of
these mice (Lv et al. 2022; Khan et al. 2022), which was further confirmed by
physiologicalandbehaviortestswithCUS(chronicunpredictablestress)depression
mice that were treated with 7 T SMF for 8 h (Lv et al. 2022). These preliminary
studiesnotonlyprovideusefulsafetyinformationforthedevelopmentofultra-high
MRI, but may also indicate that high SMFs have the potential to be developed as
anti-depressiontreatmentmodalitiesinthefuture.
It should be noted that although current MRI machines in the hospitals are
considered to be safe, the long-term consequences of repeated exposure and their
potential beneficial effects on human bodies are still incomplete identified. In
addition, obvious advantages of ultra-high field MRI machines encourage people
to design ultra-high MRIs for technical benefits. This also calls for attention for
necessarystudiesfortheaccompaniedsafetyissues.Moreeffortsareneededtohelp
establish guidelines for occupational staff and patient exposures to higher
fieldSMFs.
8.4.2 Magnetic Surgery

minimally invasive surgery choice that benefits various procedures (Diaz et al.
2019). Doctors in the field of magnetic surgery have reached some consensus,
aiming to reduce surgical trauma, improve the exposure of the surgical field and
thesurgicaloperability(Lvetal.2019;Baietal.2022).
For now, most magnetic surgery can also be called as magnet-assisted surgery,
which uses permanent magnets to perform minimally invasive surgery (Fig. 8.3).

bracelets that received good reviews usually have their magnetic flux densities
clearly labeled and most of them are within the range of hundreds to thousands of
gausses(0.01–1T).
Despite the fact that magnetic therapy has a long history, it is still not well
accepted by the mainstream medicine. In some cases, it is even considered to be
pseudoscience.The doubts aremainlydue to thelack of consistency and scientific
explanations (as discussed in Chap. 1). There are many efforts that have been
devotedtotryingtoresolvethisissueandsomeofthemdidprovidepositiveresults.
Forexample,in1997,Vallbonaetal.conductedawell-controlledstudyon50post-
polio patients and found that the 300–500 Gauss (0.03–0.05 T) SMFs (active
magnetic device) significantly reduced the patient pain level from 9.6 to 4.4
(p < 0.0001) on a 10-point scale (Vallbona et al. 1997) (Table 8.3, top). It is
interesting that the sham-exposure system that maximally mimics the magnetic
device (inactive device) also had some placebo effects and reduced the patient
pain level from 9.5 to 8.4. However, it is obvious that the pain level change in the
SMF-treated group is fivefold more efficient than the placebo-device group
(5.2 vs. 1.1, p < 0.0001). In addition, 76% of the patients in the active magnetic
devicegroupreportedmuchreducedpainwhiletheplacebo-devicegrouponlyhave
19% patient (Vallbona et al. 1997) (Table 8.3, bottom). This study was done with
propercontrols,whichprovidedpeoplewithconvincedevidencesthatSMFscould

controlled, 6-month trial conducted from 1997 through 1998 on people with

fibromyalgia (Alfano et al. 2001). In addition to sham controls, they compared a
group of people that were exposed to sleep pads with magnets that provided low
uniformSMFofnegativepolarity(FunctionalPadA)withagroupexposedtosleep
pads with magnetsthat variedboth spatially and inpolarity (Functional PadB). In
fact,theydidfindthattheFunctionalPadAhadthemostsignificanteffectsandboth
Functional Pad A and B groups showed improvements in functional status, pain
intensity level, tender point count, and tender point intensity after 6 months of
treatment, but they did not differ significantly from changes in the control groups
(Alfanoetal.2001).Therefore,althoughthisstudyshowedthatthemagneticsleep
padshadthepotentialtowork,theeffectswerenotstatisticallysignificant.Ithinkthe
major reason for the lack of efficiency in their study might be the magnetic field
strength, which is too low (below 1 mT). Increasing the magnetic field strength to
hundredtothousandgaussmightwork.However,scientificstudiesareneededtobe
done to prove this. Moreover, in 2014, Juhász et al. did a randomized, self- and
placebo-controlled, double-blind, pilot study included 16 patients diagnosed with
erosivegastritis.TheyusedinhomogeneousSMF-exposureinterventionatthelower
sternalregionoverthestomachwithpeak-to-peakmagneticinductionof3mTand
30mT/mgradientatthetargetsite.Theydidfindclinicallyandstatisticallysignif-
icant beneficial effect of the SMF- over sham-exposure on the erosive gastritis
symptoms. The average effect of inhibition was 56% (p = 0.001). This indicates
thatinhomogeneousSMFcouldbeapotentialalternativeorcomplementarymethod
for erosive gastritis (Juhasz et al. 2014). It is interesting that their magnetic field
intensityseemsmuchlowerthanmostotherstudiesthathavepositiveresults.
Current evidences show that magnetic field strength is a key issue for potential
magnetic therapy applications. Overall, it is believed that magnetic fields with too
weak strength arenotenoughtoproduce enoughenergy.Asmentioned above,the
permanentmagnetsmostpeopleusedformagnetictherapyhavebeenprovedtobe
effective ranging from hundreds to thousands of gausses. For example, in 2002,
Brownetal.showedthat0.05TSMFfor4weekscouldreducechronicpelvicpain
in patients (Brown et al. 2002). In 2011, Kovacs-Balint et al. did a research on
15 young healthy human volunteers and found that an inhomogeneous 0.33 T
(Bmax)SMFexposurefor30mincouldincreasethethermalpainthreshold(TPT)
(Kovacs-Balint et al. 2011). However, it is possible, and very likely, that different
symptoms have different requirements for the magnetic field intensity, as well as
othermagneticfieldparameters.
Forexample,Richmondetal.comparedamagneticwriststrapwith(1502–2365
gauss), a demagnetized (<20 gauss) wrist strap, an attenuated (250–350 gauss)
magnetic wrist strap, and a copper bracelet. Their results show that wearing a
magnetic wrist strap or a copper bracelet did not appear to have any meaningful
therapeuticeffect,beyondthatofaplacebo,foralleviatingsymptomsandcombating
diseaseactivityinrheumatoidarthritis(Richmondetal.2013).Fornow,wearenot
sure about the reason for this lack of efficacy, however, as mentioned in Chap. 1,
magneticfieldparametersandmultipleotherfactorshaveledtothelargevariations
in the clinical or research work about the SMFs. For example, although lacking
scientific mechanistic foundations so far, it is interesting that there are multiple

do not exclude the possibility that these claims, or at least some of them, might be true. More

claims about the differential effects of the two different magnetic poles on human
bodies(Table8.4).Infact,therearetworecentpapersobserveddifferentialeffectsof
differentmagneticfielddirections(DeLukaetal.2016;Milovanovichetal.2016).
Although more research is strongly needed to confirm their results, I think people
should pay attention to the magnetic poles or directions when they investigate the
biological effects of magnet fields in the laboratory, or simply want to try some
magnetictherapyproducts.
Thedifferentialeffectsofthemagneticfielddirectionandnorth/southpolesneed

is possible that some unknown mechanism indeed exists to explain these observa-
tions. Moreover, since it has already been shown that magnet could levitate single
cellswhenthemagneticfieldisupwardtobalancethegravity(Durmusetal.2015),
it makes more sense to me if it is the magnetic field direction that makes the
differences that people observed. More interestingly, Durmus et al. demonstrated
that each cell type (i.e., cancer, blood, bacteria, and yeast) has a characteristic
levitation profile, and they have identified unique differences in levitation and
density blueprints between breast, esophageal, colorectal, and non-small cell lung
cancer celllines,aswellasheterogeneitywithinthese seeminglyhomogenouscell

neededtoconfirmthis.
8.5 Discussion
Itisworthtomentionthatcurrentlymanyresearchesrelatedtomagnetictherapyas
wellasthebiological effect studiesaboutmagneticfieldsarenotwelldescribedor
properly controlled. In 2008 and 2009, Colbert et al. wrote two important and
comprehensive reviews (Colbert et al. 2008, 2009), which stated that “Complete
descriptions of the SMF dose that was applied to human participants are notably
lackinginthemajorityofSMFtherapystudiespublishedtodate.Withoutknowing
the SMF dose that was delivered to the target tissue, we cannot draw meaningful
inferences from clinical trial results. As research on SMF therapy progresses,
engineers, physicists and clinicians need to continue to work together to optimize
SMFdosageandtreatmentparametersforeachclinicalcondition.Futurepublica-
tion of SMF studies should include an explicit assessment of the SMF dosage and
treatmentparametersoutlinedinthisreview,soastobeabletoreplicateprevious

sions, poleconfiguration, magnetic fluxdensity,frequency ofapplication, duration
ofapplication,siteofapplication,magnetsupportdevice,targettissue,distancefrom
magnet surface, which all have great potential to directly affect the outcomes

delivers low-intensity, intermediate-frequency (100–300 kHz), alternating electric
fields to treat newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma, which works by
disrupting cancer cell division, with no significant damage to normal non-dividing
cells (Kirson et al. 2004; Pless and Weinberg 2011; Davies et al. 2013). Although
TTF is a type of electromagnetic field therapy using low-intensity electrical fields,
not SMFs, it may shed light on the SMF investigations for their potential clinical
usage.
8.6 Conclusion
Since human body itself is an electromagnetic object, it is not surprising that the
magnetic fields can produce some effects on us. However, the electrochemical
processes within the human bodies are very complicated and still remain incom-
pletely understood. Therefore, the actual physical effects of magnetic fields on
humanbodieswillstillneedcontinuouseffortstoachieveacompleteunderstanding.
Inthemeantime,magnetictherapymaybeanalternativeorcomplementarymethod
in the clinical use, especially in cases when conventional therapy options are
unavailable. In addition, whether the magnetic therapy works does not depend on
ourunderstandingforitsunderlyingbiologicalmechanisms.AsDr.Basfordsaidin
hisreview(Basford2001)“Anelectricormagnetictherapyisfirstdiscoveredbythe
populace,resistedbythemedicalestablishment,andthendiscarded—onlytoarise
again in the future in a slightly different form. Although sophistication has
increased, this pattern is likely to continue into the future until clear treatment
benefits and, one hopes, a convincing mechanism of action are established.”
Currently,what we should doistotry ourbest tounravel themysteriesso thatwe
canmaximizethebenefitwecangetfromthesenaturepowers.Inthemeantime,we
should alert people that there are numerous unreliable websites or products about
magnetic therapy. We believe that with the increasing efforts to use legitimate and
scientifically backed methods in the field of magnetic field research, we will gain
more mechanistic insights to facilitate the clinical application of SMFs and make
magnetictherapyscientificallyrespectable.

alternativetreatmentonmultiplechronicdiseasesforyears,thescientificfoundation
is still lacking. As we have introduced in previous chapters, many studies have
investigatedthebiologicaleffectsofstaticmagneticfields(SMFs),withresultsthat
depended on multiple factors including SMF parameters, biological sample and
experimental procedure differences. In particular, thedifference in cell types made
a significant impact. A large number of reports show that cancer cells and some
specific cell types, including stem cells, embryonic or neuronal cells, are more
susceptibletoSMFs,whilemostothernon-cancercellsaremuchlessaffected.
HerewewouldliketofocusontheimpactsofSMFsoncancer.Itiswellknown
that cancer cells are different from normal cells in various aspects. For example,
multiple types of cancers proliferate in response to signalling from oncoproteins
suchasEGFR(epidermalgrowthfactorreceptor)andwefoundthatSMFcanaffect
EGFR orientation toreduce its activity as well asrelatedpathwaysto inhibit some
cancercellproliferation(Zhangetal.2015,2016).Moreover,mostcancercellsare
at a more active dividing state compared to normal cells. We found that moderate
and strong SMFs can interfere with microtubules so that the cell division can be
affected(Zhangetal.2017a).Themetastaticbehavioursandstemnessofcancercells
arealsodrasticallydifferentfromnon-cancercells.Werecentlyfoundthatmoderate
SMF could inhibit ovarian cancer cell migration, invasion and stemness, while
having a negligible effect on the non-cancer ovarian cells (Song et al. 2021).
However, Zhao et al. reported that the osteosarcoma stem cells metastasis in mice
waspromotedbymoderateSMFsoftiltedandgradientdirection(Zhaoetal.2021).
Inaddition,thecancermicrocirculation/angiogenesisandimmuneresponsesinvivo
arealsodifferentfromnormaltissues.HereIsummarizetheSMFseffectsoncancer
inmicestudies(Table9.1),whichindicatesthathigherfieldSMF,longertreatment
time,andverticallyupwarddirectionseemtobepositivelycorrelatedwiththeanti-
cancer efficacy. For example, Zhu et al. found that 0.6 T SMF treatment for
2–3 months efficiently inhibited cancer growth in transgenic polyoma middle T
oncoprotein(PyMT)miceby~60–70%,but0.3Tdidnothavethiseffect(Zhuetal.
2020).OurgroupfoundthatforthesameSMFfluxdensity,theupwardSMFscould
inhibitcancergrowthinmicewhilethedownwardSMFscouldnot(Tianetal.2018;
Yangetal.2021).Moreover,fortheupwarddirection9.4TSMFtreatment,a200-h
treatment can inhibit cancer growth by 62.88% (Tian et al. 2022) while 88-h can
inhibitcancergrowthby44.7%(Yangetal.2021),althoughwedidnotcomparethe
sametypesofcancerside-by-side.
In this chapter, I will first introduce the studies about the direct SMF effects on
cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, including cancer cell proliferation, division,
migration and invasion, as well as stemness. Then from the in vivo point of view,
the contributions of SMF effect on microcirculation/angiogenesis and immune
regulation are also discussed, which is followed by the combination of SMFs with
othertreatments,includingchemodrugs,time-varyingmagneticfields,etc.

9.2 Direct Effects of Static Magnetic Fields on Cancer Cells
In Vitro and In Vivo
9.2.1 Static Magnetic Fields Could Inhibit Some Cancer Cell
Proliferation
As introduced in previous chapters, the exact cellular effects of SMFs on cells are
largely dependent on cell types so that there is no consensus effect of SMF on
variouskindsofcells.Forexample,Sullivanetal.examinedtheeffectof35–120mT
SMFsonfourdifferenttypesofcellsandfoundthattheeffectsvariedgreatlyamong
them (Sullivan et al. 2011). However, among different cell types, the cell growth/
proliferation inhibition effects of SMF on cancer cells are much more consistent
comparedtoothercelltypes.
Multiple studies have shown that SMFs could inhibit cancer cell growth while
havingaminimaleffectonnon-cancercells.Althoughineachindividualstudy,the
cell types examined were very limited, we can see a clear trend that SMFs tend to
inhibit cancer cells but not non-cancer cells. For example, in 1996, Rayman et al.
showed that cell growth of a few cancer cell lines could be inhibited by 7 T SMF
(Raylmanetal.1996).Later,afewstudiesusedbothcancerandnon-cancercellsand
foundthattheyrespondtotheSMFsdifferentially.Forexample,in2003,Aldinucci
et al. found that 4.75 T SMF did not affect human peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC) but inhibited Jurkat leukemia cell proliferation (Aldinucci et al.
2003b). In 2006, Ghibelli et al. showed that 1 T SMF could increase the
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in human tumor U937 monocytes but not mono-
nuclear white blood cells (Ghibelli et al. 2006). In 2011, Tatarov et al. tested the
effectof100mTSMFonmicebearingmetastaticmousebreasttumorEpH4-MEK-
Bcl2cells.Theyfoundthatexposureofthemicetomagneticfieldsfor3or6h,but
not1h,dailyforaslongas4weekssuppressedtumorgrowth(Tatarovetal.2011).
Their study not only indicated that the moderate SMF could inhibit mouse breast
cancergrowth,butalsoshowedthattheinhibitionwasdirectlycorrelatedtotheSMF
exposuretime(Tatarovetal.2011).In2015,Zafarietal.investigatedtheeffectsof
SMF(5,10,20and30mT)for24–96hontheviabilityofthehumancervicalcancer
HeLa cells and fibroblast cells. They found that the increase of SMF intensity and
incubationtimeincreasedcelldeathpercentandproliferationrateinHeLacellsmore
obviouslycomparedtofibroblastcells(Zafarietal.2015).
Therearesomemechanisticstudiesthathaveexploredthedifferentialeffectsof
SMFsoncancervs.non-cancercellproliferation.Forexample,manytypesofcancer
cells proliferate inresponse tosignalling from Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs),
and the effect of magnetic fields (MFs) on EGFR phosphorylation has been inves-
tigatedinseveralstudies(Jiaetal.2007;Sunetal.2008,2013).Itwasshownthat
both 0.4 mT 50 Hz low frequency and 2 μT 1.8 GHz radiofrequency time-varying
MFs increased EGFR phosphorylation. However, it was very interesting that this
effect could be reversed by incoherent (“noise”) MFs of the same MF intensities
(Sunetal.2008,2013).TheseresultsnotonlydemonstratethatEGFRisamolecular

As mentioned above, most studies have only tested one or very few cell types,
whichpreventedpeoplefromgettingacomprehensiveviewofthecellulareffectsof
SMF on different kinds of cells. Therefore, our group side-by-side compared
15 different cell lines, including 12 human (7 cancer cell lines and 5 non-cancer
cell lines) and 3 rodent cell lines for their responses to 1 T inhomogeneous SMF
providedbyapermanentmagnet.WefoundthatSMFnotonlyaffectcellprolifer-
ation in a cell type-dependent manner, the cell density also played indispensable
roles(Table9.2)(Zhangetal.2017b).Forexample,thegrowthofA549lungcancer
cells was inhibited by 1 T SMF when they were seeded at a high density but the
growthofnormallungcellswaspromoted(Table9.2).
We further analysed their EGFR-mTOR-Akt pathway and found that the A549
lung cancer and HSAEC2-KT non-cancer lung cells have dramatically different
EGFR-mTOR-Akt pathway expression and activation (Fig. 9.2) (Zhang et al.
2017b). The EGFR expression and phosphorylation levels are much higher in
A549 lung cancer cells than in HSAEC2-KT normal lung cells. The mTOR and
AKT expression and phosphorylation levels are also significantly higher in A549

lungcancercells.Theseresults,combinedwiththeEGFRstudiesmentionedabove,
demonstrate that EGFR-mTOR-Akt pathway is likely to be one of the key factors
thatcontributetothecelltypedifferencesinSMF-inducedcellproliferationchanges.
Inaddition,itshouldbementionedthatthecelldensityalsoaffectedtheA549lung
cancer cells and normal lung cells HSAEC2-KT in different pattern (Fig. 9.2). For
example, the EGFR and 4EBP1 expression and phosphorylation level were
increasedinhighercelldensitycomparedtolowercelldensityinA549lungcancer
cells but not in HSAEC2-KT normal lung cells. These results indicate that EGFR-
mTOR-Aktpathwaymaybeakeyfactorthatcontributestobothcelltype-andcell
density-dependentSMFeffects.
Besides RTK pathway, the SMF effect on DNA synthesis is also an important
step in cell proliferation, which has been introduced in Chap. 6. Using BrdU
incorporation assay to measure DNA synthesis rates, we first found that 1 T mod-
erate SMF could inhibit DNA synthesis in colon cancer HCT116 and LoVo, and
lungcancerPC9andA549cells(Yangetal.2020),but0.5TSMFhasnoeffectson
DNA synthesis (Yang et al. 2021). Then we used higher field SMF provided by a
superconductingmagnet,andfoundthatDNAsynthesiswassignificantlydecreased
by both upward (14.3%, p < 0.01) and downward (18.6%, p < 0.01) 9.4 T SMFs
after 24 h (Fig. 9.3a). We also used Western blot analysis to examine the level of
TOP2α (DNA topoisomerase II Alpha), which functions to bring the higher order
compaction of chromatin to form condensed mitotic chromosomes during G2-M
transition. Our results show that TOP2α was decreased in both upward and down-
ward9.4TSMF-treatedcells(Fig.9.3b).TheDNAsynthesisinhibitionbySMFsis
likely due to the DNA supercoil changes through Lorenz forces on the negatively
charged DNA in motion. More specifically, we have previously proposed that the

upward SMF could cause tightened DNA supercoils while the downward SMF
causesloosensupercoils(Yangetal.2020).Interestingly,wefoundthattheupward
9.4TSMFsignificantlyincreasedreactiveoxygenspecies(ROS)level(Fig.9.3c),
whilethedownward9.4TSMFdidnot(Fig.9.3c).ItiswellknownthatROSplay
centralrolesinmultiplecellularprocesses,includingtriggeringP53activation,akey
tumorsuppressor.Infact,ourdatashowedthattheupward9.4TSMFcouldactivate
and upregulate P53 (Fig. 9.3d), but the downward 9.4 T SMF had no such effect
(Fig. 9.3e), which is consistent with the ROS level changes. It is possible that the
tightened DNA supercoils caused by Lorenz forces in upward 9.4 T SMF is a key
steptoboostROSlevel,whichconsequentlyactivatesP53andfurtherinhibitsDNA
replicationandcellproliferation.
Tofurtherconfirmtheresultswegotinvitro,weexaminedthetumortissuesof
the mice treated with or without 9.4 T SMF for the tumor suppressor P53 and the
proliferation marker Ki-67. It is obvious that the P53 level was significantly
increased by the upward 9.4 T SMF, but not downward 9.4 T SMF (Fig. 9.4a, b).
Moreover,theKi-67levelwassignificantlydecreasedbytheupward9.4TSMF,but
notmuchbythedownward9.4TSMF.Theseareconsistentwithourfindingsthat
9.4 T upward SMF could inhibit A549 lung cancer cell growth both in vitro and
in vivo. Therefore, although both the upward and downward 9.4 T SMF could
inhibit DNAsynthesisinvitro,onlytheupward9.4TSMFsignificantlyincreased
ROS and P53 levels, decreased mitotic index and caused G2 cell arrest, which

However, it should be mentioned that there are also a few studies showing that
SMFs could promote cancer cell proliferation. For example, we previously found
thatmoderateSMFscaninhibitcancercellproliferationwhentheyareplatedathigh
density,butcanalsoincreasesomecancercellnumberswhentheyareplatedatlow
density (Table 9.2) (Zhang et al. 2017b). It is a pity that we were not aware of the
importance in SMF direction in this study at that time, so the SMF direction
informationwasmissing.Inaddition,Fanetal.showthat~150mTSMFtreatment
accelerated 4 T1 breast cancer cell proliferation. However, they also showed that
SMF treatment shortened the telomere length, decreased telomerase activity, and
inhibitedtheexpression ofthecancer-specificmarkertelomerase reversetranscrip-
tase (TERT) (Fan et al. 2020). However, the SMF direction and cell density
informationarebothmissing,sowecannotexcludethepossibilityofthedirection-

non-cancer cells can recover after the cells were taken out of SMFs. However, the

9.2.3 Static Magnetic Fields and Cancer Metastasis
Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer patient death, which involves cancer cell
migrationandinvasionandisregulatedbymultiplefactors.Asfarasweknow,there
are only three studies that have investigated on the SMF effects on cancer cell
migration/invasion and/or cancer metastasis. In 2020, Fan et al. reported that a
moderate SMF of ~150 mT can inhibit 4 T1 breast cancer cell migration (Fan
et al. 2020), but they did not perform animal experiments. In 2021, our group
foundthatgradientmoderateSMFs(~0.5T)providedbyasuperconductingmagnet
orpermanentmagnetcanincreaseROSlevelandinhibitovariancancercellmigra-
tion, invasion (Fig. 9.6), and inhibit ovarian cancer metastasis in mice (Fig. 9.7)
(Song et al. 2021). However, also in 2021, using a titled direction gradient SMF
providedbyasuperconductingmagnet(Fig.9.8),Shang’sgroupreportedametas-
tasispromotingeffectsonosteosarcoma(Zhaoetal.2021).
9.2.4 Static Magnetic Fields and Cancer Cell Stemness
TherehavebeenmultiplestudiesthathaveinvestigatedtheeffectsofSMFsonstem
cells,suchasdentalpulpstemcells(DPSCs),bonemarrowstromalcells(BMSCs),
human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs), etc., which have been introduced in
Chap.6ofthisbook,andinsomereviews(Sadrietal.2017;Maryczetal.2018;Ho
etal.2019).However,theeffectofSMFsoncancercellstemnesswasnotreported
untilrecently,whichreportedoppositeeffectsofmoderateSMFoncancerstemness
andmetastasis(Songetal.2021;Zhaoetal.2021).
The report from our group using vertically upward direction SMFs of ~0.5 T
providedbyeitherapermanentmagnet,orasuperconductingmagnet(Figs.9.6aand
9.7), showed that these SMFs can increase ROS levels in ovarian cancer cells and
inhibited their stemness and metastasis (Song et al. 2021). It is known that ROS
couldaffecttheepithelial-mesenchymaltransition(EMT),promotethetransitionof
mesenchymal cancer stem cells (CSCs) into epithelial CSCs and then bulk cells
(Fig.9.9a).WeexposedSKOV3cellstoinhomogeneousmoderateSMFsprovided
bypermanentmagnets(0.1–0.5T)for24handusedreal-timePCRtofindoutthat
the stemness-related genes were significantly downregulated by SMF treatment,
including SRY-box transcription factor 2 (Sox2), Nanog, cell myc proto-oncogene
protein (C-myc), hyaluronan receptor (CD44), and CD133 (Fig. 9.9b). Moreover,

(Fig. 9.9d) (Song et al. 2021). These data suggested that ovarian cancer stemness
wassignificantlyreducedbythismoderateSMFtreatment.
Incontrast, another study from the Shang’sgroup reportedthat a tilted gradient
SMF provided by a superconducting magnet can also increase the ROS levels in
osteosarcoma stem cell, but promoted their stemness (Zhao et al. 2021). It is
interesting that two independent studies both performed cellular and animalexper-
imentsaboutmoderateSMFsoncancercellstemness,butgotoppositeeffects.There
are multiple possible reasons: (1) They used different cell lines, Song et al. used
SKOV3andHO8910ovariancancercellswhileZhaoetal.usedosteosarcomastem
cells.ThecellsinthebonesystemareverysusceptibletoSMFtreatment,whichwill
be discussed in Chap. 11. The magnetic directions were different. Song et al. used
verticallyupwardSMFswhile Zhao etal.used atilted SMF.Althoughthemecha-
nisms for SMF direction-induced bioeffects are still unclear, the differences have
been extensivelydiscussed previously discussed inChap.2. Obviously,we cannot
get any conclusions about SMF and their effects on cancer cell stemness yet at
this time point. However, given the importance of cancer stem cells in cancer
development, people should perform more studies to geta better understanding on
thistopic.

evaluated the effects of prolonged exposure to SMFs on tumor angiogenesis and
growth. They found that 586 mT SMF exposure for 3 h could inhibit both tumor
angiogenesisandgrowth(Strelczyketal.2009).Detailedanalysisrevealedthatthe

indicated that SMFs might increase tumor microvessel leakiness. In 2014, their
group did some further analysis and found that the 587 mT SMF did increase the
tumor microvessel permeability significantly in A-Mel-3-tumor-bearing hamsters
(Gellrich et al. 2014) (Fig. 9.10). It was interesting but not surprising that the
functional tumor microvessels, labeled by FITC-dextran, were much decreased
after SMF exposure,especially after therepeated SMF exposure,which was likely
duetotheinhibitedtumorangiogenesis.Nevertheless,itwasobviousthatbothSMF
singleexposureandrepeatedexposureincreasedthebloodvesselleakinessandthe
repeatedSMFexposurehadstrongereffects.Inaddition,theauthorsproposethatthe
increased microvessel permeability was likely the reason for the improved anti-
tumor efficacy of SMFs in combination with paclitaxel (Fig. 9.10) (Gellrich et al.
2014).
AnindependentgroupalsoreportedtheeffectsofSMFonangiogenesis.In2009,
Wang et al. investigated the effects of the gradient SMF (0.2–0.4 T, 2.09 T/m,
exposuretime1–11days)onangiogenesisinthehumanumbilicalveinsendothelial
cells (HUVECs) as well as two in vivo models, a chick chorioallantoic membrane
(CAM) and a Matrigel plug (Wang et al. 2009). Their results showed that the
HUVECs proliferation was significantly inhibited after 24-h exposure. In addition,
the two in vivo models both showed decreased angiogenesis after 7 or 11 days of
exposure (Wang et al. 2009). Although this study was not carried out in a tumor-
related model, it showed the inhibition effect of moderate SMFs on angiogenesis,
which was consistent with the results reported by Strieth and co-workers (Strieth
et al. 2008; Strelczyk et al. 2009). Moreover, our group analyzed the lung cancer

MFsregulatingimmunesystemtoinhibitcancer.However,althoughseveralstudies
have shown that SMFs can affect immune systems, which are summarized in
Chap. 12of thisbook, there arecurrently onlytwostudiesthat haveaddressedthe
effectofSMFonimmunesystemandtheirregulationoncancer(Linetal.2019;Zhu
etal.2020).
In 2020, Zhu et al. reported a comprehensive study showing that exposure to
moderateSMFs(Maxmagneticfluxdensityatthesurfaceofthemagneticcubesisat

9.5 Static Magnetic Fields in Combination with Other
Treatments
9.5.1 Static Magnetic Fields in Combination
with Chemodrugs
There are a large number of researches studied the combinational effects of SMF
with chemotherapy drugs, and most of them used moderate SMFs (Table 9.3).
Multiple studies have achieved enhanced anti-tumor efficacy compared to SMF or
chemodrugsalone.Forexample,in2014,Gellrichetal.foundthata587mTSMF
couldsignificantlyincreasetheanti-tumorefficiencyofpaclitaxelchemotherapyin
A-Mel-3-tumor-bearinghamsters becausethe587mTSMFinhibitedtumorangio-
genesis and inceased tumor microvessel permeability significantly (Gellrich et al.
2014). Our group also found that 1 T moderate intensity SMF could increase the
antitumorefficacyofmTORinhibitors,EGFRinhibitors,Aktinhibitors,aswellas
Taxoland5-Fu(Zhangetal.2015;Luoetal.2016).Inaddition,chemotherapydrug

and transplanted mammary tumors in mice when it was combined with moderate
intensity SMFs of 110 mT or 8.8 mT, respectively (Gray et al. 2000; Hao et al.
2011).In2006,Ghibellietal.showedthat1TSMFincreasedapoptosisinducedby
anti-tumordrugsinhumantumorU937monocytesbutnotmononuclearwhiteblood
cells(Ghibellietal.2006).
ItwasproposedthatthecellmembranepermeabilitycanbeincreasedbySMFsto
allow more drugs to enter cells (Tofani et al. 2003; Liu et al. 2011; Gellrich et al.
2014).Thisisanappealingexplanationbecauseitcanexplainthecombinedeffects

chemotherapy drugs (Table 9.3), which indicates that the combinational effects of
SMFswithchemodrugsmaybedrug-specificand/orcelltype-specific.
However, it should be mentioned that the current experimental results about
combination of SMFs with Cisplatin are not completely consistent. Although we
andVergalloetal.foundthatSMFsdidnotincreasetheefficacyofCisplatin,there
arealsosomeotherevidencesshowingoppositeresults.Forexample,itwasshown

is probably due to the different magnetic intensities in independent studies or cell

effectsandmechanismsofcombiningSMFswithCisplatinindifferentcellsneedto
befurtherinvestigated.
Infact,therearesomestudiesindicatedthatbothMFintensityandcelltypecould
influencetheeffectofSMFincombinationwithdrugs.Forexample,in1999,Fanelli
etal.foundthatSMFswithdifferentintensitiesstartingfrom6gausscoulddecrease
the extent of cell death by apoptosis induced by several agents in different human
cell systems via modulation of Ca2+ influx, and this effect was MF intensity-
dependent (Fanelli et al. 1999). This directly showed that the MF intensity could
influencetheeffect ofSMFswith drugs.Forcelltype induceddifference, in2003,
Aldinuccietal.testedafewdifferentcelltypesfortheeffectsofcombininga4.75T
SMF and a pulsed EMF of 0.7 mT generated by an NMR apparatus for 1 h. They
foundthatinTcellleukemiaJurkatcellsthecalciumlevelwasreducedsignificantly
after exposure (Aldinucci et al. 2003b) but in normal or in PHA challenged lym-
phocytes the calcium level was increased (Aldinucci et al. 2003a). Moreover, in
2006, Ghibelli et al. compared two different MF intensities (1 T vs. 6 mT), four
different cell lines (two cancer cell lines, human leukemic monocyte lymphoma
U937 cells and T cell leukemia Jurkat cells as well as two types of normal cells,
humanmonocytesandlymphocytes)(Ghibellietal.2006).Itwasnotsurprisingthat
neither the 1 T nor the 6 mT SMF induced apoptosis in all four types of cells.
However, it is interesting that 1 T SMF increased puromycin (PMC)-induced
apoptosis in U937 cells, but not in other three cell types (Ghibelli et al. 2006). In
addition, unlike 1 T SMF, the 6 mT SMF did not increase the PMC-induced
apoptosis in any of the cells. In contrast, it reduced the PMC-induced apoptosis in
U937 cells (Ghibelli et al. 2006). Moreover, Tenuzzo et al. used 6 mT SMF and
apoptosis-inducing agents to compare their effects on multiple types of cells and
found that SMF interfered with apoptosis in a cell type- and exposure time-
dependent manner (Tenuzzo et al. 2006). In addition, we have reported that 1 T
SMF could increase the efficacy of some chemodrugs (5-Fu, Taxol) in multiple
humansolidcancercelllines,suchasbreastcancerMCF-7,coloncancerHCT116,
nasophagealcancerCNE-2Zcellsbutonlyatsomedrugconcentrations (Luoetal.
2016). Therefore, MF intensity, cell type, drug concentration, and even exposure
time,couldallinfluencethecombinationaleffectofSMFwithdrugs.
Moreover,althoughmoststudieshaveusedmoderateSMFs,werecentlyreported
that 9.4 T high-field SMF can also increase the efficacy of the chemotherapy drug
imatinibmesylate.Moreimportantly,italsoameliorateschemodrug-inducedtoxic-

bearing gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST-T1) cells. We found that the tumor
growth was inhibited up to 62.88% when treated with 9.4 TSMF alone for 200 h.
Moreimportantly,9.4TSMFcombinedwith20mg/kgimatinibmesylatecanresult
in 92.75% tumor suppression, which is close to the anti-tumor effect of high dose
(80 mg/kg) imatinib. However, 80 mg/kg imatinib caused severe side effects,
including significantly reduced gain of body weight, abnormal liver function and
depressivebehaviorsinmice.Incontrast,9.4TSMFtreatmentsignificantlyreduced
thesesideeffects,especiallyforthedepressivebehaviors.Thus,ourresultsdemon-
strate that 9.4 T SMF not only has anti-tumor effects on its own, but also could
improvetheanti-tumoreffectofimatinibmesylate,reduceitstoxicityandimprove
themicementalhealth,whichunraveledthegreatclinicalpotentialsofhighSMFin

Therefore,itisclearthatalthoughinmostcases,SMFscouldincreasetheefficacy
of chemodrugs, there are also some studies showed different results (Table 9.3).
Thesedifferentialeffectscouldbecausedbycelltype,fieldintensityaswellasdrug
differences, etc. Consequently, the strategy of combining SMFs of different inten-
sities with various chemodrugs in different cancer cells also needs to be further
investigated.
9.5.2 Static Magnetic Fields in Combination
with Time-Varying Magnetic Fields
TherearemultiplestudiesshowingthatSMFscombinedwithtime-varyingmagnetic
fields could inhibit cancer cell growth (Tofani 2015) (Table 9.4). For example,
Tofani et al. have made series progresses on the combination of SMF and 50 Hz
time-varying MF. In 2001, Tofani et al. showed that 3 mT SMF combined with
50Hz time varyingMF could induce more apoptosisincellscompared toSMFor

the50HztimevaryingMFalone(Tofanietal.2001).Inaddition,itwasinteresting
that apoptosis only occurred in the two transformed cell lines (WiDr human colon
adenocarcinoma and MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma) but not the
nontransformed cell line (MRC-5 embryonal lung fibroblast). They also tested
theminnudemicexenograftedwithWiDrcellsandexposedthemfor70min/day,
5days/week,to≤5mTSMFincombinationwithtime-varyingMFfor4weeksand
foundthatthetumorwassignificantlyinhibited(upto50%)(Tofanietal.2001).In
2002,theyfurthertestedtheeffectsof5.5mTSMFincombinationwith50Hztime
varying MF and found that the survival time of nude mice with WiDr cells was
increasedby31%whenthemicewasexposedtomagneticfieldsfor70min/dayfor
4weeks(Tofanietal.2002).Whenthemicewereexposedtothemagneticfieldsfor
4 consecutive weeks, significant inhibition of tumor growth (40%) together with a
decrement in tumor cell mitotic index and proliferative activity were observed. In
addition,theyalsofoundasignificantincreaseinapoptosistogetherwithareduction
in immunoreactive p53 expression (Tofani et al. 2002). These works indicate that
SMF+50Hztime-varyingMFofabove3mTmayhaveanti-cancer potentials.In
contrast, lower MF intensity, such as 1 mT SMF did not induce cell apoptosis as
3, 10 or 30 mT SMFs did (Tofani et al. 2001). Actually, their results could
potentially explain why Bodega et al. did not observe any changes when they
exposed cultured astroglial cells to a combined 1 mT SMF with sinusoidal 50 Hz
time-varying MF for 11 days (Bodega et al. 2005), which might due to the low
magneticfieldstrength.
Toourknowledge,allreportedstudiesusedthecombinationofmilli-TeslaSMFs
(1–10 mT) with 50 Hz time-varying MF of similar MF intensity (Table 9.4). The
combinationeffectsofSMFs with higher magneticfieldintensity and/or incombi-
nation with time-varying MFs of other frequencies besides 50 Hz have not been
reported. Whether the currently reported cancer inhibition effects of milli-Tesla
SMFs with 50 Hz time-varying MF can also be applied to other magnetic field
parameters,suchasdifferentmagneticfieldintensityorfrequency,isstillunknown.
Inaddition,sincethethreecelllinesTofanietal.testedshoweddifferentresponses
to the combinational treatment of SMF+ time-varying MF (increased apoptosis in
two cancer cells lines WiDr and MCF-7 but not non-cancer cell line MRC-5), it is
likely that theeffects arealso cell type-dependent.Whether other cancer cell types
canalsobeinhibitedbySMF+time-varyingMFstillneedmoreinvestigations.
9.5.3 Static Magnetic Fields in Combination
with Radiotherapy
Radiationtherapy(radiotherapy)iscommonlyusedincancertreatment.Ituseshigh-
energy radiation to kill cancer cells and reduce tumor size. Currently, the most
commonly used types of radiation are X-rays. In some cases, gamma rays and
charged particles are also used for cancer treatment. In recent years, image-guided

9 PotentialApplicationsofStaticMagneticFieldsinCancerTreatment 289
radiotherapy(IGRT)hasgreatlyimprovedtheprecisionandaccuracy ofradiother-
apy,whichtakesadvantageofmodernimagingtechniquessuchasultrasound,X-ray
and CT (computed tomography) scan. The information provided by these imaging
techniquesbeforeandduringradiotherapytreatmentnotonlyshowsthesize,shape
and position of thetumoritself, the surrounding tissues and bones, butalso allows
instant correction for positioning deviations and thereby improves the precision of
daily radiotherapy fractions. Although CT scan is mostly used in current IGRT,
MRI-guided radiotherapy is attracting increasing attention. It is well known that
MRI gives superior soft tissue contrast and more importantly, MRI could offer the
advantageofprovidingIGRTwithoutdeliveringanadditionalradiationdosetothe
patientscomparedtoCTorX-rayimaging.Currently,multiplegroupsarebuilding
orstartingtotestMRI-guidedradiotherapy.
AlongwiththeintroductionofMRI-guidedradiotherapy,thepotentialeffectsof
SMFs on ionizing radiation have become increasingly important. However, the
accompanied lab studies about the combinational effects of SMF and radiation is
lacking. Although there are some evidences showing that the effects of ionizing
radiation on cells could be strengthened by Time-varying MFs, such as 50 Hz
magnetic fields (Francisco et al. 2013), the studies about SMFs in combination
with radiotherapy are much less. So far there are only a few studies that have
investigated the combinational effects of SMFs with ionizing radiation and most
of these studies indicated that SMFs might be able to increase the effectiveness of
radiotherapy(Table9.5).Forexample,in2002,Nakaharafoundthatalthough10T
SMFitselfhadnoeffectonCHO-K1cellgrowth,cellcycledistribution,ormicro-
nucleus frequency, they could cause an increase in the micronucleus formation
induced by 4 Gy X-rays (Nakahara et al. 2002). In 2010, Sarvestani et al. investi-
gated the effects of a 15 mT SMF alone for 5 h or 0.5 Gy X-ray +15 mT SMF
sequentialexposures(firstX-rayandthenSMFfor5h)oncellcycleprogressionin
rat bone marrow stem cells (BMSC). They did not find any cell cycle changes in
SMFalonetreatedcellsbutfoundthat15mTSMFexposurecouldfurtherincrease
theG2/Mcellpercentageinducedby0.5GyX-ray(Sarvestanietal.2010).In2014,
Teodori et al. investigated the genotoxic effect of 80 mT SMF, both alone and in
combination with X-ray irradiation, on primary glioblastoma cells. Their results
showed that exposure of cells to 5 Gy of X-ray irradiation alone led to extensive
DNAdamage,whichwassignificantlyreducedby80mTSMF(Teodorietal.2014).
TheDNAdamagepromotioneffectof10TSMFinCHO-K1cells(Nakaharaetal.

cytesfrommalealbinoWistarrats.Theirresultsindicatedthat5mTSMFincreased
the ROS changes induced by 3Gy X-ray radiation while “0m T” (50 μT magnetic
field induction opposite to the geomagnetic field) always showed opposite effects
compared to 5 mT SMF (Politanski et al. 2013). This indicated that different
magnetic field intensity could directly influence its effect on radiation-induced
effects.Moreresearchesareneededtogetacompleteunderstandingaboutdifferent

suchasgammaradiation,shouldalsobeinvestigated.
9.6 Patient Studies
It is interesting and promising that time-varying electromagnetic fields have been
showntobeeffectiveinmultiplestudiesatthepatientlevelandwereintroducedasa
novelcancertreatmentmodality.Themostfamousexamplewasthetumortreating
fields (TTF, or TTFields) therapy, which delivers low-intensity, intermediate-fre-
quency(100–300kHz),alternating electric fieldsthatcauseapoptosisorcelldeath
byinducingmitoticcatastropheandcaneffectivelyinhibitthegrowthofavarietyof
human and rodent tumor cell lines, with no significant damage to normal
non-dividing cells (Kirson et al. 2004; Pless and Weinberg 2011; Davies et al.
2013). In addition, Barbault et al. examined patients with various types of cancer
using a noninvasive biofeedback method to identify “tumor-specific frequencies”
(Barbault etal. 2009). They implied that cancer-related frequencies appeared to be
tumor-specific and treatment with tumor-specific frequencies was feasible, well
tolerated and may have biological efficacy in patients with advanced cancer
(Barbaultetal.2009).Recently,Kimetal.usedTTFtostudythemetastaticpotential
of U87 and U373 glioblastoma cell lines and found that TTF affected NF-κB,
MAPK and PI3K/AKT signalling pathways as well as downregulated VEGF,
HIF1α and matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9, which indicated that TTF could be
apromisingnovelanti-invasionandanti-angiogenesistherapeuticstrategyforglio-
blastomapatients(Kimetal.2016).Moreimportantly,studiesreportedthattreating
recurrentglioblastomapatientswithTTFimprovedoverallsurvival(OS)andthere
wasnounexpectedadverseeffects(DeBonisetal.2012;Rulsehetal.2012).Dueto
these clinical outcomes, TTF was approved by the FDA as an alternative to the
standardtreatmentforpatientswithrecurrentandnewlydiagnosedglioblastoma.
Incontrast,althoughalargenumberofinvitroandinvivostudiesindicatedthe
anticancerpotentialsofSMFs,thereisonlyaverysmallamountofdataconcerning
their application in clinical cancer treatment so far. In 2003, Salvatore et al. found
thatthere wasnoincreaseintheseverity ofchemotherapytoxicityasmeasuredby
white blood cell count and platelet count in the participants exposed to SMF
(Salvatoreetal.2003).In2004,Ronchettoetal.examined11patientswith“heavily
pretreated”advancedcancerinapilotstudywithdifferentSMFexposureandfound
that the magnetic fields can be safely administrated according to their exposure
schedules (Ronchetto et al. 2004). Although these studies indicated the safety of
SMFs at patient level, the effectiveness of these SMFs on cancer inhibition is still
lacking, which still needs to be proved. In fact, there are some clinical studies
reported in some Chinese journals about the successful application of SMFs on
some cancer treatments, which have been reviewed by Dr. Zhou, although also
written inChinese(Zhou2000).Inthesestudies,itseemsthatapplyingpermanent

of 420 r/min, 0.4 T magnetic fields on the survival and palliation of general
symptomsin13advancednon-smallcelllungcancer(NSCLC)patients(Sunetal.
2012a). The patients were treated for 2 h/day, 5 days/week for 6–10 weeks. While
themediansurvivaloftheadvancedNSCLCpatientsreceivingsupportivecarewas
4 months, their “spinning magnetic device” could prolong the median survival to
6 months, which was increased by 50%. Although 6 months median survival was
still shorter than that of patients receiving chemotherapy (Cisplatin, 9.1 months;
Carboplatin,8.4months),themagneticfield-treated patientshadnoseveretoxicity
or side-effects. More importantly, the 1-year survival rate was 31.7%, which was
muchhigherthanpatientsonlyreceivingsupportivecare(15%)andcomparableto
patients receiving chemotherapy (Cisplatin, 37%; Carboplatin, 34%). In the mean-
time, the magnetic fields treated patients had improved physical conditions and
alleviatedsymptomsingeneral(Sunetal.2012a).Infact,theeffectofthistypeof

9.7 Discussion
Themechanismsofthedifferentialresponsesofcancervs.non-cancercellstoSMFs
still remain partially understood. However, SMF-induced microtubule interference
isabroadimpactonmostdividingcells.Moreover,cancerandnon-cancercellshave
beenshowntoresponddifferentiallytocellcycleperturbations.Forexample,ithas

2009). Brito and Rieder found that both nocodazole and Taxol, two microtubule
poisons, could kill much more HeLa and U2OS cancer cells than the non-cancer
RPE1 cells. Specifically, 5 nM of Taxol, which is approximately the clinical
concentration for chemotherapy, could kill 93% of HeLa cells and 46% of U2OS
cellsbutonlykilled1%ofRPE1cells(BritoandRieder2009).Inaddition,different
types of cancer cells also have differential responses to microtubule drugs (Tang
et al. 2013). Moreover, the depletion of plk1 (polo-like kinase), which is a vital
regulatorinmultiplecellularprocesses,especiallyincellcycleprogression,caused
significant cell proliferation and cell cycle abnormalities in human cervical cancer
HeLacells,butnotthenon-cancerRPE1orMCF10Abreastcells(Liuetal.2006).
Therefore, targeting microtubules or cell cycle could generate different effects on
cancervs.non-cancercellsorindifferenttypesofcancercells.
Meanwhile, we should keep in mind that although EGFR and cell division are
important, they are definitely not the only reasons that can explain the differences
between SMF-induced differential effects among various cell types. Other factors
arealsolikelyinvolved.Forexample,Shortetal.showedthat4.7TSMFcouldalter
the ability of human malignant melanoma cells attachment onto the tissue culture
plate, but had no effect on normal human fibroblasts (Short et al. 1992), which
indicated that the cell attachment was differentially affected by SMF in
cancervs.non-cancercells.Moreover,otheraspectsshouldalsobecarefullyinves-
tigated, such as cell metabolism, mitochondria functions, ROS (reactive oxygen
species) responses and ATP level, which could all be affected differentially in
cancer vs. normal cells. Our group is currently working on these topics and we
expecttohaveamuchbetterunderstandingonthisissueinthenearfuture.
9.8 Conclusion
Cancerisaheterogeneousdiseaseanditscomplexityhashinderedthedevelopment
ofeffectiveandsafetreatments.Thestudieslistedinthischaptergreatlyhelpedusto
understandsomeofthemechanismsthatSMFsaffectcancercellsandtheirpotential
applications in cancer treatment in the future. We only discussed about membrane
receptor EGFR, cell division and microcirculation here, but it is likely that other
aspects are also involved in SMF-induced cancer inhibition, such as ion channels,
ROS,theimmunesystemaswellasmetabolism.Moreover,currentcellularstudies
and animal models of SMF effects on cancers are variable in reproducibility, and
further systematic studies of different treatment parameters would be definitely
beneficial.Inthemeantime,whilesomemechanismsofactionhavebeenproposed,
their substantiation is needed. Although more research should be conducted to
demonstrate its safety and efficacy, current experimental results indicate that SMF
is relatively safe. Understanding and exploiting the potential application of SMFs

Effects of Static Magnetic Fields on Diabetes

Abstract Diabetes, a metabolic chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia,
hasdireconsequencesforhealthandwell-beingifleftuncontrolled.Inrecentyears,
therearesomestudiesabouttheeffectsofstaticmagneticfields(SMFs)ondiabetes

multiple parameter SMFs on glycemia and insulin levels, as well as diabetic com-
plications. It is interesting that although the reported effects of SMFs on glycemia
and insulin levels are variable due to the differences in SMF parameters and
experimentalsubjects,SMFshaveconsistentlyshownbeneficialeffectsondiabetic
complications including wound healing. Mechanistic studies indicate that SMFs
may play an important role in insulin secretion by affecting membrane proteins,
hormone levels, and reactive oxygen species. This not only contributes to a better
understanding of SMF effects on diabetes and its complications, but also lays the
foundation for more systematic and in-depth studies to develop potential applica-
tionsofSMFsintheclinicalsettingofdiabetesinthefuture.

ofdiabetesmellitus,forexample,diabetesthatoccurduringpregnancy,ormediated
by drugs or chemicals, viral infections, etc. (Forbes and Cooper 2013; Magliano
et al. 2021). Among the various reasons for triggering diabetes, the main causes
include autoimmune destruction of pancreatic islet cells, insulin resistance, and
insufficientinsulinsecretion(AmericanDiabetesAssociation2010).Besideshyper-
glycemia,diabetescanalsocauseaseriesofcomplications,includingdysfunctions
inthekidney,retina,cardiovascularsystem,neurons,andliver,whicharethemajor
causes of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients (Morrish et al. 2001; Demir
etal.2021).
In recent years, there are multiple studies that have reported the effects of
magnetic fields on diabetes and its complications. For example, Carter et al.
performed multiple mice experiments to demonstrate that a combined static mag-
netic field (SMF) and static electric fieldcan effectively improve glycemia, insulin
resistance,andglucoseintoleranceinT2D(Carteretal.2020)(Fig.10.1).Ourgroup
compared four types of moderate SMFs, with different SMF flux, directions, and
distributions, and foundthat a ~100 mTvertically downward direction SMF could
effectivelyalleviatethedevelopmentofhyperglycemia,fattyliver,andweightgain

10.2 Effects of Static Magnetic Fields on Glycemia Levels
in Diabetic Animals
Currently, the effects of various SMFs on glycemia, the key indicator for diabetes
diagnosis, in diabetic model animals are still inconsistent (Table 10.1), which is
largelyduetotheSMFparameterdifferencesindifferentexperiments.Somestudies
havereportedthatSMFcanraiseglycemialevels.Forexample,Carteretal.reported
that3mThorizontalSMFexposurefor7h/dayforconsecutive25dayssignificantly
increasedglycemia(Carteretal.2020).Conversely,studieshavealsoreportedthat
SMF can decreased glycemia levels. Li et al. reported that alternating pole SMFs
(400 and 600 mT) exposure for 24 h can also induce glycemia reduction (Li et al.
2020).Inaddition,therearealsostudiesthatfoundnoeffect ofSMFonglycemia.
For example, our group found no statistically changes in glycemia levels in db/db
miceafterexposureto~15mTinhomogeneousSMF(Fengetal.2022).Zhangetal.

mice treated with ~100 mT upward direction SMF for consecutive 12 weeks
increased the glycemia level, while the downward SMF decreased glycemia
(Yuetal.2021).ThesedemonstratethatSMFparameter,especiallySMFdirection,
iscriticalfortheSMFeffectsonglycemia.
10.3 Effects of Static Magnetic Fields on Insulin Levels
in Diabetic Animals
Generally speaking, increased insulin levels usually correspond to the decreased
glycemia. However, it is not always the case because insulin resistance is another
important feature of diabetes, which results in reduced sensitivity of the body to
insulin.Asfarasweknow,thereareonlythreestudiesthathavereportedtheeffects
of SMFs on insulin levels in diabetic mice, and their results are also variable
(Table 10.2). However, Carter et al. found that although the combined static mag-
neticandelectricfieldsdecreasedinsulinsecretion,theystillcandecreaseglycemia
by increasing the insulin sensitivity in mice (Carter et al. 2020). Therefore, people
arerecommendedtoalsomeasuretheinsulinsensitivityintheirstudiestogetamore
comprehensive understanding of how SMFs affect the glucose metabolism. In our
study,wefoundthatthe~100mTdownwarddirectionSMFnotonlyincreasedthe
insulin levels, but also improved the insulin sensitivity in high-fat diet (HFD)/
streptozotocin(STZ)-inducedT2Dmice(Yuetal.2021).

10.4 Effects of Static Magnetic Fields on Diabetic
Complications
The hyperglycemia of diabetes produces glucotoxicity that cause damage to the
macrovasculature system (cardiovascular disease), microvasculature system (dia-
beticnephropathy,diabeticretinopathy,andneuropathy),andothertissues(diabetic
bone,diabeticfoot,anddiabeticencephalopathy),resultinginvariouscomplications
(Ceriello2005;ColeandFlorez2020).
Diabetessignificantlyimpairsboneformation,reducesthemechanicalstrengthof
bone,andultimatelyleadstoosteoporosis(Hofbaueretal.2022).Italsoaccelerates
the degeneration of skeletal structures (Rabe et al. 2021), makes diabetic patients
morepronetofractures(Janghorbanietal.2007;Wangetal.2019)anddifficultto
healafterfractures(RetzepiandDonos2010),whichmakethemortalityratedueto
fracturessignificantlyhigherthanthatofthenon-diabeticpopulation(Gulceliketal.
2011).In2018,Zhangetal.showedthata4mTSMFtreatment(2h/day,16weeks)
can improve bone stiffness, increase the expression of osteogenesis-related genes,
and improve symptoms associated with diabetic osteoarthropathy (Zhang et al.
2018).AlthoughitistheonlyreportsofarthathasinvestigatedontheSMFeffects

Moreover, it should be noted that at least 50% of diabetic patients suffer from
diabeticneuropathy,asetofclinicalsyndromescausedbydamagetotheperipheral
andautonomicnervoussystems,whichcausesallodynia,spontaneouspain,burning,
andnumbness(Feldmanetal.2019).Similartotheabove-mentionedeffectofSMFs
on bone, there are also many studies of SMFs on nervous system in non-diabetic
animals,whichwillbediscussedinChap.13ofthisbook.However,thereareonly
twostudiessofarthathaveinvestigatedtheeffectsofSMFsondiabeticneuropathy
and the results are still inconclusive. László et al.examined theSTZ-induced CD1
micetreatedwith2.8–476.7mTinhomogeneousSMFfor0.5h/dayfor6weeksand
foundnosignificanteffect(Lászlóetal.2011).However,Weintraubetal.foundthat
shoe insole of 45 mT alternating pole SMF (24 h/day, 4 months) can play a
mitigating role in patient feet with symptoms associated with diabetic neuropathy
(Weintraubetal.2003).
Lastly,itiswellknownthatoneofthemostprevalentcomplicationsindiabetic

10.5 Effects of Static Magnetic Fields on Glycemia
and Insulin Levels in Cells and Non-Diabetic Animals
Besides the studies of SMFs on diabetic animals, there are actually quite a few
studies performed on non-diabetic animals (Table 10.4). Similar to that of diabetic
animals, the results in non-diabetic animals are also inconsistent. However, it is
interesting that there are no studies reporting decreased glycemia levels in
non-diabetic animals so far. Gorczynska et al. found that blood glucose in Wistar
rats can be elevated by 1 mT and 10 mT SMFs (Gorczynska and Wegrzynowicz
1991). Meanwhile, several works by Lahbib et al. also found that 128 mT SMF
increasedglycemialevelsinWistarrats(Lahbibetal.2010,2015a,b).Inaddition,
some studieshave also shown noeffect ofSMF on glycemialevels. Currently,we
cannot make an accurate conclusion or explanation because of the differences in
micestrains,SMFparameters,andSMFtreatmentmethods.
Moreover, insulin levels were also investigated in many studies in cells and
non-diabetic mice (Table 10.5). We found that treatment of INS-1 cells with
400 mT SMF for more than 6 h can increase insulin expression and secretion
(Mao et al. 2015, 2017), and the exposure of INS-1 cells with 6 T SMF for 1 h
can also increase insulin secretion(Sakurai et al.2009).Interestingly, studyingthe
effectsofSMFsonisletcellsisolatedfromSprague-Dawleyrats,Hayeketal.found
thattheSMFincreasesinsulinlevelsinamagneticfluxdensity-dependentmannerat
magnetic flux density of 0.1–1 mT and lower initial glucose concentrations
(5.4 mmol/L) (Hayek et al. 1984). In contrast, these effects were not significant at
higher (16.7 mmol/L) initial glucose concentration conditions (Hayek et al. 1984).
Fromtheaboveresults,wespeculatethattheinfluenceofSMFsoninsulinisrelated
tothemagneticfluxdensity,exposuretime,andtheinitialglucoselevel.
10.6 Analysis of Inconsistent Effects of Static Magnetic
Fields on Glycemia or Insulin
It is obvious that SMFs have generated very variable effects on most aspects of
diabetes and complications, except for the diabetic wound healing. We think there
are multiple factors that contribute to these inconsistencies, which are discussed
below.
First of all, the major factor is the SMF parameters, including distributions
(direction and gradient, etc.) and flux densities generated by the different devices
(Fig.10.3),especiallytheSMFdirection.Ourgrouphaspreviouslyreportedonthe
SMF direction-induced differential bioeffects (Tian et al. 2018; Yang et al. 2020,
2021) and has also systematically summarized them in Chap. 2 of this book.
Moreover,wehaveside-by-sidecomparedfourdifferentSMFsettingsanddifferent

upwarddirectionSMF(Fig.10.3c)reducedbloodglucoselevels,whilethe~100mT
downward direction SMF (Fig. 10.3d) could reduce blood glucose. Furthermore,
most of studies showing elevated glycemia levels and reduced insulin levels in
non-diabetic animals have used a 128 mT SMF exposure system (Fig. 10.3g) by
theLakeShoreelectromagnetsdevicemanufacturedbyLakeShoreCryotronics,Inc.
(Tables10.4and10.5).Interestingly,thedirectionofSMFgeneratedbytheirdevice
isverticallyupward,whichreinforceourhypothesisthattheupwarddirectionSMF
has a tendency to increase glycemia. Moreover, the magnetic flux density also
matters because Hayek et al. found that the release of insulin is dose-dependent
withmagneticfluxdensity(Hayeketal.1984).
Secondly, the biological sample differences contributed to the experimental
inconsistencies.ThispointhasalsobeenbroughtupandreviewedinChaps.1and

magneticfieldparameters(alternatingpoleSMFsof400mTand600mT), butthe
glycemia level of T2D mice was different (Li et al. 2020; Yu et al. 2021). We
speculatethatthemicestrainandthemodelingmethodsofthediabeticmicearealso
importantfactors.Yuetal.usedC57BL/6Jmice,whereasLietal.usedICRmice.
And Yu et al. used high-fat chow to feed mice for 6 weeks and then injected
45 mg kg
-1
of STZ, while Li et al. used high-fat chow to feed mice for 2 weeks
and then injected 80 mg kg
-1
of STZ. In addition, our recent studies found that
SMFs also have different effects on glycemia in mild and severe forms of type
1diabetes(unpublisheddata).Therefore,sincetherearemultiplediabetessubtypes,
andthesametypeofdiabetesalsovariesbasedonseverity,theexacteffectsofSMFs
arealsodifferent.
ThethirdfactoristheSMFtreatmentmethod,includingthedurationofexposure,
whethertousepretreatment.Ithasbeenshownthatexposuretimeisakeyfactorthat
contributes to the differential effects of magnetic fields on biological samples. We
exposeddiabeticmicetoSMFfordifferenttimepointsandfoundthattheeffectson
glycemiaaretimedependent.After8weeksSMFexposure,theglycemiaofdiabetic
mice was not reduced, but after 9 weeks SMF exposure, the glycemia of diabetic
mice was significantly reduced compared with the sham control group (Yu et al.
2021). According to László et al. and Li et al. we also found different effects of
SMFs exposure time on glycemia (László et al. 2011; Li et al. 2020). In addition,
SMF pretreatment may also be an important factor contributing to differences in
experimentalresults.WepretreatedthemicewithSMFfor6weeksbeforetheywere
induced for T2D, whereas Li et al. treated the mice with SMF after they were
induced for T2D, which may have contributed to the difference in their results.
Finally,whole-bodyandtargetedexposurewerealsocategorizedasSMFtreatment
method,whichcouldalsobeapotentialfactorforinconsistencies.FromTables10.1,
10.2, 10.4, and 10.5, although there is no report using targeted exposure in exper-
iments, the possibility that researchers will not use targeted exposure in the future
cannot be ruled out. And we advocate that the effects of SMFs on specific organs,
such as the pancreas and liver, should also be explored to discover the specific
biologicaleffectsofSMFsonspecificorgans.
Therefore,inordertopromotethestandardizationofrelatedresearch,werecom-
mend that investigators should carefully design their experiments and accurately
describe the experimental details. This includes but not limited to the relevant
parametersofthemagneticfieldsintheexperiment(thedistanceofmagnetsurface
from tissue, exposure time, magnetic flux density, direction, and distribution), and

as insulin levels and sensitivity, bone mineral density, and angiogenesis markers.

10.7 Potential Mechanisms for the Effects of Static
Magnetic Fields on Glycemia or Insulin
Somepreliminaryinvestigationsofthepotentialmechanismsunderlyingtheeffects
ofSMFsonglycemiaandinsulinhavebeenperformed(Fig.10.4).Forexample,it
was shown that pancreatic islet β-cells can release insulin to reduce glycemia, and
SMFs may affect transcription factors and transport channels in pancreatic islet
β-cells to regulate insulin secretion (Gorczynska and Wegrzynowicz 1991; Lahbib
etal.2015a;Maoetal.2017).Someothermechanismshavebeenproposed,suchas
iron metabolism, norepinephrine, insulin conformation, cell membrane
conformation.
However, it should be mentioned that although these mechanistic study results
are listed in Fig. 10.4, it is clear that there is still no consensus model so far.
Moreover, most of them are hypothesis-based, and the direct molecular evidence,
or more importantly, the physical mechanism is still lacking. In addition, due to
differencesintheSMFparameters,treatments,andsubjectsusedinthesestudies,the
mechanisms by which SMFs affect glycemia and insulin levels are very diverse.
Therefore,inthefuture,weshouldsystematicallystudytheirmechanismandfocus
moreonabiophysicalperspective.
10.8 Conclusion
In conclusion, although the regulation of glycemia and insulin levels by SMFs is
inconclusivesofarduetotheSMFsparameterandbiologicalsampledifference,itis
clear that multiple SMFs treatment modalities have shown significant beneficial
effects on diabetic complications, especially the consistently improving effects on
diabetic wound healing. In addition, based on current experimental evidences, we
have also revealed some clues to optimize SMF parameters to achieve better anti-
diabeticeffects,includingSMFfluxdensity,direction,anddistribution.Webelieve
thatmoresystematicandin-depthinvestigationswilldefinitelyhelpustounravelthe
detailed mechanisms of SMF regulation on diabetes and its complications, both
biologically and physically, so that we can eventually take the best advantages of
SMFsandapplythemintheclinicaltreatmentofdiabetes.

11.1 Introduction
The maintenance of healthy bone tissues requires continuous bone remodeling,
which includes osteoclast-mediated dissolution and resorption of old or damaged
bone and osteoblast-mediated new bone formation. Magnetic fields have unique
ability to penetrate and act directly on bone tissues. Since Bassett et al. firstly
reported that magnetic field can effectively accelerate fracture healing in 1970, a

field was approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the adjuvant
treatmentofclinicalbonediseasessuchasosteoporosisandosteoarthritis.
Staticmagneticfield(SMF),withconstantmagneticfieldstrengthanddirection,
has a long history of basic and clinical research in bone biology. It can be divided
intofourclassesbasedonmagneticfieldstrength,includinghypomagneticfield(<5
μT), weak magnetic field (5 μT–1 mT), moderate magnetic field (1 mT–1 T), and
highmagneticfield(>1T)(Zhangetal.2017c).Numerousstudieshaveshownthat
SMF can prevent and treat osteoporosis or promote fracture healing and bone
regeneration.

11.2.1 Impacts of Static Magnetic Fields on Bone
Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Osteoblasts
Osteoblastsaremainlydifferentiated frombonemesenchymalstemcells(BMSCs)
and perform bone forming functions in bone. The process of bone formation
includesosteoblasticproliferation,differentiation,maturation,andsecretionofvar-
iousmatrixproteins,andfinallymineralizationofthesematrixproteinstoformnew
bone. The effects of SMF on BMSCs and osteoblasts revealed in recent years are
summarizedinTable11.1.
Numerous studies have reported the effect of SMFs on the proliferation of
osteoblast and BMSCs, but different studies have yielded different results. Rat
cranial osteoblasts and osteoblast cell lines UMR106 and ROS17/2.8 were treated
with160mTSMF,andtheproliferationofthesecellswasfoundtobeunaffectedby
theSMF(Yamamotoetal.2003).Ontheotherhand,theproliferationrateofMG63
andMC3T3-E1osteoblastswasinhibitedunderSMF,butthecellcycleprocesswas
not affected (Chiu et al. 2007; Cunha et al. 2013). The cell proliferation of rat
BMSCs was also inhibited by 15 mT SMF (Javani et al. 2013). However, a study
showedthat15mTSMFcanpromotetheproliferationofhumanBMSCs(Kimetal.

to moderate-SMF, some studies have also focused on the effect of high-SMF of
>1Tonosteoblastproliferation.Therewasnosignificantchangeinthenumberof
MC3T3-E1 cells exposed to a SMF at 8 T (Kotani et al. 2002), but 16 T exposure
promoted osteoblast proliferation (Yang et al. 2018b). The possible reason for the
difference in osteoblastic proliferation under SMFs is caused by the inconsistent
inoculumdensityofcells.Indeed,itwasshownthattheeffectof0.4TSMFonthe
proliferation of MG63 cells was dependent on the initial cell density (Huang et al.
2006). The 1 T SMF produced three different effects (no effect, promotion, and
inhibition)oncellswithdifferentinoculumdensities.
AlthoughtheproliferativeresponseofBMSCsandosteoblastsisinconsistentto
differentSMFs,osteogeneticdifferentiationcanbepromotedbySMFwithdifferent
intensities. 15 mT SMF increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, calcium
release, and mineralized nodule formation in human BMSCs in a time-dependent
manner and upregulated the expression of osteogenic marker genes (Kim et al.
2015).BMSCshavethepotentialtodifferentiateintomultiplecelltypes,including
adipocytes and osteoblasts. Decreased osteogenic differentiation and increased
adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs might lead to osteoporosis. Recently, Chen
et al. (2020) demonstrated that SMFs of 0.2–0.6 T promoted the osteoblastic
differentiation but inhibited their adipogenic differentiation of mice BMSCs in an
intensity-dependent manner. SMF at 1 and 290 mT significantly promoted the
osteogenetic differentiation and mineralization of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs)
(Zhengetal.2018;HsuandChang2010).ConsistentwiththeresultsinBMSCsand
DPSCs, numerous studies have shown that SMF also promotes the differentiation
and mineralization of primary osteoblasts and osteoblast cell lines. For example,
160 mT SMF enhanced the formation of mineralization nodules, the calcium
content, and ALP activity inprimaryosteoblasts from rat (Yamamoto et al. 2003);
osteoblastdifferentiationwasfacilitatedby0.4TSMFinMG63humanosteoblast-
like cells (Chiu et al. 2007; Huang et al. 2006); osteoblastic differentiation was
promotedby2TSMFinmouseosteoblasticMC3T3-E1cells(Yangetal.2021a);

DuetothesuperparamagneticpropertyofIONs,exteriormagneticfieldcanalter
their physicochemical properties, and most applications of magnetic nanomaterials
are related to their specific magnetic characteristics. Therefore, the application of
single magnetic nanomaterials to study osteogenic differentiation is gradually
decreasing, and many studies have attempted to combine SMF with magnetic
nanomaterials, and these approaches have better effects than the action of a single
magneticfieldormagneticnanomaterials(Table11.2).

stemcells(ASCs)under200mTSMF.Tangetal.(2020a,b)demonstratedthatthe

of SMF combined with different forms of magnetic nanomaterials can synergisti-
callypromotethedifferentiationofosteoblasts.
11.2.3 Impacts of Static Magnetic Fields on Bone Marrow
Macrophages and Osteoclasts
Osteoclastsaremainlydifferentiatedfrombonemarrowmacrophages(BMMs)and
perform bone resorption functions in bone. In normal physiological conditions,
osteoclast can remove old or damaged bone and induce osteoblasts to form new
bone. In contrast to osteoblasts, there are limited reports on the effect of SMF on
osteoclastdifferentiation.Kimetal.(2018)systematicallyinvestigatedtheeffectof
15 mT of SMF on the differentiation of BMMs to osteoclasts. The results showed
that SMF inhibited osteoclast formation and decreased the activity of tartrate-
resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and bone resorption activity. The inhibition of

osteoclastdifferentiationandboneresorptionfunctionwasalsofoundwhenBMMs
were cultured in conditioned medium after SMF treatment of osteoblasts. Zhang
etal.(2017b)foundthat SMFat0.2Tpromotedpre-osteoclast Raw 264.7cellsto
highly express almost all osteoclast-forming genes, leading to differentiation and
formationofosteoclasts,while16Thadasignificantinhibitoryeffect,whichwasthe
opposite of its effect on osteoclasts. This regulatory effect of SMF on osteoclasts
may be related to the regulation of nitric oxide production and iron metabolism in
osteoclastsbySMF(Zhangetal.2017c;Dongetal.2019).Recently,astudyshowed
osteoclastogenesis can be enhanced by 2 T SMF in vivo and in vitro (Yang et al.
2021b).
11.2.4 Impacts of Static Magnetic Fields on Postmenopausal
Osteoporosis
Postmenopausalosteoporosisisthemostcommonprimaryosteoporosis,andovari-
ectomy (OVX) is the most mature and recognized animal model for studying
postmenopausal osteoporosis. A samarium-iron-nitrogen magnetic material with a
magnetic strength of 180 mT was implanted in the right side of the L3 spinous
processofthelumbarspineofOVXrats,andafter6weeksofexposure,theBMDof
thelumbarvertebraenearthemagneticmaterialwassignificantlyhigherthanthatof
ratsinthesham-operated(Sham)andOVXgroups(Xuetal.2011).Anothergroup
ofOVXratswasexposedtoSMFinthewholebodyat30–200mTfor12weeks,and
the BMD and bone area of the rats exposed to the magnetic material were signifi-
cantly higher than those of the non-magnetized OVX rats (Taniguchi and Kanai
2007). Yang et al. (2021b) exposed OVX mice to 0.2–0.4 T and 0.6 T SMF for
4 weeks and found that SMFs prevented the reduction in bone density, the deteri-
orationintrabecularandcorticalbonemicroarchitecture,andtheweaknessinbone
mechanical properties caused by OVX. Moreover, bone histochemical analysis
revealed that osteoclast formation was decreased in cancellous bone and cortical
bone, and osteoblast formation was increased in trabecular bone by SMF. In
conclusion, these results demonstrate that SMF ca alleviated OVX-induced bone
loss effectivelyand imply that SMF may becomeapotential biophysical treatment
modality for postmenopausal osteoporosis. However, further clinical trials are
neededtoconfirmtheosteoporosis-preventingeffectofSMFs.
11.2.5 Impacts of Static Magnetic Fields on Diabetic
Osteoporosis
Diabeticosteoporosis isone ofthecommonchroniccomplications of people with
diabetes, which belongs to the secondary osteoporosis, mainly manifested as the

--- Page 338 ---

11 ImpactsofStaticMagneticFieldonBoneHealth 329
decrease of bone mass, the increase of fragility, and the reduction of bone micro-
structure(Marinetal.2018;Nilssonetal.2017).Agrowingnumberofstudieshave
shownthatpeoplewithdiabeteshavepoorcontrolofbloodglucosewillcausebone
metabolism disorders, eventually lead to diabetic osteoporosis. At present, it is
generallybelievedthattype1diabetesleadstodecreaseinBMD,whilethesituation
of type 2 diabtes is relatively complicated, and BMD may decrease, remain
unchanged,orevenincrease(Vestergaard2007).
Magnetic fields including both SMF and dynamic magnetic field have been
shown to ameliorate the complications of diabetes mellitus (Choi et al. 2018; Li
etal.2016;Mertetal.2020;Zhaoetal.2017;Lvetal.2021).Recently,thestudyby
Yuetal.showedthat0.4Tor0.6TSMFverticallygrounddowncouldpreventhigh-
fatdiet/streptozocin(HFD/STZ)-induceddiabetesinmiceandimprovetheadverse
physiological state like high blood glucose level in diabetic mice (Yu et al. 2021).
Carter et al. found that short-term exposure of mice with type 2 diabetes to the
compoundfieldofelectrostaticfieldandSMFcouldenhanceinsulinsensitivityand
improveinsulinresistancebyregulatingtheredoxenvironmentofthewholebodyof
mice(Carteretal.2020).
There are several researches about the dynamic magnetic fields on diabetic
osteoporosis (Zhou et al. 2015; Jing et al. 2011; Cai et al. 2018). As to the effects
ofSMFondiabeticosteoporosis,thereareonlyonereport.Zhangetal.showedthat
afterbeingexposedtoa4mTSMFfor16weekscouldinhibitthestructuraldamage
oftrabecularboneandthereductionofbonemechanicalpropertiesofSTZ-induced
diabetic rats (Zhang et al. 2018). In addition, Zhang et al. also found that SMF
increased serum osteocalcin content, promoted bone mineral deposition, and
increased the number of osteoblasts in the bone of diabetic rats (Zhang et al.
2018).TheaboveresearchesmayindicatethatSMFcouldpreventdiabetes-induced
skeletalhealthproblems,includingthedeteriorationofmicrostructure,compromised
mechanicalstrength,andalteredbonemetabolism.
11.3 Impacts of Hypomagnetic Field on Bone Metabolism
Amagneticfieldthatismuchlowerthangeomagneticfield(GMF)isusuallycalled
hypomagnetic field (HyMF, or HMF). The lack of a natural HyMF on Earth, and
researchers need special equipment to set up HyMF environment (Zhang et al.
2021). During long-distance space missions, astronauts will be exposed to an
environment with HyMF (Belyavskaya 2004). Numerous studies have reported
thatHyMFcausesavarietyofinjuriesanddiseasesatthemolecular,cellular,animal,
and clinical levels. Current research showed that HyMF had effects on the central
nervous system, blood system, brain cognition, and embryonic development
(Fu et al. 2016b; Jia et al. 2011; Mo et al. 2012). The HyMF environment has
significantinhibitoryeffectsoncytoskeletonassembly(Moetal.2016),cellprolif-
eration(Moetal.2013),andembryonicdevelopment(Osipenkoetal.2008).
HyMFiscloselyrelatedtothemetabolismofskeletalsystem.Zhangetal.found
that exposure of pre-osteoclast RAW264.7 cells in HyMF for 4 days significantly

330 H.Lvetal.
promoted osteoclastic differentiation and bone resorption activities (Zhang et al.
2017b), which was partly due to reduced nitric oxide (NO) production and NO
synthase activity (Van't Hof and Ralston 2001; Zhang et al. 2017a). Furthermore,
after exposing the osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells to HyMF for 8 days, the matrix
mineralization was restrained, and calcified nodules and calcium deposition were
significantly reduced (Yang et al. 2018b). HyMF inhibited the proliferation and
adhesioncapacityofsatellitemusclecellsisolatedfromrats(Eldashevetal.2011).
Fu et al. found that HyMF exposure for 3 days reduced the skeletal muscle cell
viabilityandmitochondrialactivity(Fuetal.2016a).
HyMF aggravated bone loss induced by hindlimb unloading (HLU) in rats and
mice(Jiaetal.2014;Yangetal.2018a).Inaddition,ironoverloadcontributedtothe
inhibitoryeffectsofHyMFontherecoveryofmicrogravity-inducedboneloss.Xue
et al. found that HyMF inhibits the recovery of microgravity-induced bone loss,
probablybysuppressingtheelevatedironlevels’returntophysiologicallevel.The
study showed that mechanical unloading resulted in bone loss maybe through
inducing the increase in iron levels of the bone, liver, and serum. Following
reloading, the changes in iron metabolism-related protein expression, the increases
inironlevels,andthedamagesinbonephysiologyinducedbymechanicalunloading
were recovered to normal condition under GMF environment. However, these
changes were not recovered in reloaded mice under HyMF. The iron chelator
deferoxamine mesylate (DFO) decreased the iron content in the bone, liver, and
spleen and significantly reversed unloading-induced bone loss under HyMF
reloading(Xueetal.2020).ThesefindingshelpbetterunderstandtheroleofGMF

11.4 Impacts of Static Magnetic Fields on Osteosarcoma
Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant tumor of bone, and its
incidence accounts for about 12% of primary bone tumors (Kansara et al. 2014;
Bielacketal.2009).Osteosarcomamainlyoccursinadolescentsunder20yearsold,
accountingforabout90%oftheincidence(Botteretal.2014).Atpresent,surgical
treatment combined with chemotherapy is currently the most effective treatment
strategy for osteosarcoma (Moore and Luu 2014; Harrison et al. 2018). However,
duetotumormetastasisandlocalrecurrence,the5-yearsurvivalrateofpatientswith
osteosarcoma has not significantly changed in the past few decades. Therefore,
findinganddevelopingnewtreatmentsforosteosarcomaareveryimportantforthe
patientswithosteosarcoma.
The impacts of SMF on tumor are affected by many factors. The maximum
magnetic exposure intensity of the limbs is much higher than that of the trunk and
headunderthecurrentsafetyexposurestandardsforSMFexposure.Moreover,the
mainincidenceareaofosteosarcomaislocatedinthelongbonesoftheextremities,
and there are no large blood vessels and organs in the limbs. Therefore,

asapotentialtherapyforbonetumor.
11.4.1 Impacts of Static Magnetic Fields on Osteosarcoma
Studies have shown that a SMF of 0.618 mT inhibited the proliferation of MG63
osteosarcoma cells (Cohly et al. 2003). Herea et al. reported a kind of
magnetothermal therapy based on alternating magnetic fields and nanoparticles
thateffectivelyinhibitedosteosarcomacells(Hereaetal.2018).12Thigh-intensity
static magnetic field (HiSMF) could induce cell cycle arrest and suppress the
proliferation of MNNG/HOS and U-2 OS human osteosarcoma cells by causing
the excessive accumulation of intracellular free iron and reactive oxygen species
(ROS). Meanwhile, 12 T HiSMF could enhance the cytotoxicity of cisplatin and
sorafenib in osteosarcoma cells. 1–2 T HiSMF inhibited the progression of osteo-
sarcomabothinvivoandinvitro.However,afterexposureto1–2THiSMF,theiron
contentinosteosarcomawassignificantlyreducedcomparedwiththecontrolgroup
(Unpublisheddata).Altogether,thebiologicaleffectoftheSMFonosteosarcomais

11.4.2 Impacts of Static Magnetic Fields on Osteosarcoma
Stem Cells
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a key role in cancer metastasis and recurrence.

ized by the activation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) and
nuclearreceptorco-activator4(NCOA4)anddownregulationofferritinheavychain
1 (FTH1) in OSCs. SMF exposure promoted the self-renewal ability of OSCs via
autophagic degradation of ferritin, implying that ferritinophagy may be a potential
moleculartargetforcancer(Zhaoetal.2021).
11.4.3 Impacts of Static Magnetic Fields in Combination
with Chemical Drugs on Osteosarcoma

dihydroartemisinincombinedwithSMFof16Tdidnotshowanysignificanteffects
onthecellviabilityofosteosarcomacelllinesincludingMG-63,U2OS,143B,and
MNNGHOS(Unpublisheddata).
Metformin is used for treating diabetes mellitus and has also attracted much
attention due to the anti-tumor effects. Metformin inhibited the proliferation of
osteosarcoma cells and osteosarcoma stem cells and induced the apoptosis or
autophagy of osteosarcoma cells dependent on the concentration (Zhao et al.
2019). Metformin combined with indicated concentration of ferric ammonium
citrate(FAC)inducedendoplasmicreticulumstress-mediatedapoptosisinosteosar-
coma. Exposure to 1.5 T SMF could concentrate FAC in the tumor tissue of
osteosarcoma-bearing mice. Meanwhile, metformin combined with FAC inhibited
the growth of osteosarcoma in tumor-bearing mice under 1.5 T SMF
(Unpublisheddata).
High-dose ascorbate acts as an adjuvant therapy for cancer with safety and
tolerabilityandtoacertainextentenhancesthesensitivityoftumorcellstochemo-
therapy drugs. High-dose ascorbate had no toxic effect on osteosarcoma but com-
binedwithcisplatinsynergisticallyinhibitedthegrowthofosteosarcomacells(Zhou
et al. 2020). After intravenous injection or intratumoral injection of
superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle Feraheme, the iron content in tumor
site significantly increased with external SMF of 1 T. Increasing the iron content
in the tumor site by SMF exposure can enhance the inhibitory effect of high-dose
ascorbateonosteosarcoma(Unpublisheddata).

Effects of Static Magnetic Fields
on the Immune System
XinyuWangandXinZhang
Abstract Immunesystemisthefundamentalpartofhumanhealth,whichisclosely
related to various physiological and pathological conditions. Currently, there are
some preliminary studies that have reported the effects of static magnetic fields
(SMFs) on the immune system, at cellular, animal, and human levels. Here in this
chapter, we summarize their experimental results, which show that SMF exposure
can affect immune organs, immune cells, and cytokines, either positively or nega-
tively.TherearealsoafewreportsshowingthatSMFscouldaffectimmunesystem

thecentralnervoussystem.AlthoughtheregulationofnervoussystembySMFsis
still an underexplored research area, these current evidences already show their
promising potentials, which deserves more systematic and in-depth investigations.
Future studies are encouraged to focus on comparing various magnetic flux densi-
ties,gradients,andtreatmentprocedures,aswellasdifferentaspectsoftheimmune

12.1 Introduction
As we all know, the immune system plays a key role in maintaining the health of
living organisms. It has a large and complex network of immune organs, immune
cells, and cytokines, which not only serves as the organism’s tissue system for
executing immune responses and immune activities, but also plays an essential
role in practically all aspects of human health (Parkin and Cohen 2001). When a

system,whicharediscussedintheotherchaptersofthisbook.Herewefocusonthe

12.2 Effects of Static Magnetic Fields on Immune Organs
Immune organs, such as the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes, are the sites where
immune cells are produced, developed, matured, and settled. There are multiple
studies showing that SMFs can affect immune organs, most of which were
performed by exposing the whole animal to SMFs, except for one in vitro study
(Table 12.1). Most studies showed that SMFs could affect the cell numbers in the
spleen and bone marrow. However, since researchers have used different MF flux
intensitiesanddirections,aswellasdifferentmodelanimalsandtreatmenttime,itis
currently hard to draw an explicit conclusion of the exact effect about SMFs on
immuneorgans.
SeveralinvivostudiesshowingthatSMFscouldaffecttheweightorcellcountof
immune organs, butdo not produce pathologicalchanges in these immune organs.
Most of these studies were performed in healthy mice. For example, Djordjevich
etal.exposedmaleSwiss-Webstermiceto16mTSMFsofdifferentdirectionsfor
28 days and observed increased total cell number and lymphocyte number, a
decreaseofgranulocytesnumberinthespleensofSMF-treatedgroups(Djordjevich
etal.2012).SimilarresultswereobservedlaterbyMilovanovichandhiscolleagues,
whofoundasignificantlyincreasedtotalspleencellcountanddecreasedgranulocyte
count but no significant pathological changes in the spleen tissue of SMF-treated
maleSwiss-Webstermice(Milovanovichetal.2016).In2019,Wangetal.exposed
healthy C57BL/6 mice to high SMFs at 2–12 T for 28 days and did not find
significant pathological changes in the spleen (Wang et al. 2019). Also, Tsuji et al

exposed healthyBALB/C micetohighSMFat5Tfor24h,48handdidnotfind
significant changes inspleen weight(Tsuji et al. 1996). However, when our group
exposed C57BL/6 mice to SMFs of higher densities (3.5–33 T) and shorter time
(1–2 h), we found an increase in spleen weight in the 13.5 T-treated mice and a
decrease in spleen weight in the 33.0 T group. But there was no significant patho-
logical change in their spleen tissue (Tian et al. 2019, 2021). The reasons for the
spleenweightchangesarenotclearyet.
Besides the exposure of whole mice to SMFs, in 1993, Janković et al. had
implanted 60 mT micromagnets into the rat brain behind the frontoparietal suture
and behind the occipitoparietal suture. They found an increase in thymus weight
occurredafter 21 and25 daysoftreatment, respectively (Jankovićetal.1993a,b).
There are also some studies performed on disease animal models, including spon-
taneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and leukemia-prone AKR mice (Bellossi et al.
1986;Tasicetal.2021).Tasicetal.foundthatexposureofmaleSHRratsto16mT
SMF of different directions for 30 days resulted in different changes in total bone
marrow cells while similar changes in total spleen cells, spleen erythrocytes, and
spleengranulocytes(Tasicetal.2021).Bellossietal.exposedleukemia-proneAKR
micetouniformvs.inhomogeneousMFsandfoundnosignificantchangeinspleen
weightineithergroup,butincreasedthymusweightinmiceexposedto600mTand
800mTuniformMFs(Bellossietal.1988).
The in vitro study by Ivanova et al. shows that a 0.2 mT SMF can increase the
proliferation rate of splenocytes originating from the mesoderm (Ivanova et al.
2018), which could potentially explain the changed spleen size in other in vivo
studies.However,theexacteffectsofdifferentSMFsonvarioustypesofspleencell
proliferation are still not clear. The differential effects of SMFs with different
directionsandtheirunderlyingmechanismsalsoneedfurtherinvestigations.
12.3 Effects of Static Magnetic Fields on Immune Cells
Immune cellsaremainlydividedintotwotypes:innateimmune cellsandacquired
immune cells (Fig. 12.1). When the body is invaded by pathogens, innate immune
cells are the first line of the body defense, which will respond rapidly and
non-specifically. In contrast, acquired immune cells can target and destroy the
invading pathogens in a specific way (McComb et al. 2019). It has been reported
thatSMFscanproduceavarietyofeffectsonimmunecells,whicharerelatedtothe
SMF direction and flux density, the types of immune cells, and the exposure
procedure(Table12.2).
As we can see in Table 12.2, there are more studies performed on the innate
immune cells than acquired immune cells. Upon exposure to moderate SMFs, the
innate immune cells tend to get more activated and initiate the inflammatory
responses in mice and human. For example, the phagocytic capacity of C57BL/6
mice macrophages and the phagocytic index of Raw 264.7 macrophages were
decreased after SMF-treated (Flipo et al. 1998; Dini and Panzarini 2010), the

pro-inflammatory cytokine of human macrophages was decreased, and the anti-
inflammatory gene expression of db/db mice macrophages was increased after
SMF-treated (Vergallo et al. 2013; Shang et al. 2019). Exposure of granulocytes
fromhealthyhumanbloodandratperitonealneutrophilstomoderateSMFresulted
intheproductionofreactiveoxygenspecies(ROS),whichisfoundtobeassociated
with the exposure time and SMF direction (Noda et al. 2000; Poniedzialek et al.
2013). Natural killer cells (NK cells) are found to be more cytotoxic under 0.4 T
SMF (Lin et al. 2019). The few studies related to the effects of SMFs on acquired
immunecellsweremostlyperformedunderadditionalstimulation.Forexample,the

12.3.1 Effects of Static Magnetic Fields on Macrophages
Macrophages are one of the essential innate immune cells in the body, which are
mainlyinvolvedinimmunedefenseandinflammatoryregulation(ParkinandCohen
2001).SeveralstudieshaveshownthatSMFscanaffectthephagocyticfunctionof
macrophages.Forexample,in1998,itwasreportedthatmacrophagesisolatedfrom
C57BL/6miceexposedtoaSMFof0.8–1.4mTfor24hresultedinanincreasein
Ca2+ level and a concomitant decrease in their phagocytic capacity (Flipo et al.
1998).In2010,Dinietal.notedthat6mTSMFdecreasedthephagocyticindexand
phagocytic rate of macrophages. They also found that compared to early stages of
macrophage differentiation, the SMF had a greater effect on macrophages at later
stagesofdifferentiation(DiniandPanzarini2010).Inordertogaininsightintothe
mechanisms by which SMFs affect macrophage function, some researchers have
focusedonthereleaseofinflammatoryfactorsfrommacrophagesandtheexpression

for 24 h and found that the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as
interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and transforming growth factor-α
(TNF-α) was inhibited (Vergallo et al. 2013). In 2019, Shang et al. found that an
inhomogeneousSMF(alternatingN/Spoleofmagnetsof0.6Tmaxatthesurface)
could upregulate anti-inflammatory gene expression in macrophages, promoting
macrophagemigration, polarization towardM2andwoundhealing,and ultimately
inflammationresolution(Shangetal.2019).TheseresultssuggestthattheSMFmay
affecttheinflammatoryfunctionofmacrophagesthroughgeneexpression.
12.3.2 Effects of Static Magnetic Fields on Neutrophils
Neutrophils are also called polymorphonuclear leukocytes. When a pathogen
invades, neutrophils accumulate at the site of infection under the action of

--- Page 354 ---

12 EffectsofStaticMagneticFieldsontheImmuneSystem 345
chemotactic factors and kill the pathogen through phagocytosis and degranulation.
To kill the pathogen entrapped inside the vacuole, neutrophils produce and release
high quantities of antibacterial peptides, proteases, and ROS. The robust ROS
production is also called “the respiratory burst” (El-Benna et al. 2016; Liew and
Kubes2019).Asfarasweknow,therearetworeportsaboutSMFsandneutrophils,
which bothfocused on the ROS levels changes. For example,in 2000, Noda et al.
exposedratperitonealneutrophilstoSMFsof2.5mTand20mTfor400–2000sand
observed enhanced ROS levels during the respiratory burst in a time-dependent
manner (Noda et al. 2000). In 2013, Poniedziałek et al. exposed peripheral blood
neutrophilsfrombloodsamplesofhealthyindividualstoinhomogeneousSMFsfor
15, 30, or 45 min while treated them with a respiratory burst stimulant phorbol
12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) that induces oxidative burst in neutrophils
(Poniedzialek et al. 2013), they found that exposure of PMA-stimulated and
unstimulated cells to a SMF for 15 min resulted in ROS levels decrease, while
extendingtheincubationperiodto45minresultedinROSlevelsincrease.However,
there was no significant difference in ROS levels after 30 min of incubation
(Poniedzialek et al. 2013). Although these two studies got different results, they
both showed that the SMF effects on ROS are exposure time-dependent. This is
similartotheinconsistenteffectsonROSlevelsinothersystems,whichisdiscussed
inChap.6ofthisbook.
12.3.3 Effects of Static Magnetic Fields on Lymphocytes
Lymphocytes are at the heart of the immune response. According to their origin,
morphologicalstructure,surfacemarkers,andimmunefunction,lymphocytescanbe
dividedintothreetypes:Tcells,Bcells,andNKcells(LarosaandOrange2008).T
cells are responsible for clearing intracellular pathogens and tumors (Larosa and
Orange 2008). B cells provide humoral immunity against extracellular pathogens
throughantibodyproduction(LarosaandOrange2008).NKcellsplayanimportant
roleininnateimmunityandrespondtocytotoxicityandcytokinerelease(Chenetal.
2020).
According to the differentiated antigens on their surface, T cells can be divided
into two major subpopulations, CD4+ vs. CD8+ T cells (McComb et al. 2019).
Jankovićand his colleaguesimplanted60 mT micromagnets into thebrainsof rats
and revealed increased CD4+ T cell number and decreased CD8+ T cell number
(Janković et al. 1991, 1993a) PHA, an initiator of mitosis in cultures of peripheral
lymphocytes, can promote mitotic transformation of peripheral blood lymphocytes
into different types of lymphocytes (Pisciotta et al. 1967). Onodera et al. used
peripheralbloodmononuclearcells(PBMCs)extractedfromhealthyhumanbodies,
including lymphocytes and monocytes, and stimulated them with PHA along with
SMF treatment. They found that a 10 T SMF exposure reduced the viability of
PHA-activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subpopulations, although the 10 T SMF

chainwereupregulatedinSMF-treatedCD8+Tcells.Atthesametime,thelevelof
intracellular ATP was increased in SMF-treated CD8+ T cells (Fig. 12.2). They
believed that SMF promotes the transcription of Uqcrb and Ndufs6 via candidate
magnetoreceptor genes and designed experiments to prove it. And they also found
that 0.3 T SMF exposure enhanced CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity and promoted the
antitumorfunctionofCD8+Tcellsinvivo(Zhuetal.2020).
Asfarasweknow,thereisnoreportedstudyabouttheeffectofSMFonBcells

2019,Linetal.exposedNK92-MIcelllinestoa0.4TSMF.TheyassessedtheNK
cell viability by MTT assay and tested the signaling cascades with inhibitors of
DAG/IP3, STAT3, ERK, JNK, and p38 pathway. It was found that a 0.4 T SMF
significantlyincreasedtheviabilityofNK92-MIcellsbyactivatingmultipleMAPK
signaling pathways (ERK, JNK, and p38-MAPK), which in turn increased their
abilitytokillK562tumorcells(Linetal.2019).ThissuggeststhatSMFcanincrease
NK cytotoxicity and viability, which might boost the anti-cancer capacity of NK
cells.
There arealso some researchers directly isolate lymphocytes from human orrat
bloodwhentheyexaminetheeffectofSMFs,withoutdifferentiatethespecifictypes.
For example, in 2009, Tenuzzo et al. found that a significant decrement of the
apoptotic rate in both freshly isolated and aged lymphocytes when cells were
challenged with apoptogenic treatment under 6 mT SMF. Also, when SMF was
appliedduringtheagingoflymphocytes(5daysofculture),therateofspontaneous
apoptosiswasloweredbySMFtreatment.Theinvestigationofthegeneexpression
in freshly isolated and in culture-aged human lymphocytes indicates that SMF
exposure for up to 24 h increased bax and p53, and decreased hsp70 and bcl-2
(Tenuzzo et al. 2009). In 2002, Jajta et al. found that when SMFs were combined
withdrugs,morepronouncedapoptosisoccurred.Forexample,Jajteetal.exposed

immune cells, stromal cells (e.g., vascular endothelial cells, fibroblasts, epithelial
cells,etc.),andcertaintumorcellsafterstimulus(TomarandDe2014).Theycanbe
dividedintointerleukins(IL),interferons(IFN),tumornecrosisfactor(TNF),colony
stimulating factors (CSF), etc. They have various functions such as regulating the
growth of specific tissues and defending against viruses (Dembic 2015). Several
studies have explored the effects of SMF on cytokines at the animal and cellular
levels(Table12.3).

“Micromagnetic beads of convex ‘N’ polarity and flat ‘S’ polarity, 5.4 mm in diameter and
2.7 mm thick, of 60 mT (600 Gauss) influx density, and of magnetic field’ s influence of about

bilaterallyintotheskullanteriortothefrontoparietalsuture(frontalbrainexposure),
posterior to the frontoparietal suture (parietal brain exposure), and posterior to the
occipitoparietal suture (occipital brain exposure), with the N pole facing the skull,
and treated the rats for 34 days. They observed an increase in the cellular ratio of
CD4+/CD8+ T cells, higher antibody potency, and enhanced overall immunity to
humoralandcell-mediatedimmuneresponses(Jankovićetal.1991).Itisinteresting
thatwhenthemagnetswereimplantedontheskulloccipitalregion,whichiscloseto
vicinity of the pineal gland, the highest immune response was obtained. Next, in
1993,theyremovedtheratpinealglandandimplantedtwomagnetsfacingtheskull
symmetricallybehindtheoccipitoparietalsutureandfoundthattheantibodylevels
in rats with pineal gland excised and implanted with micromagnets are similar to
those of control rats, whereas rats with pineal gland unexcised and implanted with
micromagnetshadincreasedantibodylevelsandincreasedthymusweight(Janković
etal.1993b).Thisindicatestheinvolvementofpinealglandinthismagnet-induced

inthisregulation.
The pineal gland is the part of brain that secretes melatonin (Sapède and Cau
2013).Itwasreportedthatoneofthemostsignificantmelatonin’spleiotropiceffects
is the regulation of the immune system (Carrillo-Vico et al. 2005). Although MFs
have been reported to reduce nocturnal pineal melatonin secretion (Welker et al.
1983), it is unclear whether melatonin plays a key role when the magnets were
implantedontheskulloccipitalregion,whichrequiresmoreexperimentstoprove.

12.6 Conclusion
From the limited reports mentioned above, we can see that SMFs could generate
impacts on some aspects of the immune system, including the cell numbers in
immune organs, macrophage function, ROS released by neutrophils, lymphocyte
apoptosis,NKcellcytotoxicityandcytokineslevels,etc.Itisinterestingthatafew
studies indicate that moderate SMF may be able to promote the immune response
more toward the anti-inflammatory direction by regulating macrophages, increase
the cancer-killing capacity of T cells and NK cells, as well as modulating the
immune system through distally applied magnet on the skull. Moreover, it seems
that moderate to strong SMFs may affect the apoptosis of aged or drug-treated,
affectingdividing,butnotnondividingimmunecells,whichrevealsthepotentialto
explore the combination of SMFs with other treatment methods. However, it is
apparentthattherearestilltoofewstudiesaboutSMFsonimmunesystemforusto
drawanyexplicitconclusions.Ourchapterhereisjusttoprovideastartingpointfor
peoplethatareinterestedinthisaspect.HowSMFsofdifferentparameters,includ-
ing from weak to high SMFs with low to high gradient, can affect the detailed
immuneresponses,includingdifferentsubpopulationsofT,B,andNKcellsarestill
unclear.Whether SMFscan affect some autoimmune diseases, suchas rheumatoid
arthritis,systemiclupuserythematosus,andurticariaareunknowneither.Therefore,
peopleareencouragedtoperformmorewellcontrolleddouble-blindedexperiments
to unravel the potential applications of SMF on immune system, which will
undoubtably provide the basis for multiple physiological and pathological condi-
tionsofhumanhealthinthefuture.

YueLvandXinZhang
Abstract Theapplicationsoftranscranialmagneticstimulation(TMS)andmagne-
toencephalography (MEG) have demonstrated the interconnected relationship
betweentime-varyingmagneticfields(MFs)andthenervoussystem.Moreover,in
recentyears,dozensofstudieshaveshownthatstaticmagneticfields(SMFs)could
also influence the nervous system of animals and humans, either positively or
negatively.Forexample,somestudieshaveshownthatSMFsofcertainparameters
could have some analgesic effects, while high-field magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) could induce transient dizziness, nausea, and vertigo in some people. How-
ever, the specific effects of SMFs on the nervous systems have not been systemat-
ically explored or reviewed due to the diversity of magnetic parameters, research
objects, and detection standards. This chapter focuses on the SMF effects on the
nervoussystematcellular,animal,andhumanlevels,whichwillhelptounderstand

13.1 Introduction
The nervous system in our human bodies affects every aspect of us, not only
includingourconsciousmovementandthinking,butalsotheunconsciousbreathing
anddigestion.Mostvertebrates,includingbirds,reptiles,andmammals,havebotha
centralnervoussystem(thebrainandspinalcord)andaperipheralnervoussystem
(thecranial,spinal,andsplanchnicnerves).
Nervoussystemsarecomposedoftwotypesofcells,nervecellsandglialcells.
Nervecellsarealsocalledneurons,whichareindividualspecializedcellsthatserve
asthebasicbuildingblocksandstructuralunitofthenervoussystem.Theycanbe
divided into motor neurons (receive signals from the brain and spinal cord and
transmit them to relevant organs) and sensory neurons (receive signals from the
sensoryorgans andtransmitthemtothebrainandspinalcord),dependingontheir
function.Glialcellsincludemultiplecelltypes,suchasastrocytes,oligodendrocytes,
microglia,ependymalcells,andradialgliainthecentralnervoussystem,aswellas

neuronalcells,butalsoincludegliacells.
There are many intertwining links between the nervous system with magnetic
field(MF).Forexample,magnetoencephalography(MEG),anoninvasivetechnique
thatcapturestheMFsgeneratedbysynchronizedintraneuronalelectricalactivityof
human brain, can provide unique information about the electrophysiological brain
activity (Baillet 2017; Stefan and Trinka 2017). Transcranial magnetic stimulation
(TMS), an electromagnetic technique stimulates small regions of the brain to
diagnoseortreatmultipleneuronaldiseases,suchasstrokeanddepression(Hallett
2007; Rossi etal. 2009; Pitcher et al. 2021). Besides, magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is a safe and widely used noninvasive diagnostic technique, but can cause
sometransientneuronalsideeffectsonpatient,suchasdizziness,nausea,andvertigo
(Heilmaier et al. 2011). Moreover, it is very interesting that multiple studies have
reported the correlation of suicide with geomagnetic field disturbance caused by
solarstorm(Partonenetal.2004;Berketal.2006;Nishimuraetal.2020).
Although the above-mentioned cases are not exactly caused by static magnetic
fields(SMFs),whichhasaconstantmagneticfieldoveracertainperiodoftime,they
have demonstrated multiple entangled connections between the nervous systems
with magnetic fields. In this chapter, we will summarize the SMF effects on the
nervoussystem,aimingtorecapitulatetheknownfactsandprovideastartingpoint

no significant changes in the survival rate of astrocytes in the rat neocortex and
hippocampus after exposure to a 100 mT SMF for 7 days. However, there were
significant changes in the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PNCA), along with neuronal marker protein
microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP 2) (Hirai and Yoneda 2004). Moreover,
Khodarahmi et al. found that the exposure to a 2.1 T SMF for 2 h or 72 h had no

13.2.3 Some SMFs Inhibit Neural Cell Functions
In2001,astudyreportedthatafterratastrocytesweresubjectedtoaweakSMFof

2001).In2004,Cootsetal.reportedsignificantlyreducedcompoundactionpoten-

andfounditinterferedwiththespontaneousneuralactivityoftheneurons,including
a reduction in the amplitude and frequency of action potentials, a reduction in the
averagefrequencyofextracellularspontaneousactivity(Yangetal.2011).In2012,
it was found that after 6 h exposure of gradient SMF of 0.2–0.7 T, the conduction
velocityofCfibersintheisolatedsciaticnerveofadultmaleAfricanclawedfrogs
was inhibited by 0.7 T SMF, but not 0.21 T SMF, which provided a basis for the
analgesiceffectofmoderateSMFs(Okanoetal.2012).
13.3 Effects of Static Magnetic Fields on Animal Behaviors
Besides theinvestigations ofSMF onneural cells, there arealso many studies that
have observed animal behaviors because an individual’s behavior is mostly con-
trolledbythenervoussystem.

13 BiologicalEffectsofStaticMagneticFieldsontheNervousSystem 361
13.3.1 TheBehavioralEffectsofSMFsExposureonRodents
RodentsareextensivelyusedbyresearcherstostudythebehavioraleffectsofSMFs.
Thebehavioralabilitiesthatarecommonlyobservedandevaluatedincludebalance
ability,socialbehavior,explorationbehavior,activityability,anxiety-likebehavior,
depression-like behavior, and behavior that shows spatial learning and memory
ability,aswellaspain-relatedbehaviors.
13.3.1.1 BalanceAbility
The balance ability is mainly reflected in behaviors such as running, walking, and
turning, which are affected by factors such as motor coordination, vestibular func-
tion, and muscle strength. Researchers found that after exposure to a SMF of
3.5–23.0 T for 2 h, C57BL/6 mice’s balance was temporarily impaired, and the
time to reach the designated position on the balance beam was significantly
prolonged (Khan et al. 2022). In a study by Tkac et al. mice were exposed to
16.4 T and 10.5 T SMFs, and three balance beams with different size and shape
wereusedtoinvestigatetheirbalanceability.Theyfoundthatthefootslipsofmice
in the 16.4 T SMF exposure group were significantly different from the control
group on 15 mm and 8 mm square balance beam, but not on the 17 mm diameter
roundbeams.Miceexposedto10.5TSMFhadnosignificantdifferenceinbalance
beamtestresultsacrossallthreespecificationscomparedtocontrolmice.Moreover,
the researchers also studied the balance abilities of the mice in the SMF “motion”
group that entered and exited the 16.4 T magnet 20 times in 2 min. The 15 mm
squarebalancebeamand17mmroundbalancebeamtestsweresignificantlylonger
than the control group, but the 8 mm square balance beam test results were not
significantlychanged(Tkacetal.2021).Therefore,thestrengthoftheSMF,theway
theanimals areexposed, aswellasthe instruments ofthetest can all influencethe
testresults.
Balanceabilityisalsoconsideredtobeanindicatorofvestibularorganfunction.
When thevestibularsystemisimpaired ordisturbed, dizzinessorimbalance inthe
body occurs, increasing the risk of falls and injuries (Agrawal et al. 2009). The
vestibularsystemhas beenshownto besusceptible toMFdisturbances,leadingto
behavioral changes in animals. For example, Houpt et al. placed adult Sprague-
Dawley rats in a superconducting magnet with a 14.1 T SMF in the center and a
gradientof50T/mandfoundthattheSMFsinhibitedrearingbehaviorandinduced
conditionedtasteaversion,and30minofcontinuousexposuretotheSMFalsoledto
circling behavior in rats (Houpt et al. 2011). It is also consistent with clinical
observationsofdizziness andaltered tasteinMRIsubjects.Furtherresearchfound
thattheangleformedbytheanimal’sheadandthedirectionoftheMFcouldaffect
theircirclingbehavior.Iftherostralaxisofthemouseisinthesame(0°)oropposite

closelyrelatedtovestibularfunction(Houptetal.2007).Moreover,thisresponseis
blocked by chemical labyrinthectomy, showing that the integrity of the vestibular
systemoftheinnerearisimportantforthisMFresponse(Casonetal.2009).
13.3.1.2 SocialBehaviors
In addition, animal social behaviors are a series of complex and important social
interactions between individuals. Social cognition is an important component of
social behavior. At the same time, social interaction and social cognition are
essential to maintaining the structure and stability of social communication within
animal groups (Berry and Bronson 1992). When social behavior is impaired,
individuals are at risk for many neurological disorders, such as depression, bipolar
disorder,schizophrenia,autismspectrumdisorder,andobsessive-compulsivedisor-
der (Battle 2013). In 2013, Kiss et al. investigated the effect of 145 mT homoge-
neousand3–477mTinhomogeneousSMFonsocialbehaviorinpainmodelmiceby
using a special magnet device half full of rubidium magnets. They found that the
SMFgroupmicehadareducedpainlevelandboostedsociability(Kissetal.2013).
In our recent research, we used a three-chambered social test and found that the
social novel index of healthy mice was significantly increased after exposure to a
11.0–33.0TSMF(Fig.13.1),whichindicatedthattheSMFsignificantlyimproved
micesocialabilities(Lvetal.2021).Similarly, 9.4TSMFhadapositive effect of
socialityonimatinib-treatedmicewiththesocialindexsignificantlyincreased(Tian
etal.2022).
13.3.1.3 AnxietyandDepressionLevels
Explorationbehaviorisaninnatebehaviorformanyspeciesprimarilyforsearching
foodandshelter.Inrodents,higherlevelsofanxietywereoftenassociatedwithless
self-exploration and more depression-like behaviors.In 2008, Ammari etal. found
increasedanxietylevelsofratsexposedtoaSMFof128mTfor1h/dayfor5days
(Ammarietal.2008).Laszloetal.foundthattherewerenostatisticallysignificant
differencesonanxietylevelsbetweenSMF-exposedmice(30min,2–754mT)and

30 days of continuous exposure to a SMF with an average gradient of 10 mT/cm,
the anxiety levels were lower in male rats of spontaneously hypertensive model

exposure decreased the anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors of healthy
C57BL/6mice(Lvetal.2021).Ourgroupalsohavefoundthat9.4TSMFenhances
the anti-anxiety and anti-depression levels and exploratory activities in imatinib
mesylate treated tumor-bearing mice (Tian et al. 2022). It seems that the specific
effects of SMF on rodents’ anxiety, depression, and exploration behavior were
influenced by a variety of factors, including SMF parameters, exposure time, and
experimentalsubjects.

learning and spatial memory of rodents. Ammari et al. found that 128 mT SMF
exposure resulted in poor performance in the Morris water maze test in rats,
indicating spatial memory impairment (Ammari et al. 2008). Similarly, Tkac et al.
found a significantly longer escape latency in the water maze after 4 weeks of
chronic exposure to a 16.4 T SMF than in the control group. But the 10.5 T SMF
did not result in any significant changes in the Morris water maze test (Tkac et al.
2021).However,thestudyofKhanetal.showedthatthemiceintheSMF-exposed
group had a much shorter escape latency compared with the mice in the sham
exposure group, which was accompanied by an elevated expression of calcium/
calmodulin-dependentproteinkinaseII(CaMKII)(Khanetal.2022).Ourstudyalso
showed that 11.0–33.0 T SMF can improve the performance of healthy C57BL/6
mice in Morris water maze test, which suggested that high SMF can improve the
learningandspatialmemoryofmice(Lvetal.2021).

suggests that otolith fusion directly affects the larvae’s swimming ability and

reported that free swimming of zebrafish larvae was not affected by a 9.4 T SMF
exposure for 24 h, except for finer visual functions such as delayed response
development. However, this developmental delay of zebrafish larvae disappeared
after1dayofreturningtoanormalenvironment(Fig.13.2)(Geetal.2019).

significantly decreased, indicating a marked decrease in striatal cortex excitability
(Rosen and Lubowsky 1987). Using 0.5 T neodymium magnets, Aguila et al.
reported the effects of SMF on the nervous systems of awake macaques and cats
under anesthesia with transcranial static magnetic field stimulation (tSMS). They
found that tSMS reduces cortical excitability in macaques and decreased neuronal
responses in cats by reversibly altering cortical perception and neuronal activity
(Aguilaetal.2016).
13.4 Effects of Static Magnetic Fields on the Nervous
System in Humans
13.4.1 MRI-Related Studies
Currently,high-fieldSMFshavebeendemonstratedtotransientlyaffectthehuman
nervous system and cause neurological symptoms or influence behavior. Subjects
oftenexperiencesomediscomfortfollowingtheMRIexamination,suchastransient
butseverevertigo,nystagmus,metallictaste,andtinglinginandaroundthemachine
(Heilmaier et al. 2011). It has been proposed that the vertigo, nystagmus, and
metallic taste are related to the interference of SMF with vestibular system, and
thetinglingsensationisrelatedtotheelectricfieldsinnervesandmusclesbyrapid
changesingradientMFs(DeWildeetal.2005;KimandKim2017).Additionally,
these symptoms are also worsened with higher field of MF, so individuals in 7 T
MRI may experience more discomfort than in 1.5 T MRI (Hoff et al. 2019). Staff

et al. 2020). In 2013, 41 healthy subjects underwent extensive neuropsychological
testing, such as memory, hand-eye coordination, and attention following MRI at
different MFstrengths(1.5T,3.0T,and7.0T).Duringtheexamination,although

subjectsexperiencedtransientsymptomssuchasdizziness,nystagmus,phosphenes,
and tinnitus, none of the three types of MRIs caused severe impairment to the
subjects’ cognitive functions (Heinrich et al. 2013). It is interesting that when
researchers compared 10 healthy and 2 patients lacking labyrinthine function in
SMFgeneratedby3Tand7TMRIfortheireyemovementandstinging,theyfound
thatallhealthysubjectsexperiencedintensenystagmusinMRI,butnotthepatients

SMF-induced nystagmus. It also showed that nystagmus intensity was not only
proportional to MF intensity, but also related to MF direction and subject’s head
orientation(Robertsetal.2011).
At present, the safety studies of high-field MRI show that SMFs generated by
high-field MRI are relatively safe for human nervous system. The international
safetystandardofSMFexposuresisintroducedinChap.8ofthisbook,Tables8.1
and8.2,whichsettheuplimitofSMFexposureto8T.Moreover,researchersfound
thatexposuretoaSMFof9.4TgeneratedbyMRIdidnotsignificantlyaffectvital
signsorcognitiveperformanceinhealthyvolunteers(Atkinsonetal.2007).In2020,
a study found that cognitive functions like fatigue, executive ability, and working
memory were not significantly impacted by 10.5 T high-field MRI, except for eye
movement responses and metallic taste (Fig. 13.3). Among them, metallic taste is
obviously related to field intensity, which increases with the increase of field
intensity, and vertigo sensation has a weak trend with field intensity. However, it
is interesting that lightheadedness, nervousness, double vision, warm/cold feeling
wereallreducedwithincreasedfieldstrengths(Fig.13.4)(Grantetal.2020).
Moreover, for pregnant women and newborns, a Canadian clinical report found
no significant increase in congenital developmental abnormalities among pregnant
women undergoing MRI in the first 3 months of pregnancy (Ray et al. 2016). For
ultra-high-field MRI, Budinger and Bird pointed out that there are no foreseeable

investigated the effects of SMFs on pain, which have been reviewed by our group
in 2021 (Fan et al. 2021). We did a meta-analysis of seven trials that assessed the
analgesiceffectofSMFbypainscore(Fig.13.5).Thepooledestimateoftheeffect

between SMF treatment and the placebo control had marginal significance, which
suggestedthatSMFtreatmentdoeshavemoderatepainreliefeffect.Moreover,we
recentlyfoundthatincreasedMFfluxdensitycandirectlyandsignificantlyincrease

Researchers have also attempted to explore the effects of SMFs on the human
nervous systemusingtSMS. Forexample,in2011,Olivieroetal.recordedsingle-
pulseTMS-evokedmotorpotentialsinthemotorcortexof11awakesubjectsbefore
and after 10 min of tSMS. They found an average 25% reduction in motor cortex
excitability that persisted for several minutes after the end of tSMS, which was

inChap.12ofthisbook.
13.5 Discussion
Currently, there are some studies that have tried to unravel how SMFs affect the
nervous system. Among them, the most well studied are the SMF-induced nystag-
mus and vertigo through vestibular system. Magnetic vestibular stimulation is
generated by the interaction of MFs with ionic currents naturally occurring in the
lymphaticfluidinsidethelabyrinth.Robertsetal.describedthisinmoredetail.They
suggest that the MF generates Lorentz forces that push against the apex of the
semicircular canals, resulting in nystagmus, and emphasize the dual role of endo-
lymphinthetransmissionofioniccurrentandfluidpressure.Atthesametime,the
cup-likevestibularorganactsasapressuresensor,allowingMFstocausenystagmus
and vertigo (Fig. 13.6) (Roberts et al. 2011). Researchers believe the vestibular
structureandfunctionhavegreatsignificanceinthestudyofthenervoussystemand
MFresponsesofanimalsandhumans(Houptetal.2007;Casonetal.2009).
At the cellular level, the results are variable. For example, it has been demon-
strated that extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal

kinase(JNK)weresignificantlyactivated,respectively,inthedifferentiationactivity
andstressresponsesofratcorticalneuronsin5TSMFexposureof1h(Prina-Mello
et al. 2006). It is possible that a deeper cause is MF-induced changes in resting
membranepotential,amicro-scalemagnetofluidiceffect.ASMFalsoaffectsintra-
cellularCa2+concentrations,suggestingthismechanisminvolvesvoltage-dependent
Ca2+ channels. A study reported that crayfish LG neurons’ action potential ampli-
tudes were increased by regulating the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in a
4.74–43.45 mT SMF (Ye et al. 2004). The excitatory postsynaptic potential in LG
neuronswasenhancedafter30minexposuretoan8.08mTO-shapedmagnet.This
conclusion is confirmed by the fact that neither the MF-treated crayfish electrolyte
nor the pre-addition of Ca2+ chelators and intracellular Ca2+ release blockers can
producethesameeffect(Yehetal.2008).
It is possible that the orientation of phospholipids in membrane, microtubules,
andactininSMFduetodiamagneticanisotropycontributedtoatleastsomeofthe
observed effects. For example, Pall et al. observed changes in voltage-dependent
calciumchannel(VDCC)activity,intracellularcalcium,andmembranedepolariza-
tion after SMF exposure (Pall 2013). Eguchi et al. found that Schwann cells were
arrangedparalleltoahighSMFof8Tafterbeingexposedtoitfor60h.Thesame
arrangement of actin backbone happened in Schwann cells, and this cellular orga-
nization was inhibited by small molecules named guanosine triphosphatases Rho
protein-relatedkinases(Eguchietal.2003).

speculated that the cell membrane and ion channels might be affected. Although
nodirectmolecular-level experimental evidencewasprovided,itisinterestingthat

13.6 Conclusion

butdifferencesinexposedsubject,experimentalconditions,includingSMFparam-

The Biological Effects of Long-Term Static
Magnetic Field Exposure
HanxiaoChenandXinZhang
Abstract Although in most cases, people are exposed to static magnetic fields
(SMFs) for just a short period of time, there are increasing situations where
long-term exposure becomes inevitable, including magnets implanted in patients,
magnetic therapy, and occupational exposure of magnetic resonance imaging
staff.Consequently,thepotentialbeneficialand/orharmfuleffectsofsuchexposure,
as well as its underlying mechanism, have triggered research endeavors. In
this chapter, we have collected reported experimental data on animals and humans
that were subjected to SMFs for more than 2 weeks, either continuously or inter-
mittently. In animal models, it is found that long-term exposure to moderate
SMFs can influence multiple aspects, including blood pressure and glucose
regulation, the relief of pain, the promotion of bone formation, etc. Differences
between continuous vs. intermittent exposure, human experimental
results vs. epidemiological studies are discussed. Although most animal and
human studies so far have suggested little/no risk of long-term exposure, or even
beneficialeffectsformostmoderateSMFs,therearestillsomeexclusionsthatneed
attention. More research is still needed to comprehensively assess the exact long-
termbiologicaleffectsofvariousSMFsondifferentphysiologicalandpathological
conditionsbeforewecanmakethebestuseofthem.

14.1 Introduction
Magneticfieldscanbedividedintodifferenttypesdependingontheirparameters.A
constantmagneticfield,whichdoesnotchangeinmagneticfluxdensityordirection
overacertainperiodoftime,iscalledstaticmagneticfield(SMF).Forexample,the
earthissurroundedbyquasi-SMFsof25μT(tesla)and65μT,whicharestaticfora

aremanyapplicationsofSMFssuchasthecorepartofmagneticresonanceimaging
(MRI) machines, the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer, and the
MagLevtrains.DuetotheincreasedexposuretoSMFsinthelastfewdecades,the
interaction between SMF and organisms has become a rapidly developing
researcharea.
Uptonow, researchershave identifiedseveralbiophysical mechanisms ofSMF
inorganisms,includingelectrodynamicinteractionswithionicconductioncurrents,
the orientation of magnetically anisotropic structures in uniform fields, the transla-
tional force exerted on a paramagnetic or ferromagnetic substance placed in a
magnetic field gradient, and modification of chemical reactions (Maret and
Dransfeld 1977; World Health Organization 2006; Torbati et al. 2022). Although
the theories are relatively straightforward, due to the complexity of the biological
systemsandthevariabilityofmagneticfieldsinindependentstudies,theinterpreta-
tions of the various experimental observations have been very complicated and
inconsistent,whichwasdiscussedinChap.1ofthisbook.
Currently,therearelargelytwogroupsofpeoplethatcouldhavelong-termand/or
repeated SMF exposures. One group includes workers in MRI examinations in
hospitals, as well as in magnet factories, who are occupationally exposed to mag-
netic fields. The other group includes people who use magnetic fields to alleviate
diseasesymptomsorimprovehealth.Forexample,amagnetcanbeimplantedonthe
sternum and is paired with an external magnetic brace to treat patients with pectus
excavatum(JamshidiandHarrison2007)orimplantedaroundthedistalesophagus
in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (Bortolotti 2021)
(Fig. 14.1), both of which fall in the category of magnetic surgery. There are also
manypeoplewhouseSMF-basedmagneticmattressandbracelet,etc.Therefore,it
isimportanttofindouttheexactlong-termbiologicaleffectsofmagneticfieldsand
theirpotentialactionsonhumanbodies.
Here we have collected recent studies of long-term SMF exposure (over a
periodof2weeksorlonger,continuouslyorintermittently)inanimalsandhumans,
with a special focus on the detailed magnetic field parameters, which has been
proved to be very critical in the previous chapters of this book. We analyze their
results in the hope of providing better understandings of the long-term biological
effectsofSMFonlivingorganismssothatwecantakethebestadvantageofthemin

14.2 Animal Studies
In this review, we screened studies that were exposed to SMFs for longer than
2 weeks, which are further classified into continuous (SMF exposure 24 h/day for
over2weeks)andintermittent(SMFexposureforseveralminutesorhoursadayfor
over 2 weeks) exposure. Most relevant animal studies used rodents, while other
animal models, such as zebrafish, medaka fish, and marine benthic animals, were
alsoused.

2weeks,eithernon-implantedorimplanted.

vulnerabletoexternalstimulicomparedwithothersystems.Aresearchaboutmarine
benthic animals demonstrated that when Mussels M. edulis was kept in a 3.7 mT
SMF for 3 months during their reproductive period in spring, the gonad index and
conditionindexrevealednosignificantdifferencesfromthecontrolgroup(Bochert
andZettler2004).Theembryodevelopmentinmedakafishinvivowithlong-term
SMF exposure did not reveal any impact on embryo development with 15-day
exposure of up to ~100 mT (Sun et al. 2019). Tablado et al. exposed mice to a
0.7 T SMF for 35 days, and no changes were observed in their testicular or
epididymal weights, and the size of sperm heads was also unaffected (Tablado
et al. 1996, 1998). However, an increase in percentage of sperm head abnormality
(lack ofhook)wasobserved(Tabladoetal.1998).Tablado etal.also showed that
theexposureofpregnantmicetoa0.5–0.7TSMFdidnotchangethebodyortestis-
epididymis weight gain in pups (Tablado et al. 2000). Although not much abnor-
malitieshavebeenreportedinthisaspect,sincethenumberofrelevantstudiesistoo
limited,westillneedmoreinvestigationstomakesuretheexactinfluenceoflong-
termSMFexposureonreproductivesystem.Wehavealsopublishedareviewabout
theSMFeffectonreproductivesystem,includingvariousexposureconditions(Song
etal.2022).
There are also several studies that have explored the effects of SMFs in blood
pressureregulation.In 2003, Okano etal. found that 3.0–10.0 mT or 8.0–25.0 mT
SMF exposure for12weekscansuppressandretard thedevelopmentofhyperten-
sion in spontaneously hypertensive rats (Okano and Ohkubo 2003). In addition,
lowerfieldof5mTproducedthesameeffect ofreducingbloodpressurebut1mT
did not have such effect (Okano et al. 2005a). This conclusion was confirmed in
2017byTasićetal.(2017).Besides,itwasshownthataloop-shapedflexiblerubber
magnet adjusted to the neck region of a rat with intraperitoneal phenylephrine and
dobutaminefor10weekscansignificantlydepressedagonist-inducedhypertension
(Okano and Ohkubo 2007). However, it is interesting that Okano et al. have
compared the effect of a 25 mT SMF on normotensive (having normal blood
pressure) vs. hypotensive rats. They found that the 25 mT SMF did not cause any
cardiovascularchangesduringanexposureperiodof3months(Okanoetal.2005b)
butcansignificantlyinhibitthereserpine-inducedhypotension(Okanoetal.2005b).
These indicate that SMFs may not affect normotensive animals, but could affect
bloodpressureinpathologicalconditions.Itisveryinterestingandalsopuzzlingthat
SMFs seem to be able to “properly” regulate blood pressure in these animals, by
raisingorloweringbloodpressuretobringitbacktothenormallevel.However,it
shouldbementionedthatmanyofthesestudieswereperformedbythesamegroup
of researchers. Therefore, more research is needed to unravel these intriguing
regulationeffectsofSMFsonbloodpressureregulation.
Other aspects of SMF influences were also investigated, including pain relief,
skeleton system, wound healing, and other diabetic complications. For example,
adjuvantarthritisratsexposedto30mTSMFfor12weeksnotonlyhadapainrelief
effect,butalsoincreasedbonemineraldensity(BMD)(Taniguchietal.2004).Using
the same experiment conditions, Taniguchi et al. found that the ovariectomized
(OVX)-induced BMD reduction could also be inhibited by SMF treatment,

--- Page 393 ---

384 H.ChenandX.Zhang
indicating its potential to be used to reduce menopausal symptoms in postmeno-
pausalwomen(TaniguchiandKanai2007).Chenetal.proposedthatthemagnetic
fields influence bone formation by affecting the differentiation of bone marrow
mesenchymal stem cells (Chen et al. 2020). And the pain relief is probably due to
theimprovementofbloodflowinducedbySMF(KanaiandTaniguchi2012).The
chronic SMF exposure can also increase ATPases, AChE (acetylcholinesterase)
activities, and MDA (malondialdehyde) level in rat synaptosomes (Dinčić et al.
2018).Moreover,ithasalsobeenshownthatthelong-termSMFtreatmentcanhave
positive effects on diabetic wound healing and other diabetic complications (Jing
etal.2010;Yuetal.2021;Fengetal.2022).
It should be pointed out that most long-term SMF exposure studies have used
SMFsof<1T,whichismainlybecauseofexperimentalsetuplimitations.However,
there is one study that has addressed the biological effects of high SMF (2–12 T)
exposureonmicecontinuouslyfor28days.Theyusedalargebore,superconducting
magnettoperformthisstudy.The results showedthat there wereno differences in
the body weight, organ coefficients, or histomorphology of major organs in mice
afterexposure(Wangetal.2019),whichprovidesessentialbiosafetyinformationfor
thefuturedevelopmentofhigh-fieldSMFsinmedicine.
14.2.1.2 Implanted
With the development of magnetic surgery technology, long-term magnet implan-
tation has been shown to be useful in treating multiple diseases, such as pectus
excavatum(JamshidiandHarrison2007;Bortolotti2021),gastroesophageal reflux
disease (Bortolotti 2021), etc. Moreover, numerous studies have reported the posi-
tive effects of moderate SMF on bone system, immune system, and the nervous
system, which has been discussed in Chaps. 11, 12, and 13 of this book. It is
thereforenecessarytoexplorethesafetyandbiologicaleffectsoflong-termmagnet
implantation sothat we cantake thebest advantageofthe SMFinmedicine inthe
future.
There are multiple studies using implanted magnets to examine their effects on
skeleton system (Table 14.2). In 1998, Yan et al. implanted tapered rods with
magnetizationinbilateralfemursofratsandmeasuredtheirBMDandbonecalcium
content 12 weeks after implantation, which revealed that the values increased
compared with unmagnetized group (Yan et al. 1998). The same SMF intensity
butwithatreatmenttimeof21daysalsoleadstoanimprovedosteogenesis(Nagai
etal.2000).Asmalldiscmagnet(max.180mT)implantedtoOVXratsfor6weeks
statistically significantly increased BMD value and improved clinical effect on
osteoporotic lumbar vertebrae (Xu et al. 2011) (Fig. 14.3). Some researchers think
that the improved collateral circulation and blood circulation are the root cause of
promoting bone formation. Ischemic rats whose femoral artery was ligated had
reduced BMD and weight, and these can be reversed at the third week post-
implantationof180mTmagnets(Xuetal.2001).

StudieshavealsoindicatedthatSMFscanaffecthemodynamics.In2005,Okano
et al. investigated the combined effects of a moderate SMF and nicardipine and
foundthattheSMFinducedasignificantincreaseinthenicardipine-inducedhypo-
tension(OkanoandOhkubo2005).TheirsubsequentresearchshowsthattheSMF
mayenhancenicardipine-inducedhypotensionbyantagonizingtheCa2+influxmore
effectivelythroughtheCa2+channels,orduetotheupregulationofinduciblenitric
oxide (NO) synthase (Okano and Ohkubo 2006). Since blood vessel ingrowth is a
pre-requisiteforboneformation,amagnetizedrodimplantationfor3–7weekswas
shown to increase not only hemodynamics but also vasomotion (Xu et al. 2013).
Therefore, although the studies are still very limited, these current results suggest
that magnetic rod implantation may increase bone mineral density by altering
hemodynamics,Ca2+influx,andvasoconstriction.Itisnotclearwhythepermanent
magnetsinthesestudies,regardlessoftherodordisk-likeshape,allhadamaximum
magnetic field density of ~180 mT. We think it was probably the maximum flux
densitytheycangetatthattime,beinglimitedbythemagnetsize.Morestudieswith
different magnetic field conditions are encouraged for validation and/or improve-
ment, which seems to be a promising future development for the application of
SMFs,especiallypermanentmagnets,inmedicine.

It should be mentioned that, theoretically, the movement of animals in SMFs can
generate electrical currents leading to more bioeffects (Crozier et al. 2007). How-
ever, we did not find significant difference between the non-implanted and the
implanted experiments, which may be due to the fact that SMF in most of these
studiesisnotstrongenough,and/ortheanimalsarenotactivelymoving.

14.2.2 Intermittent Exposure
SinceintermittentSMFexposureoveraperiodoftimeismorefeasibleinrealitythan
continuous exposure, many studies have been carried out this way (Table 14.3).
PeoplehaveuseddifferenttypesofSMFdevicesintheirresearch,includingregular
electromagnet and permanent magnet for lower SMF intensities, as well as
superconductingandwater-cooledmagnetsforhigherSMFintensities.
Theexperimentswithpermanentmagnetsusedmagneticfluxdensitiesof~0.5T.
Lászlóetal.foundthatamax.476mTSMFisusefulforchronicpain.Theyfounda
30 min daily magnetic treatment for 2 weeks did not prevent the development of
mechanical allodynia but can inhibit the increased sensitivity in neuropathic pain
(Antal and László 2009). Besides, exposure for 6 weeks in the same experimental
conditions significantly reduces plasma glucose level as compared to control in
diabetic mice (László et al. 2010). They also demonstrated that daily 40-min
wholebodyexposuretoSMFpreventedlipopolysaccharide(LPS)-inducedpreterm
birth(PTB)inmice(LászlóandPórszász2011).Tianetal.usedpermanentmagnets
with max. surface intensity of 0.5 T with upward direction, 6 h a day for 38 days,
which inhibited GIST-T1 tumorgrowthin nude mice by 19.3% (Tian etal. 2018).
Noadverseeffectswerefoundinthesestudies.
For electromagnet-produced SMFs of varying strength, the effects are more
diverse.Itwasshownthata4mTSMFexposurefor16weeks(2h/day)prevented
bonearchitecturaldeteriorationandstrengthreductionintype1diabeticrats(Zhang
etal.2018).And2h/day5mTSMFexposurefor14dayshadnodamagetonoise-
induced hearing loss. The author proposed that although SMFs promoted the
reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in the first, they also accelerate antioxidative
enzymesactivationlater.Thiscombinedactionsfinallycausednegligiblechangesin
hearing loss (Politański et al. 2010). The oxidative stress in rat cortex brain and
hippocampus also increased under the combined effect of SMF and cadmium
(Cd) (Amara et al. 2011). Moreover, although a 128 mT SMF exposure had no
effect on epididymal sperm count, spermatozoa motility, or genital organ weight
after30-dayexposure(Amaraetal.2006a),zebrafishexposedto2.5,5,7.5mThad
increasedlevelsofcortisolanddecreasedsexhormoneconcentrations(Sedighetal.
2019). Therefore, as we have discussed recently, more research is needed on the
effectsofelectromagnetsonthereproductivesystem(Songetal.2022).Moreover,
the effects of SMFs on hematological parameters are also inconsistent. For both
128mTSMFs,Amaraetal.foundthatsubacuteexposure(1h/day,5days)didnot
change hematological parameters but 30-day consecutive exposure significantly
increased hemoglobin, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelet number
(Amara et al. 2006b). While Elferchichi et al. found that SMF 1 h/day for 15 con-
secutive days decreased red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit values
(Elferchichietal.2016).
TheeffectsofSMFsgeneratedbyMRIwerealsodifferent.Pregnantmicewere
exposedattheboreentrance(1.5Tand7T,75min/day,18days)duringtheentire
period of pregnancy, and no effect was observed with pregnancy rate,

14.3 Human Studies
Becauseofexperimentallimitation,ethicalrestrictionandregulations,thereareonly
afewstudiesavailableonhumanSMFlong-termexposure(Table14.4),including
orthodontictoothmovementandpainrelief,bothofwhichshowednoharmful,and
even beneficial effects. For example, Bondemark et al. have studied the effects of
SMF on human dental pulp and gums. First in 1995, they found that the first
maxillary premolar and adjacent gingival tissue exposed to a bonded magnet with
a max. magnetic flux density of 0.09 T did not cause any histologically detectable
changes in human pulp or gums after 8-week exposure in seven individuals
(Bondemark et al. 1995). In 1998, they bonded magnets with slightly higher
intensitiestothebuccalsurfaceoftheupperpremolarsofeightsubjectsfor9months
andfoundSMFsdidnotinfluencehumanbuccalmucosa(Bondemarketal.1998).
In 2003, Weintraub et al. randomly assigned 375 patients with II or III stage of
diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) into the experimental group wearing contin-
uous magnetized insoles (45 mT) for 4 months. Their results showed that the
magnetized insoles can reduce numbness, tingling, and exercise-induced foot pain
(Weintraub et al. 2003). However, other researchers evaluated 11 subjects with
vertebral deformity and back pain and found that repeated 30-min local exposure
(10 times a week) to non-uniform SMF has no clinically significant effect on pain
perception(Mészárosetal.2013).
In fact, for the long-term exposure of SMF on human bodies, one of the best
examples is magnetic sphincter augmentation device (MSAD), an implantable
device that is used in treating gastroesophageal reflux disease (Fig. 14.1) (Ganz
et al. 2016). It has been used world widely. Besides its clinical benefits for effec-
tively treatingGERD,therearealsoseveralstudies conductedonthesafetyofthis
type of treatment. For example, a survey in 100 patients during a 6-year period
showed that MSAD provides safe and long-term reduction of esophageal acid
exposure and substantial symptom improvement (Bonavina et al. 2013). Another
safetyanalysisofthefirst1000patientstreatedwithMSADalsoconfirmsthesafety
ofthisdeviceandtheimplantationtechniqueitself(Liphametal.2015).Moreover,a

14.4 Epidemiological Studies
Although most animal and human studies showed no effects, or even beneficial
effects of long-term SMF exposure, it is interesting and worrisome that some
research in the form of questionnaires indicates some potential risks (Table 14.5).
For example, a survey on the relationship between MRI-generated SMF exposure
andhypertensionshowsthattheoccurrenceofhypertensionmayberelatedtoSMF
exposure (Bongers et al. 2018). Schaap et al. also observed a positive correlation
between the magnetic field strength of MRI scanner and the reported symptoms

Moghadametal.2018).ThesesurveysindicatethatoccupationalexposuretoSMFs
might have some correlations to the appearance of health problems, and magnetic
flux density seems to be a main influencing factor compared with exposure time.
However, these studies did not consider other confounding variables including
environmentalcontaminants,aswellasthepotentialbiasoftheMRIworkers.
14.5 Discussions
Wehavesummarizedthereportedstudiesoflong-termSMFeffectsbytheexposure
method.Itisinterestingthattherearesomedifferencesbetweencontinuousexposure
andintermittentexposure.ContinuousSMFsexposuremostlyshowedeithernegli-
gibleorevenbeneficialeffectswhiletheresultsofintermittentexposurearehighly
variable.Wethinktherearemainlytworeasons.
Firstly, due to the limitations of experimental set up, most continuous SMF
exposure experiments have used permanent magnets. However, the intermittent
exposure experiments have used various magnets. It is interesting that the adverse
effects are usually correlated with electromagnets, but not permanent magnets.
Considering the fact that electromagnetic devices may cause additional heat, noise
andweakelectricfield,itisdifficultsofartodeterminewhethersomeofthereported
adverseeffectsweregeneratedbytheseconfounders.Alsoduetothelimitationsof
experimentalsetup,mostcontinuousSMFexposureexperimentshaveusedmoder-
ate SMF while the SMFs of intermittent exposure are highly variable. It is not
surprising that higher SMF intensity could generate more effects compared to
lowerfield.

--- Page 401 ---

392 H.ChenandX.Zhang
Secondly,wehypothesizethatmaybethegeneraladaptationsyndrome(GAS)is
involved.Ithasbeenshownthattheintensityofanorganism’sresponsetoastressful
stimulus fluctuates with time, which was described as GAS. The stimulus occurs
only once in continuous exposure, but in intermittent exposure the stimulations
occur repeatedly, which may make the biological system very difficult to return to
homeostasis. Weproposethis hypothesis because we foundit interesting that even
using the same type of magnetic field device and same magnetic field intensity, it
was shown that the effects of continuous and intermittent exposure to alternating
magneticfieldsarealsodifferent.Astudyshowedthattheintermittentelectromag-
neticfields(1minON/OFFcycles,repeated10timesevery2h,6times/dayduring
48 h) in combination with NO increased cell death, but the continuous exposure
(48 h) in combination with NO did not induce significant increase in cell death
(Boland et al. 2002). In 1993, researchers studied the influence of 45-Hz magnetic
fieldsonthebrainfunctions.Tenvolunteerswereexposedtoacontinuousfieldand
ten received an intermittent exposure (1 s ON/OFF cycles) for 1 h. Most of the
changes in the measurements of electroencephalograph (EEG) were observed after
intermittentexposure.Continuousexposurewiththesameamplitudeandfrequency
producednosignificantchanges(Lyskovetal.1993).
For human studies, it is interesting that although current experimental results
showednoadverseeffects,theepidemiologicalstudiesusingquestionnairesforMRI
workers have reported the appearance of hypertension, headaches, sleep problems,
andotherhealthproblems.Wethinkthereareatleastfourreasons.Firstofall,the
magnetic field in MRI is higher than most experimental studies, and MRI workers
standingbythemachineareexposedtogradientSMFs.Thesebothcouldcausemore
significantlyeffects.Secondly,mostMRIworkerstakethesurveyhaveworkedwith
theMRImachinesforyearssothattheexposuretimeismuchlonger.Thirdly,since
MRI workers are repeatedly and intermittently exposed to magnetic fields, the
generaladaptationsyndromethatwementionedabovemaycontributetothesymp-
tomsreported.Lastbutnottheleast,thequestionnairescannotexcludepsycholog-
icalfactors.
However,itshouldbementionedthatalthoughreportedstudiesshowedthatmost
long-term SMF treatment did not cause serious harmful effects to animals or
humans, we still need to pay extra attention and perform a lot more investigation.
In fact, we recently found that even moderate SMF of some specific parameter
generatedbypermanentmagnetsmayalsoproduceharmfuleffectsatsomespecial
conditions. For example, we recently found that the health condition of mice that
have consumed a large amount of alcohol (heavy drinking) was deteriorated by
weeks of continuously exposure to upward SMFs of ~0.1 T with magnetic flux of
~4.5 × 10 -3 Wb provided by permanent magnet plate, but not by the downward
direction (Song et al. Our lab unpublished data). In contrast, when using healthy
miceandthesamesetsofSMFdevices,theirhealthconditionsarenotharmedeven
afteryearsofcontinuousexposure.Infact,theirhealthconditionsareevenimproved
(Fanetal.Ourlabunpublisheddata).Thehealthconditionsofmicedrinkinglower
amount of alcohol were also improved by these SMF devices. Moreover, as men-
tioned before, the SMF effects on mice with different blood pressure level before

exposure are totally different. Therefore, the subject’s status is a very important
factor that determines the SMF exposure consequences. Moreover, it was reported
that0.7TSMFexposurefor35dayscouldcause spermheadsabnormality, which
shouldalsocausesomeattentionandmoreinvestigations(Tabladoetal.1998).
14.6 Conclusion
Inthischapter,wehavereviewedthebiologicaleffectsofanimalsandhumansthat
are exposed to SMFs for over 2 weeks, either continuously or intermittently. Most
studies were carried out in animals, which indicate that long-term moderate SMF
exposurecouldpositivelyfunctioninpainrelief,boneformationpromotion,blood
pressure,andbloodglucoseregulation.Althoughthereportedstudiesforhumansare
notveryabundant,currentstudiesfocusedonmoderateSMFs,whichseemtohave
some positive effects too. However, epidemiological studies, most of which used
questionnaires, indicate potential mild negative effects although the influence of
psychologicalfactorswasnotruledout.Moredouble-blindedstudiesareencouraged
toinvestigatetheeffectsoflong-termexposure,whichwillhelptopromotethesafe
applicationofSMFsinhealthandmedicine.

spreadskepticismsurrounding“magnetotherapy”—whichinpartisdeservedbased

15.1 Introduction
Therapies that involve exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs) date back to the
inception of practical methods to harness and exploit magnetism and electricity.
Anecdotal folklore suggests that the subset of these therapies using time-invariant
(i.e., static) magnetic fields (SMFs) extend back two or even 3000 years [perhaps
even to 1000 BC (Mourino 1991)], when “lodestones” were thought to have the
abilitytodrawdiseaseoutofaperson’sbody(Zyss2008;Palermo2015).Jumping
forward, by the early sixteenth century (AD) the Swiss physician Paracelsus was
usingmagnetstotreatepilepsy,diarrhea,andhemorrhage,andinthemideighteenth
century, the Austrian doctor Franz Mesmer had opened a healing salon in Paris to
treattheuntowardeffectsofthebody’sinnate“animalmagnetism”(Mourino1991).
With the advent of electricity as a power source, EMFs were added to the healing

repertoireandwerebeingusedtoassistbonehealingasearlyasthemid-nineteenth
century, with definitive literature reports verifying efficacy appearing in the 1970s
(Bassettetal.1974a,b).
Since World War II, magnetic field therapy (usually referred to as
“magnetotherapy”inthischapter)hasflourishedacrosstheglobe—albeitunevenly
with various levels of acceptance in different countries—with an estimated two
million recipients each year (Markov 2009). Magnetotherapy has many attractive
features, including its relatively low cost compared to many current treatment
modalities, its typically noninvasive nature, and its established safety record (with
obvious exceptions, such as individuals with medical device implants such as
pacemakers or insulin pumps). On the other hand, magnetotherapy has a long-
standing reputation for quackery. To give one example of the origins of this
reputation, by the late nineteenth century, Thatcher’s Chicago Magnetic Company
(a mail order outfit) claimed that “magnetism properly applied will cure every
curablediseasenomatterwhatthecause”(Macklis1993).
Today, similar overblown rhetoric from some quarters continues to obscure the
valid scientific underpinnings of magnetotherapy. In part, magnetotherapy remains
controversial because its opponents persist in making polarized blanket statements
that categorically reject the possibility of beneficial health effects, while many
proponents of magnetotherapy promise miracle cures for long lists of disparate
ailments.Therealityalmostcertainlyliesbetweentheseextremes,andthepurpose
of this chapter is to provide an overview of what is currently known about human
magneticfieldtherapy,whatisnotknown,andwhatneedstobeknown(anddone)
tomovethisfieldforward.
15.2 Overview of Electromagnetic Field (EMF) Treatment
Modalities
Althoughsomewhatarbitrary,EMFtherapeuticmodalitiesaregenerallycategorized
in five categories as outlined by Markov (though some classification schemes give
sixcategories)inanexcellentsynopsisoftheinfluenceofmagneticfieldsonhuman
health(Markov2014).Thesecategoriesarebrieflydiscussedbelow.
15.2.1 Low-Frequency Sine Waves
Low-frequency sine wave (LFS) electromagnetic fields are based on predominant
commerciallysuppliedelectricitysources,whichare60HzinNorthAmericanand
generally 50 Hz in Europe and Asia (Markov 2014). One use of LFS is as an
alternative to high-frequency fields in deep brain stimulation for the treatment of
epilepsy(Goodman2005;Goodmanetal.2005).Anotherpotentialapplicationisfor

thetreatmentofcancer(Blackman2012);morebroadly,effortsareunderwaytouse
diverse frequencies of EMFs including SMFs to treat cancer (Zimmerman et al.
2012).
15.2.2 Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields (PEMFs)
Pulsedelectromagneticfields(PEMFs)arelow-frequencyfieldswithspecificwave
shapesandamplitudes(Markov2014).PEMFtreatmentwasintroducedclinicallyin
the 1970s by Bassett and colleagues, who used a specific biphasic low-frequency
signal for bone healing, particularly for the treatment of delayed fractures (Bassett
et al. 1974a, b). Although reports continue to appear questioning the efficacy of
PEMFtherapy(RoseandBryan-Frankson2008),transcranialmagneticstimulation
devices have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
patients not responsive to chemical antidepressants (Martiny et al. 2010; Anony-
mous 2011). In addition, there are a profusion of PEMF devices that are sold and
marketed as FDA-registered “wellness devices”; these products, however, are not
permittedtoclaimefficacyfortreatingdisease(Anonymous2015).
There are, nevertheless, several studies that do indicate various forms of thera-
peutic effectiveness for PEMF beyond solely bone healing and the treatment of
depression. A study in 2019 by Elshiwi and coworkers indicated that PEMF can
improve the clinical outcomes of physical therapy when used alongside it as a
treatment for lower back pain (Elshiwi et al. 2019). PEMF also has shown thera-
peutic potential forthetreatment ofrheumatoid arthritis and other diseasescharac-
terizedbychronicinflammationandimmunedysfunction(Rossetal.2019).Finally,
recent studies concluded that PEMF has a pro-osteogenic and pro-chondrogenic
effectonmesenchymalstemcells,andthuscouldbeusedinthefieldofregenerative
medicinetoimprovegraftingandtissuerepair(Varanietal.2021).
15.2.3 Pulsed Radiofrequency Fields (PRFs)
Pulsed radiofrequency field (PRF) therapy refers to a technique where radio fre-
quency oscillations are generated at a defined rate of pulses per second with
frequencies ranging from 1.0 × 104 to 3.0 × 1011 Hz. Therapeutically, PRFs offer
an alternative to continuous radiofrequency (CRF) therapy, which has been used
since the 1970s and offers the advantage of pain control without tissue destruction
(Byrd and Mackey 2008). These therapies typically utilize frequencies between
300 and 750 kHz, are now delivered to precise locations in the body by catheter,
and as mentioned, are used in two primary modalities: in continuous mode, these
devices are designed to produce deep heat, while in pulsed (non-thermal) mode,
which uses short (e.g., 20 ms) high-voltage bursts followed by a longer (e.g.,
480 ms) silent phase to allow for heat dissipation, they are used for soft tissue

--- Page 409 ---

400 P.EplerandK.J.Yarema
stimulation (Markov 2014).ThermalPRF(i.e., CFR) therapy delivers highcurrent
focally to ablate the tissue of interest (e.g., a tumor or cardiac tissues that trigger
arrhythmias) by heating to temperatures of 60–80 °C, resulting in focal tissue
destruction(ByrdandMackey2008).
ItremainscontroversialwhethernonthermalPRFtrulyavoids biological effects
duetoheating;forexample,althoughtemperaturesstayatorbelow42°Cminimiz-
ing cell death or tissue destruction, heat shock response nonetheless could be
triggered. Resolving this ambiguity will ultimately be necessary to fully define the
biochemical mechanism of therapeutic responses associated with PRF therapy.
Despite uncertainty over mechanism (and even efficacy), PRF is being used to
treat a growinglistof indications which are typically orientedtowardamelioration
ofpain,includingaxialpain,radicularpain,facialpain,inguinalpainandorchialgia,
andmiscellaneouspainsyndromes(ByrdandMackey2008).
15.2.4 Transcranial Magnetic/Electric Stimulation (TMS)
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) involves applying very short magnetic
pulsesofupto8Teslatoselectedportionsofthebrain(Markov2014).DuringTMS,
amagneticfieldgeneratorisplacedinproximitytotheheadofthepersonreceiving
thetreatment(Groppaetal.2012).Thecoilproduceselectriccurrentsintheregion
ofthebrainjustunderthecoilthroughelectromagneticinduction.TMScanbeused
to diagnose connections between the brain and a muscle to evaluate damage from
severalindications, including stroke,multiplesclerosis,amyotrophiclateral sclero-
sis,movementdisorders,motorneurondisease,andinjuries(Groppaetal.2012).
Therapeutically, TMS has been evaluated for conditions such as movement
disorders, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, con-
sciousness disorders, tinnitus, depression, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive
disorder,schizophrenia,craving/addiction,andmotorconversion(Lefaucheuretal.
2014).Inparticular,morerecentfindingscontinuetosupportthetherapeuticbenefit
of TMS as an option for otherwise treatment-resistant depression (Garnaat et al.
2018)anddepressioninadolescents(CroarkinandMacMaster2018).Additionally,
a2019studybyPhilipandcoworkersindicatedthatoneformofTMS,intermittent
theta-burst stimulation (iTBS), is likely to be effective for the treatment of post-
traumaticstressdisorder(Philipetal.2019).Asof2020,TMShasbeenapprovedas
atherapeuticmethodforthetreatmentoftwopsychiatricdisorders:majordepressive
disorderandobsessive-compulsivedisorder,withapprovalbytheFDAin2008and
2018,respectively(Iglesias2020).
In a 2020 review, Lefaucheur and coauthors concluded that there is sufficient
evidence to accept “definite efficacy” for the analgesic effect of high-frequency
(HF) TMS of the primary motor cortex (M1) contralateral to the pain, the antide-
pressant effect of HF-TMS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and
LF-TMSofcontralesionalM1inpost-acutestroke.“Probableefficacy”isproposed
for several indications, including but not limited to the antidepressant effect of

--- Page 410 ---

15 Prospects,Pitfalls,andOpportunitiesforHumanStaticMagneticFieldTherapy 401
low-frequency (LF) TMS of the right DLPFC (as well as the left for Parkinson’s
disease patients specifically), HF-TMS of the left DLPFC for the treatment of
fibromyalgia pain, HF-TMS of bilateral M1 regions for motor impairment, and
iTBS to treat spasticity in multiple sclerosis patients. Finally, TMS achieves “pos-
sible efficacy” in a number of indications, including LF-TMS of the left
temporoparietalcortexforauditory-verbalhallucinationsandoftheauditorycortex
forchronictinnitus(Lefaucheuretal.2014).
15.2.5 Static/Permanent Magnetic Fields (SMF)
Static magnetic fields—that is, time-invariant magnetic fields—are a feature of
various permanent magnets; alternatively, they can be generated by passing direct
current(DC)throughacoil(Markov2014).Thesefieldsaretheprimaryfocusofthis
book,withdetaileddescriptionoftheunderlyingphysicsprovidedelsewhere;inthis
chapter, SMFs will be discussed based on their field strengths with Sect. 15.3.1
coveringweakfieldsintherangeoftheEarth’smagneticfield(<0.65gaussor~65
μT).Section15.3.2willdiscusstheabsenceofthesefields,whichbydefaultmakea
convincing case that humans can detect and (subconsciously) respond to weak
magnetic fields. Finally, Sect. 15.3.3 will provide an overview of the therapeutic
use of more powerful moderate strength fields that range up to ~1 T (one Tesla or
10,000gauss).StrongfieldsaboveoneTeslaarerarelyusedinmagnetotherapyper
se, but people are exposed to these field strengths during magnetic resonance
imaging(MRI),generallywithoutanydiscernibleimpactonhealth.
15.2.6 “Non-therapeutic” Electromagnetic Field (EMF)
Exposure Allays Safety Concerns
Over the past century or so, humans have been increasingly subject to inadvertent
exposurefromman-madeEMFs.Forexample,theriseofmetalindustries,welding
processes, and certain electrified train systems in the late nineteenth centuries
resulted in significant exposure for workers and even bystanders to SMFs; in
1921,DrinkerandThomsonaskedthequestion“Doesthemagneticfieldconstitute
an industrial hazard?” and concluded that it didn’t (Hartwig et al. 2009). Over the
yearsasnew“EMF”-basedthreatshaveemerged(TuckerandSchmitt1978),suchas
living under high-voltage power lines or the ubiquitous adoption of cell phones,
whichhaveraisedfearsofchildhoodandbraincancers,havebeenmetwithdetailed
scrutinythathaveruledoutclear-cutevidenceofharm.Ultimatelymeta-analysisof
many such studies has cast doubt on the idea that EMF exposure causes any
measurabledetrimenttohumanhealth,actingasahelpfulbaselineforestablishing
the safety of magnetotherapy. On the other hand, the (general) lack of deleterious

effect of EMFs has also been used to cast doubt on whether beneficial effects are
possibleaswell,basedontheassumptionthatthesefieldslikelyhavenomeaningful
impact on human health; a substantial portion of this chapter either directly or
indirectlyaddressesthisfallacy.
15.3 Biomedical Effects of Static Magnetic Field Therapies
Categorized by Field Strength
15.3.1 “DIY” Treatments with Low to Moderate Strength
Static Magnetic Fields Are Widespread But Unproven
The largest segment of extant “magnetic therapies” falls into the do-it-yourself
(DIY) category, where individuals use various types of permanent magnets that
providecontinuousSMFexposure.Thismodalityofmagnetotherapyisusedtotreat
awiderangeofailments,withaquickinternetsearch(conductedinJanuary,2017,
but similar results have been obtained for at least 20 years) including magnetic

IntuitionalonemakesapowerfulcasethatmanyDIYmagnetotherapyeffortsare
likely misguided and minimally effective. Even if the magnets used are “high-
quality”(e.g.,constructedfromlatestneodymium-basedalloys)asadvertised,with
fieldstrengthsreported intherangeoftenstohundredsgauss(i.e.,uptwotothree

whodescribeshowtheterm“magnetictherapy”isamisnomer.Instead,heempha-
sizes that the therapeutic effects of magnets emanate from the fields they generate
and the subsequent interaction of these fields with the target tissue or organ in a
person(notethattheuseofthe“magnetotherapy”inthischapterimplicitlydenotes
magnetic field therapy). In this regard, it is critical to note that field strength
decreasesexponentially with distancefromthesurfaceofapermanent magnet(for

rangeofhundredsofgauss),andtherefore,fieldstrengthisnegligibleindeeptissue
that would need to be penetrated to have an effect on many of the conditions
purportedlytreatedwithmagnetotherapy.
One example of this pitfall is provided by a report where commercial magnetic
wraps had no effect on blood circulation in horses (Steyn et al. 2000) or pain
perception in people (Kuipers et al. 2007), which—because the field strengths
used did not penetrate effectively into tissue to the depth where the target vessels

be as little as 1 gauss only1 or 2 cm away from the magnet’s surface. As a result,
determination of dose—a key parameter in determining medical efficacy—is typi-
callyimpossibletodeterminewithanydegreeofaccuracyinDIY magnetotherapy
(Markov2009).
15.3.2 Hypomagnetic Fields (HMF)—Evidence
for Magnetotherapy by Default?
Interestingly, the impact of weak to moderately strong SMF on human health
perhapshasbeendemonstratedmostconvincinglybydefault;thatis,byobserving
the effects of the absence of geomagnetic-strength magnetic fields. These studies
haveexploitedacenturyofeffortstodevelopmaterialsdesignedtoshieldsensitive
equipmentfrommagneticfields,suchassubmarinetelegraphcables,electricpower
transformers,cathoderaytubes,andmagneticphonographcartridges.Toachievethe
required shielding, “mu-metals” have been developed that have a representative

In the past few years, a provocative set of experimental results have emerged,
indicating that HMF has numerous biological and biomedical effects across

species—including humans. For example, long-term HMF exposure is associated
withembryonicmalformationininsects(Wanetal.2014),amphibians[e.g.,newts

(Baek et al. 2019). Additional effects of HMF have been described in rodents,

adrenaline release (Choleris et al. 2002; Zhang et al. 2007), and impairment of
learningandneurogenesisinthehippocampus(Zhangetal.2021).Learningdefects
have been described in birds (Xu et al. 2003) and Drosophila (Zhang et al. 2004).
Finally,thenegativeimpact ofHMF hasbeen reported toextend tohumans; these
effectshaveoftenandmostconvincinglybeendeducedfromspaceflight,wherethe
geomagnetic field is negligible in strength because it is generally not practical to
confine a person to an artificially shielded HMF area. These studies have shown
HMFeffectsinhumansthatincludeperturbedcircadianrhythms(Wever1970;Bliss
andHeppner1976)andweakenedcognitivefunction(BinhiandSarimov2009).
The generally deleterious effects of HMF across several biological processes in
manyspecies,includingthestill-speculativebutneverthelessplausibleobservations
inpeople,havestrengthenedthecasethat weak magnetic fields dohave legitimate
biomedical relevance. For example, it appears that GMFs keep us healthy and
contribute to normal physiology. Extrapolating from these observations, it has
beenhypothesizedthatbecausealackofmagneticfieldsisharmful,fieldstrengths

drugs, such as aspirin or the antioxidant resveratrol, must be consumed at much
higher levels to have a medical effect than a person can reasonably obtain from
natural consumption (Scott et al. 2012). Similarly, arguments have been made—
abutted with claims that humans evolved when the Earth’s magnetic field was as
muchasanorderofmagnitudestrongerthanitistoday—theearth’smagneticfieldis
constantly waxing and waning, and even reverses polarity on a millions-of-years
time scale (Mori et al. 2013), an event associated with mass extinctions (Lipowski
and Lipowska 2006)—that to achieve maximum benefits from magnetotherapy,
strongermagneticfieldsshouldbeused.

15.3.3.1 ModerateStrengthStaticMagneticFieldTherapy
The benefits (or necessity) of using stronger than GMF-strength fields for human
therapyhavespurredeffortstousestaticmagneticfieldsmuchstrongerthanafforded
naturally by today’s geomagnetic fields. In some cases, these strategies involve
“DIY” efforts with magnets in the tens to hundreds of milli-Tesla range, but, as
discussedabove,theseeffortsarelikelyineffectivefortreatmentsthatrequiredeep
penetration of tissue. As an alternative, medical devices, often from Europe, that

create stronger electromagnetic fields have been marketed. The US FDA generally
permitsthesefor“generalwellness”(Anonymous2015)whileprohibitingclaimsfor
efficacyfortreatmentofanyspecificmedicalindication.
In some cases, proponents of magnetic therapy are pursuing more rigorous
evidence of efficacy. One example is provided by continuing efforts of Joe
Kirschvink and colleagues to demonstrate that humans are affected by externally
applied magnetic field in ways that are medically relevant (Hand 2016). Another
example of moving forward with therapeutic intervention is provided by the
Advanced Magnetic Research Institute (AMRi) that has developed a “Magnetic
Molecular Energizer™” (MME) device (Bonlie 2001) capable of producing SMFs
of 0.3–0.5 T that completely penetrate the human body in an ~20 cm radius
(Fig. 15.1). Based on the assumption that the “biosensor” for magnetic reception
is located directly in the diseased or damaged tissue, a patient is positioned with
the magnetic field centered on the affected area. Double-blind clinical trials seem-
ingly showed efficacy against lower back pain (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:
NCT00325377) and possibly against symptoms of diabetic neuropathy
(ClinicalTrials.govIdentifier:NCT00134524).Theresultsofthesestudies,however,
weredifficult tointerpretbecausepositive outcomes werenotstatistically different
from placebo-treated patients, who also experienced marked improvement (Dean
Bonlie, personal communication). These clinical studies illustrate two recurring
themesineffortstoestablishclinicalefficacyformagnetotherapy; first,therapeutic
effectivenessismostwellestablishedforpainperception(thesubjectofthesetests)
and second, the placebo effect is often overwhelming in magnetotherapy; both of
thesepointsarefurtherelaboratedinSect.15.5.3,below.

MRI workers (Evans et al. 1993). It should be noted that these reports dealt with

safety standards have been tightened and follow-up and continuing problems have
notbeenreported.
15.4 Prospects for Therapeutic Areas
Magnetotherapy has been applied to almost any imaginable human ailment. For
example, MedicineNet (http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?
articlekey=22961) summarizes conditions claimed to be diagnosed or treated
using magnetic field therapy (largely through the “DIY” methods mentioned
above)toincludearthritis,cancer,circulatorydisorders,diabeticneuropathy,fibro-
myalgia,HIV/AIDS,immunedysfunction,infection,inflammation,insomnia,mul-
tiple sclerosis, muscle pain, neuropathy, pain, rheumatoid arthritis, sciatica, and
stress, as well as to increase energy and prolong life. The above-mentioned AMRi
Corporation, which utilizes stronger strength SMF therapy, is investigating the
treatmentofailmentsthatrangefromspinalcordinjury,braininjury,strokeimpair-
ment, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, Parkinson’s disease,
Alzheimer’s disease, congestive heart failure, to orthopedic conditions involving
boneandjointrepair.AsdescribedinSect.15.5below,manyfinditimplausiblethat
a“onesizefitsall”treatmentcouldbeeffectiveagainstsomanyindications,andthis
doubt in part contributes to disbelief in therapeutic efficacy for magnetic field
exposure. However, as discussed next, pain perception, blood flow, and effects on
thecardiovascularsystem,aswellastheimpactonstemcellsandcellsfoundinthe
neurological system, provide a compelling scientific basis for beneficial effects of
SMFs that, if carefully and rigorously translated to the clinic, hold legitimate
promiseforhumantherapy.
15.4.1 Pain Perception
A substantial body of evidence has accumulated showing that exposure to EMFs
affects pain sensitivity (nociception) and pain inhibition (analgesia); in particular,
acuteexposuretovariousEMFshasbeenshowntoinhibitanalgesiainmanystudies
(Del Seppia et al. 2007). In some studies, however, depending on the duration,
intensity,frequency,andrepeatednatureofEMFexposure,increasedanalgesiahas
actually been observed (Del Seppia et al. 2007). While many of these studies—
conducted in diverse organisms ranging from snails to mice to people—have
involvedtime-varyingfields,thereisalsosubstantialevidencethatSMFscanaffect
pain perception. These findings have most convincingly come from HMF studies
where mice apparently detect and respond to the absence of the ambient geomag-
neticfield.
Inapioneeringstudy,miceexperiencedamaximumanalgesicresponseafter4–6
days of exposure (Prato et al. 2005). Follow-up studies showed a more complex

increasepeakingbythefifthday,withareturntopre-exposurevalueswithin8days
(DelSeppiaetal.2007).Interestingly,thekineticsofthisresponseroughlymirroran
in vitro cell-based assay response to moderate strength SMF (Wang et al. 2009)
describedin more detailbelow in Sect. 15.4.3.It was found more recentlythat the
application of transcranial static magnetic field stimulation (tSMS) to the primary
motor cortex (M1) and primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of humans may affect
cortical processing of pain, making this a possible noninvasive method for the
treatment of chronic pain alongside other standard-of-care treatments (Kirimoto
etal.2018).
15.4.2 Blood Flow/Vascularization
As discussed in more detail in Chap. 4, beneficial effects of magnetotherapy in
humans often have been attributed to improved blood flow. Although many of the
Internetclaimsinthisregardarenonsensical—forexample,theideathatamagnetic
fieldattractstheironinthebloodisbasedonthemisconceptionthathemoglobinis
ferromagnetic.Instead,ironinoxygenatedbloodisdiamagnetic,whichmeansthere
is a real but almost negligible force repelling the blood; on the other hand, deoxy-
genated blood is paramagnetic, which means there will be a similarly almost
negligible force attracting the blood (Zborowski et al. 2003). Either way, these
effects are dwarfed by thermal motion and the ambient flow of the blood
(asdiscussedinmoredetailinChap.4).
Nevertheless, there is evidence—although inconclusive because of many
conflicting orinconclusive studies—that magnetic fields canlegitimately modulate
bloodflowinhumans(orothermammals).Asanaside,somenegativeresultscanbe
accountedforbythetrivialexplanationthatthemagneticfieldsusedwerenotstrong
enoughtopenetratedeeplyintothetissuewherethetargetbloodvesselswereused.
One example with horses was mentioned above (Steyn et al. 2000). Similarly, a
study using 500 gauss (0.05 T) fields to measure blood flow in the forearms of
healthyyoungmenwasequallyineffective(Marteletal.2002);thisisnotsurprising
because field strength would be two to three orders of magnitude lower at the
location of the targeted blood vessels embedded in tissue. A ~tenfold larger field
(4042 gauss, or ~0.4 T), by contrast, did statistically affect blood flow in treated
fingers (Mayrovitz and Groseclose 2005); interestingly, this effect was actually a
reductioninbloodflow,conversetowhatisgenerallythoughttobetherapeutically
beneficial.
A set of studies in rabbits using similar strength fields (i.e., ~0.18–0.25 T) also
showed legitimate effects of SMFs on blood flow (Xu et al. 1998; Okano and
Ohkubo 2001; Gmitrov et al. 2002). These three studies demonstrated a biphasic
responseofbloodflowwhereexposureenhancedvasodilationwhenthevesselswere

15 Prospects,Pitfalls,andOpportunitiesforHumanStaticMagneticFieldTherapy 409
vasoconstricted and enhanced vasoconstriction in vessels that were vasodilated; in
other words, the SMFs appeared to work to maintain circulatory homeostasis and
“normalize” vascular function. A conceptually similar normalization effect was
observed in mice where the impact of surgical intervention that would otherwise
causeluminaldiameterexpansioninvascularnetworkswasabrogatedbycontinual
exposuretoSMFsover4–7days(MorrisandSkalak2007).Together,thesestudies
suggest that while SMF exposure does have an interesting effect on blood flow, it
likely is not mediated through magnetic or inductive effects on iron containing
molecules(hemoglobin)orcells(RBCs)perse.
Instead,therapeuticeffectsonbloodflowarelikelymediatedby“non-canonical”
mechanisms(i.e.,notmagnetite,chemomagneticsensing,orinductivemechanisms,
whicharethethreemolecularmechanismsfoundthroughoutnatureinmanydiverse
organisms, as discussed in detail in Chap. 4). Another interesting feature of these
studies is that field strengths of greater than ~0.1 T (1000 gauss) were needed for
efficacy; as mentioned, the simple explanation is that weaker field strengths could
notpenetratedeeplyenoughintotissuetoreachtheintendedsiteofaction(i.e.,the
bloodvesselsthemselves).Anotherexplanation(againasdiscussedinmoredetailin
Chap.4)isthatfieldstrengthsof~0.2Torhighercanalterthebiophysicalproperties
of lipid assemblies (Braganza et al. 1984). As a result, the properties of lipid
biolayers (i.e., biological membranes) are affected in ways that putatively explain
many phenomena observed in magnetotherapy. For example, changes in ion flux
could reasonably be explained by allosteric changes to ionchannels brought about
changes to the biophysical properties of membranes, rather than the less plausible
explanation that SMF directly affects the movement of ions (i.e., through an
inductive or “Hall effect,” which has sometimes been postulated to explain the
mechanism of magnetotherapy). Similarly, changes to signal pathway activity can
beexplainedbytheeffectsofmagneticfieldexposureonthebiophysicalproperties
ofmembranes,asdiscussedbelowforneuralcells.Bothofthesetopicsarediscussed
inthenextsectioninthecontextofstudiesperformedintheauthor’slaboratory.
Inadditiontoaffectingbloodflow,somestudieshaveshownthatSMFcanplaya

with a nanocomposite scaffold. For example, a 2016 study indicated that murine
osteoblasts stimulated by a combination of SMF and magnetic nanoparticle scaf-
foldingpromotedangiogenesisinendothelialcells,predominantlyindicatedbythe
expressionofangiogenesis-relatedgenesandtheformationofcapillarytubes(Yun
et al. 2016). Another, later, study showed that tissues were vascularized more
quickly in cell-containing nanocomposite hydrogels when those hydrogels were
exposed to SMF, suggesting that SMF has a vasculogenic effect on engineered
bone grafts (Filippi et al. 2019). Even more recently, it was found that exosomes
derivedfrombonemesenchymalstemcellsstimulatedwithmagneticnanoparticles
and SMF can promote angiogenesis and improve wound healing (Wu et al. 2020,
2021).

Because IL-6 guides differentiation of neural stem cells primarily to astrocytes
(Taga and Fukuda 2006)—which is generally a medically unwanted outcome
because hyperproliferation of this cell type leads to scar formation rather than
regeneration—we investigated whether evidence of astrocytogenesis was seen in
SMF-treated cells. Interestingly, responses consistent with astrocyte differentiation
(i.e.,slowedproliferationandmorphologicalchanges)expectedfromIL-6exposure
were not seen; neither were biochemical markers of astrocyte differentiation
(Fig. 15.2a). Instead, markers found in neurons (Fig. 15.2b) and oligodendrocytes

conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS) that are linked to oligodendrocyte

However, SMF in this same intensity range can also have a negative impact on
astrocytes, adversely affecting their viability and decreasing their mitochondrial
function(daCostaetal.2021).ExamplesofresearchintoSMFspecificallyforthe

that demonstrated a reduction in epileptiform cortical activity in both a rat and
monkey (Rivadulla et al. 2018), and a slightly earlier study by Dileone et al. that
indicates that SMF modulates cortical activity in a dopamine-dependent mannerin
Parkinson’sdiseasepatients(Dileoneetal.2017).
15.4.4 Stem Cells
One of the most notable recent developments in the study of biological SMF
application is the usage of SMF for stem cell engineering, in which SMF is used
as a method of regulating stem cell fate. This emerging application for SMF has

particularlybeenusedforchondrogenic,osteogenic,andadipogenicstemcells,and
it has been speculated that SMF can be used to induce synthesis and secretion of
extracellular microvesicles from stem cells for regenerative medicine as well
(Marycz et al. 2018). For example, it has been shown that bone mesenchymal
stemcellsstimulatedwithmagneticnanoparticlesandSMFcanproduceexosomes
that promote both osteogenesis and angiogenesis (Wu et al. 2021). Human mesen-

For example, moderate-intensity SMF has been found to improve proliferative

century to understand how to fully exploit aspirin as a medicine; indeed, some
aspects of this drug remain poorly understood. For example, at a pharmacological

However, much is known about some aspects of aspirin, including the impact of

pitfalls—and lessons to be learned—for magnetic field therapy. Aspirin, if tested

the contrary, careful compiling of conditions that do not work could be extremely
helpful in guiding treatments toward diseases and other ailments where the
magnetotherapydoeswork.
Unfortunately, the efficacy of magnetic therapy has been clouded by ambiguity
that results in large part from study design, as illustrated by a review of over
50studiesapproximatelyadecadeago(Colbertetal.2007,2009).Inthesestudies,
onlytwoprovidedsufficientlydetailedexperimentalprotocolstoactuallyreproduce
the work; although a more recent systematically analyzed compilation of studies
does not appear to be available, anecdotal perusal of the literature over the past
decadesuggeststhattheproblemofincompletereportingofexperimentalconditions
persists up to today. As Markov forcefully editorializes, until parameters used in
magnetic field therapy—starting at a very basic terminology level to overcome
confusion over semantic differences between “magnetic therapy” and “magnetic
fieldtherapy”(i.e.,magnetsthemselveshavenotherapeuticeffectbutthefieldsthey

by the mainstream scientific and medical communities (Markov 2009). Indeed,
Markov (and his colleagues) have been trying to educate about these issues for at
least two decades, and in that vein, has proposed a set of parameters that must be

15.5.2 Parameters Necessary to be Controlled

The variety of commercially available EMF devices—often with poorly character-
ized and sometimes misrepresented field strength specifications—makes it difficult
tocomparethephysicalandengineeringcharacteristicsofanyparticulardeviceused
in any reported study, thus providing significant obstacles for analysis of clinical
efficacy. Markov outlines a set of parameters that must be controlled, defined, and

15.5.3 The Placebo Effect
As already alluded to above, pain response was the only medical outcome where
magneticfieldsunambiguouslyhadabeneficialtherapeuticeffect,basedonthebulk
of the literature reviewed by Del Seppia and coauthors a decade ago (Del Seppia
etal.2007).Manyoftherelevantstudieswereperformedinanimals,oftenrodents,
where there presumably is no placebo effect, but in humans, the placebo response
cannot be discounted soeasily. Indeed, difficulties in establishing benefits ofmag-
netictherapyresultinpartfromdesigningexperimentsthataccountfortheplacebo

Interestingly—andperhaps unsurprisingly—alarge placeboeffect wasobservedin
these studies that plausibly can be explained by the belief of control subjects that
theywereundergoinglegitimateSMFexposure.
The placebo effect—evidenced by sham-treated test subjects experiencing
improvementtolong-standingconditions(lowerbackpainanddiabeticneuropathy)
that were not responsive to conventional medical treatment at rates comparable to
SMF-treatedindividuals—illustratesthegrowing realization thatplacebotreatment
isnotequivalentto“notreatment.”Briefly,placeboeffect dependsonbeliefinthe
effectiveness of the treatment; in fact, the opposite “nocebo” effect has been
proposedwhereapatientwhodisbelievesinatreatmentmayexperienceaworsening
ofsymptoms(Kennedy1961).Ofnote,“belief”isaratherambiguousconcept,but
cantheoreticallybeconvertedintophysiologicalmodulationthroughopioidneuro-
transmitterswhoseendogenousproductioniscontrolledbythebrain.
The placebo effect can be powerful, with attempts to objectively measure its
contribution to medical intervention overall ranging from 30 to 40% of overall
observed effects of a medicine. The impact of the placebo effect varies among
treatment modalities and disease conditions, with one of the stronger responses
reported for the effects of antitussive medicines in patients with acute upper respi-
ratorytractinfections.Inthesepatients,85%ofthereductionincoughingwaslinked
to the placebo effect, whereas only 15% was linked to the actual physiological
effects of the pharmacological agents (Eccles 2002). It appears that the placebo
effectmightbeequallypervasiveandinfluentialinresponsetoSMFtreatmentsand,
inalessonbeinglearnedfrompsychiatry (Horgan 2013),thefieldshouldconsider
embracing—ratherthanbeingembarrassedby—thisaspectofmagnetotherapy.
15.6 Concluding Comments
This chapter describes various modes of EMF therapy, with the main focus on
SMFs. Up to now, this therapeutic modality has both shown promise and been
downplayed, in part due to over-enthusiastic claims by its practitioners. Accord-
ingly, strict guidelines have been proposed to maintain “quality control” when
patients are being treated with magnetotherapy in efforts to rigorously establish
efficacy against specific medical indications, several of which are mentioned and
described in some detail (e.g., pain perception and management, blood flow and
vascularization, neurological regeneration, and stem cell differentiation in
Sect.15.4).
