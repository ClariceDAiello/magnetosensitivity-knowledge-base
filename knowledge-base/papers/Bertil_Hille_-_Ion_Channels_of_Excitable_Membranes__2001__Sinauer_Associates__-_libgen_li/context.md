## Abstract

nature of their writing, Cole and Cur­
tis's attempts to describe the membrane as a linear circuit element and their cau­
tion in offering any interpretation kept them from thinking about which ions par­
ticipated in the conductance increase.
Just as most features of Bernstein's theory seemed confirmed, another impor­
tant discrepancy with the idea of membrane breakdown was found. For the first
time, Hodgkin and Huxley (1939, 1945) and Curtis and Cole (1940, 1942) were
able to measure the full action potential of an axon with an intracellular micro-
pipette. They had expected to observe a transient drop of membrane potential to
near 0 mV as the membrane became transiently permeable to all ions. Instead, EM
overshot zero and reversed sign by tens of millivolts (Figure 2.1).
