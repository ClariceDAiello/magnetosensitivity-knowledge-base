## Abstract

biological activity of catholyte was
associated with a reduced, rather than enhanced, content of protons in water,
whereas the other catholyte characteristics, such as pH and dissolved molecular
hydrogen, correspond to those of reduced water (Shirahata et al., 1997). It is not
clear what has caused this discrepancy. One cannot measure the concentration
of atomic hydrogenin a direct experiment; no relevantexperimentalmethods have
beenreported.Unlikemolecularhydrogen,activehydrogencannotbeimaginedasa

of intense proton exchange, atomic hydrogen is closely interwoven in the net of
hydrogen bonds to become an integral entity of this net and the water medium.
