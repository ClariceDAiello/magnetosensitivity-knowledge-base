Prologue
Why magnetic fields modify chemistry and biology?
Spinistheangularmomentumofelectronasaquantumtop;nuclearspinisthe
angular momentum of magnetic nucleus. Chemistry is a Kingdom reigned by
Queen,theenergy,andKing,angularmomentum.TheQueenrulesgraciously:
if there is not enough energy, the reacting species overcome energy barrier
underthebarrierbyquantumtunneling.TheKingrulescruelly:allmolecular
processes are spin selective; they are allowed only for those spin states of
reactants, whose total spin is identical to that of products. Conservation of
angular momentum (electron spin) is a fundamental and universal principle.
Magneticinteractionsaretheonlyones,whichareabletochangeelectron
spin of reactants and switch over the processes between spin-forbidden and
spin-allowed channels, controlling pathways and chemical reactivity in mo-
lecular processes. Spin chemistry is the science of controlling spin by mag-
neticfields:thepermanentexternalfields,theinternalfieldofmagneticnuclei,
and electromagnetic fields. Contributing almost nothing into the total energy,
being negligibly small, magnetic interactions control physical, chemical, and
biochemical processes. Spin chemistry is in fact chemistry under magnetic
control. Two major discoveries certified its foundation: the discovery of nu-
clearpolarization,inducedbychemicalreactions(1967),andthediscoveryof
the magnetic isotope effect (1976). Spin biology inherits the magnetic effects
created by spin chemistry in enzymatic reactions and reproduces them at the
cellularlevelandinwholeorganisms.Spinbiologyisinfactmagneto-biology
and spin genetics is indeed magneto-genetics.
Amongthemanyfactors,controllingchemicalreactions,magneticfieldsas
a means to accelerate or retard the reactions are the most intriguing; for this
reason, the term magnetic catalysis is further used on a par with magnetic
control.Magneticcatalysisimpliesaregulationofmolecularprocessesbyany
magnetic fields. It is a magic catalysis; it needs neither homogeneous, nor
heterogeneous catalysts. It is catalysis by interactions induced by magnetic
nuclei, magnetic fields, and electromagnetic irradiation. It exhibits itself in
many remarkable, highly important and useful phenomena:
l It is a universal means to detect and elucidate chemical mechanisms of
reactions, to discriminate reactions occurring with participation of para-
magnetic intermediate species and finally to control reaction routes.

technology.

Chapter 1
How magnetic fields modify
chemistry and biochemistry
1.1 Radical pair mechanism of the magnetic control
Magnetic fields, both external and internal, induced by magnetic nuclei,
modify chemical reactivity, producing new phenomena and effects. The
two facets of magnetic control are most important. First, it discloses the
new properties of chemical reactions, it brings new comprehension of
molecular mechanisms and an understanding of how to deliberately tune
them for certain targets. Second, it introduces new ideas and technologies
in molecular biology and genetics, which open new frontiers in medical
applications.
The simplest and most extended in chemistry and biochemistry example
fortheillustrationofmagneticcontrolistheradicalpair[R(cid:1)(cid:1)R]asaprecursor
of the radical recombination or disproportionation products. Only the singlet
state of the pair with spin S¼0 is open for the reaction and generates
diamagnetic molecule RR; the triplet pairs with spin S¼1 are closed.
Spin conversion and magnetic catalysis are induced by three factors:
l Permanent external magnetic fields;
l Electromagnetic, oscillating magnetic fields;
l Nuclear magnetic fields of stable isotopes with magnetic nuclei.
The scheme below illustrates the essence of magnetic control. Three
magnetic interactions, which produce tripletesinglet spin conversion,
transform the triplet pair, in which recombination is spin forbidden, into
the reactive singlet pair, catalyzing recombination; this phenomenon cer-
tifies magnetic catalysis. These interactions specify the spin selective
mechanism, which is known in chemistry as the radical pair mechanism
(RPM).

spin carriers (paramagnetic ions, triplet and high-spin molecules, trapped
electrons, paramagnetic holes, vacancies and dislocations in solids, etc.) is a
multispinsystemwithmanifoldspinstates.Chemicalreactionselectsthoseof
them that do not need spin changes to give products; others are not able to
react. For example, the chemical addition of radical to a triplet molecule
(oxygen, for instance), as well as the physical quenching of excited triplet
molecule by radical, results in products in a doublet spin state:
D
( R O ) RO

R + O .

The precursor of the reaction is a three-spin pair (R(cid:1) O ) in doublet D or
2
quartet Q spin states. Only the doublet state is open for the addition reaction;
the quartet state is forbidden because it requires spin conversion. Similarly,

alsospinselective:itisallowedonlyinthedoubletstateandforbiddeninthe

The first reaction is allowed only in the singlet state of the pair because it
generates a diamagnetic peroxide molecule in the singlet state (spin S¼0).
Thesecondreactiongeneratesoxygenmoleculesinatripletstate;itisallowed
only in triplet pairs. Three mentioned above magnetic interactions, which
produce tripletesinglet spin conversion, control chemical reactivity and re-
action rates, producing magnetic effects. By the way, the above-mentioned
reactions are important in the oxidation by molecular oxygen and they were
shown to be indeed magnetic field dependent (Chapter 2).
Inthereactionoftwotriplets(recombinationoftripletcarbines,additionof
oxygen to triplet molecule, delayed fluorescence from annihilation of two
triplets,etc.)theprecursoroftheproductisapairwithninespinstates:oneof
them is a singlet (S¼0), three states belong to triplet (S¼1), and fivestates
are quintets (S¼2). Only one of the nine available spin states of the pair is
allowedtoreactresultinginaproductinasingletspinstate;allothersarespin
forbidden. Thus, an annihilation of the two triplets populates only the singlet
state of the excited molecule; the other eight channels are spin forbidden and
do not result in delayed fluorescence. The great number of reactions with the
participation of radicals, ion radicals, paramagnetic metal ions, carbines, and
molecules (such as NO, O ) are spin selective; chemical reactivity of the re-

magnetic fields.
Magnetic control of spin is a means to switch over the reactions between
spin-allowed and spin-forbidden channelsdit is a spin control of chemical
reactions, the subject of spin chemistry, which investigates the behavior of
electron and nuclear spins in reactions and develops new principles and
techniques to control chemical reactivity by spin manipulation [1e5].

effects even if the RPM is certainly known to function; they are discussed in
Chapter 5. This mechanism is an ingenious and universal key concept for
understanding magnetic effects in physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and
environmental sciences [6,7].

1.4 Spin is a main actor in magnetobiology
Magnetic effects on molecular motion, on the orientation and conformational
rearrangements,onthepullingandtuggingofmoleculesandmoleculargroups
orfragments,andontheperturbationofmembranesandionicchannelsareof
minor importance and may be ignored because the energy of magnetic in-
teractionsisnegligiblysmall,by5e10logarithmicunitslessthanthethermal
energy kT, that is, magnetic forces are much less than the forces induced by
intermolecularelectricpotentialsinheatmolecularcollisions;thisstatementis
well founded and firmly substantiated (see, for instance Refs. [8,9]). It
unambiguously means that the origin of magneto-biological effects is hidden
in chemistry, in chemical events.

8 MagneticEffects
Chemistry is not the whole life, but all life is totally chemistry. Magnetic
control in biology is a universal phenomenon; there are thousands of papers
that reliably demonstrate magnetic effects in biology and medicine; some of
them are summarized in recent reviews and monographs [9e14]. Magnetic
effects were exhibited in neurophysiology [15], in the immune [16] and
circadian systems [17], in microbiology [18e20], and even in the storage of
fruits [21] and improved germination of seeds [22]; these effects will be dis-
cussed in Chapters 5e9.

Magnetic catalysis of liquid
phase reactions
2.1 Magnetic catalysis by external magnetic field
Magnetic field was shown to influence the rates and competition of many
reactionsinwhich triplet molecules,radicals, andionradicals participate;the
results of the earlier studies were summarized in many papers and books
[1e6].Amongthelateststudies,theeffectsofmagneticfieldontheoxidation
processes, which arewell known to be important both in industry and nature,
are worthy of attention; we will consider them in detail as an illustration of
how to use magnetic field effects as a research technology.
The most general and universal oxidation mechanism is the chain
mechanism, which includes radicals as the spin carriers and, therefore, im-
plies spin-selective and magnetosensitive steps. The first case, when both
magnetic field and nuclear magnetic 17O effects were detected, was the
photo-oxidationofwaterbymolecularoxygen[7];thisprocessisimpliedto
be of global importance for the monitoring of the oxygen turnover in nature
(see Chapter 4).
The oxidation of hydrocarbons by molecular oxygen, in which chain car-
riers are alkyl R and peroxy RO radicals, is thought to also contribute to the
2
oxygen turnover. The chain oxidation by molecular oxygen is known [8] to
occur as a sequence of initiation, propagation, and termination steps:

Magnetic field effect is defined as the ratio of the oxidation rate in mag-
netic field W(H) to that in Earth magnetic field W(0): ME¼W(H)/W(0); as
shown in Fig. 2.1 magnetic field (0.3e0.4T) accelerates by 10%e70% the
oxidation of styrene and ethyl benzene by molecular oxygen [8].
The effects were consistently explained in terms of triplet-singlet spin
conversion in radical pairs [Rl lR] and [Rl lO
2
R] because the magnetic field
switches off hyperfine coupling and decreases the rate of the chain termina-
tion.Thiseffectmaybeusedasameanstoelucidatemechanismsofoxidation

The effect on this reaction follows from the quartet-doublet, Q(cid:3)D, spin
conversion;Fig.2.3illustrateshowitoccurs.SpinsS¼1/2andS¼1belong

total spin of 3/2. However, the difference of Zeeman energies of partners in-
duces different rates of their spin precession resulting to their dephasing into
the doublet state, in which spins are directed oppositely. The change of spin
transforms the quartet state, forbidden for the reaction, into the doublet state
opening the reaction channel to generate peroxy radical RO 2l.
Being magneto-sensitive, this reaction is also sensitive to the nuclear
magnetic field and fractionates magnetic 17O and nonmagnetic (16O, 18O)
isotopes (see Chapter 4).

methyl-linoleate and methyl-oleate, the molecules with conjugated double
bonds, which are known to be weakly bound and easily removed by radical
attack of hydrogen atoms in the CH group located between the double

In strict contrast with saturated compounds the MFE for unsaturated
molecules exhibits itself only in high fields H(cid:4)0.4T (typical example is
shown in Fig. 2.4).
The difference of the MFE for the two sorts of substrates, saturated and

is supposed to be a dominating reaction, which generates biradical [lCe
COOl]T (2) in a triplet spin state. By definition, the rate of initiation is the
radical release from the primary pair 1 or biradical 2; it competes with
intracage reactions, which are the source of MFE.
In the pair 1, the two reactions may occur, recombination and
disproportionation:
The first reaction is spin forbidden and needs spin conversion from triplet
state T into the singlet S. Spin conversion is induced by the difference in
ZeemanenergiesDgbH,whereDgisthedifferenceofg-factorsofpartners;so
that the magnetic field accelerates recombination decreasing the rate of initi-
ation. On the contrary, the second reaction is spin allowed because it re-
generates triplet oxygen; the magnetic field stimulates spin conversion from
triplet state T into the singlet S with the rate DgbH preventing dispropor-
tionationandincreasingradicalescape,thatis,increasingtherateofinitiation.
Evidently, spin conversions in both reactions occur in opposite directions and
compensateforeachother.Finally,itresultsintheabsenceofMFEontherate
of initiation, in agreement with experimental observations (see Table 2.1).
In the initially formed biradical 2 [lOOC(cid:3)Cl]T magnetic field stimulates
its triplet-singlet conversion; biradical 2 in singlet state collapses into the
peroxide molecule according to the scheme.
Magnetic effect starts at high field Hz0.4T (4000G), which is much
largerthananyhyperfinecouplingwithprotonsinbiradical2;itmeansthatthe

2.2 Nuclear magnetic catalysis
2.2.1 Magnetic isotope effect as the universal phenomenon
Three fundamental properties of atomic nucleidmass, spin (and related
magnetic moment), and volumedare the source of isotope effects. The most
deserved and popular, with almost a hundred-year history, is the mass-
dependent isotope effect. Magnetic isotope effect (MIE) was ingeniously
predicted in 1971 [12] and detected first time experimentally in 1976 [13]. It
is controlled by magnetic hyperfine coupling and demonstrates the depen-
dence of the reaction rates on the nuclear magnetic moments of reactants. It
fractionates isotopes by their magnetic moments rather than by their masses;
due to this property, it provides a new powerful technology of isotope frac-
tionation and a new tool for mechanistic chemistry, geo- and biochemistry,
and space chemistry; it allows tracing chemical evolution of the matter,
genesis, and chemical history of the substances in nature [14e17]. It is
recognized to be the most efficient means to elucidate Earth and environ-
mental chemistry (see Chapter 4). As the degree of isotope fractionation
dependsonthemagnitudeoftheelectron-nuclearcoupling,itmayexceedthe
mass-dependent fractionation by one or even two orders of magnitude. The
MIE is now detected for many elements (oxygen, silicon, sulfur, germanium,
tin, mercury, magnesium, calcium, zinc, and uranium) in a great variety of
chemical and biochemical reactions including those of medical importance
(Chapter 4).

2.2.2 Fractionation of magnetic and nonmagnetic isotopes
Nuclear magnetic field effects aswell asthose ofexternalmagnetic fields are
reliable, the most versatile tools, and unambiguous indicators of the reaction
mechanisms. Moreover, they are even much more important because they
execute the additional functions: first, they fractionate magnetic and
nonmagneticisotopesand,second,inmanyreactionsmagneticnucleifunction
as the nuclear catalysts or suppressors, strongly stimulating or decelerating
catalytic reactions (such as silicon oxidation, ATP and DNA synthesis).
TheobservationofMIEisanunambiguousandthemostreliableindication
of the radical mechanism of reaction; it implies the generation of radical pair
asatwo-spinsystembydissociationofmoleculesorbyelectrontransfer.MIE
is shown to function in a great variety of processes in physics and chemistry
andinbiologyandmedicine[18];itsmagnitudeisordinarybyorderofvalue
largerthanthatofclassical,mass-dependentisotopeeffect.Fig.2.6showsthat
MIE is now detected for many elements.

(with 12C in carbonyl group) is strongly delayed; this pair predominantly
dissociatesandresultsinthereactionproducts(benzylandcarbonmonoxide).
Thus, radical pair sorts nuclei and dispatches magnetic and nonmagnetic
nuclei into the different reaction products: regenerated ketone accumulates
13C,carbonmonoxidecollects12C[13].Fig.2.8showsthatafterphotolysisof
dibenzyl ketone by 80% the remaining 20% becomes enriched by 17%; it is
much larger than the mass-dependent isotope effect predicts.

the efficiency of isotope fractionation [19,20]; it was a great breakthrough in
isotope science. The efficiency of isotope sorting can also be increased by
selective and controllable microwave pumping of the radical pairs, carrying
magnetic nuclei. Microwave pumping stimulates their tripletesinglet spin
conversion, increasing recombination probability and, ultimately, the yield of
regenerated ketone enriched with 13C nuclei [21].

2.2.3 Chemically induced nuclear polarization
It was the first phenomenon, in which magnetic catalysis has been clearly
deliberated. It certifies the nuclear spin selectivity of the reactions in the
radical pair and was detected in the NMR spectra of molecules, the reaction
products, as an enhanced absorption or even emission (positive or negative
polarization). Both are evidence of the nonequilibrium population of nuclear
Zeeman levels in the newly born moleculesdoverpopulation or inverted
population, respectively.
The discovery of the phenomenon, christened as chemically induced dy-
namic nuclear polarization (CIDNP), was a great event in chemistry [23,24].
At first, it was suggested that the nonequilibrium population of nuclear Zee-
manlevelsresultsfromthenonequilibriumpopulationoftheelectronZeeman
levels in the newly born radicals as the Overhauser effect. However, the
simultaneous observation of positive and negative polarization of different
nuclei in the same molecule has driven to the deliberation that this

phenomenon is incompatible with the Overhauser effect. It was understood
that the CIDNP is a result of spin selective generation of molecules with
certainnuclearorientation(ifitisinducedbyT eSconversion),orthenuclear

polarization is created (if the generation of the molecule occurs by T(cid:3) eS or
Tþ eS conversion). In other words, the radicals with different nuclear orien-
tationsenterintothedifferentmolecules;itisindeedafractionationofnuclei
according to their orientations.
The theory of CIDNP is presented in many papers [25e28] and summa-
rized in monographs [4,6,29,30]. Till now, the CIDNP remains to be a
powerful means toelucidate thereaction mechanisms; besidesprotons,itwas
also detected for 13C and 31P [30,31].
2.2.4 Chemical maser
In the case when the upper Zeeman level in the newly born molecule is
strongly overpopulated and exceeds the threshold of generation, the chemi-
cally reacting system functions as a chemical maser (microwave analog of
laser) [32].Chemically induced invertedpopulation of nuclear Zeemanlevels

This collection of individual nuclear magnets into the summary moment

tegrated magnetic moment; the latter generates high-frequency current in the

of polarized protons in quinone molecules was created by a reversible photo-
induced reaction. Chemically induced microwave emission is a basis for
chemical radio-physics, a fascinating field of chemical physics [33].
2.3 Electron spin catalysis
Spintransformationoftheradicalpairmaybealsoinducedbythepresenceof
the third spin carrier (radical or paramagnetic ion). In such a spin triad the
pairwiseexchangeinteractionofthethirdspinwiththepartnersoftheradical
pair may produce a spin conversion in the pair, transforming nonreactive
triplet states into the spin-allowed and, therefore, chemically reactive singlet
states.Thethirdspincarriermaybeconsideredasaspincatalyzer,sothatthe
spin transformation of the radical pair in a triad may be defined as spin
catalysis. This phenomenon is expected to manifest itself in the radical
recombination reactions, enzymatic and oxidative homogeneous catalysis,
cisetransisomerizationofmolecules,recombinationofspin-alignedhydrogen
atoms, etc. [34].
Now, we consider how spin catalysis in the triad occurs. Fig. 2.13 visu-
alizes this phase of spin catalysis by vector model. Suppose we have a triad
(R , R , R ) (Fig. 2.13A) with the pair of radicals (R , R ) in the triplet state
1 2 3 1 2
(both spins S and S are oriented up, spin S of spin catalyst R is directed

Assume now that the exchange interaction J between R and R is

permutationofspinsoccurs(Fig.2.13C)insuchawaythatthetriadisnowin
the spin state with the pair of reactive radicals R and R fixed in the singlet

state. The change of spin in the pair (R , R ) is compensated by the spin
1 2
change of the catalyst; ultimately, both total spin S and its projection S are
z
conserved, but the chemical reactivity of the triad is dramatically changed.
Spin catalysis is a purely physical phenomenon induced by nonmagnetic
(exchange) interactions. There is averyclear criterion to discriminateit from
othermagneticphenomena:exchange-inducedspincatalysisshoulddependon
the spin of the catalyst rather than on its magnetic moment. Turro et al. [35]
have measured the recombination probability of triplet radical pair (PhCH 2l

Solid-state chemistry in
magnetic fields
3.1 Solid-state reactions under magnetic control
Theoxidation ofsiliconcrystals, which is stronglyaccelerated byanexternal
magnetic field [1], demonstrates powerful magnetic catalysis. Oxygen mole-
cule in the triplet ground state as a primary oxidizing species is supposed to
insert into the SieSi bond as a key primary reaction of silicon oxidation
generating triplet radical pairs:
SieSiþO / [Si $ $ O Si]T
2 2
The external magnetic field stimulates tripletesinglet spin conversion of
the pair byZeemaninteraction(due tothe difference ofg-factors ofpartners)
and transforms the nonreactive triplet pair into the reactive singlet one,
stimulating its recombination into the reaction product, peroxide, and accel-
erating silicon oxidation. This effect, as well as the nuclear spin selectivity
produced by hyperfine coupling with magnetic 29Si atoms (see Chapter 2), is
in accordance with a mechanism for the solid-state silicon oxidation as an
electron and nuclear spin selective process, involving pairs of paramagnetic
intermediates.
The oxidation of silicon crystals by molecular oxygen demonstrates also
themagneticisotopeeffect:siliconatoms29Siareoxidizedtwicefasterthanthe
spinless, nonmagnetic nuclei 28Si and 30Si (Fig. 3.1); this effect supports the
radical pairmechanismforsolid-statesiliconoxidation.
The remarkable effect was discovered by Miller et al. [2e4]. Thermally
induced decomposition of many metal carbonates was found to produce
anomalous fractionation of magnetic isotope 17O in the reaction products:

Magnetically induced fractionation of oxygen isotopes is supposed to be
important in geochemistry and mineralogy as a means to decipher and un-
derstandreactionmechanismsbymonitoringtheisotopiccompositionofrocks
and deposits and reproducing their chemical genesis and evolution.
3.2 Magnetic field-induced crystal plasticity
The most important chemical reactions in solids are those, which control
crystal plasticity responsible for the mechanical and physical properties of
materials. The influence of the magnetic fields (both permanent and oscil-
lating)onthehardness,plasticity,andmicromechanicsofdiamagneticcrystals
(NaCl, PbS, LiF, Si, etc.) seems to be an unbelievable phenomenon, as the
energy of interaction between diamagnetic ions/atoms and the magnetic field
is negligible as compared to the energy of crystal deformation. Nevertheless,
this phenomenon exists and is known as magnetoplasticity [5,6]. The essence
underlying this enigmatic phenomenon is that the motion of dislocations in
diamagnetic crystals that are known to be responsible for the plasticity is
strongly influenced by magnetic field; the latter may accelerate or retard the
motion of dislocations. Detected experimentally this phenomenon for a long
time remained enigmatic. The physical mechanism of the phenomenon was

3.3 Microwave-induced plasticity
The decisive test for the validity of the suggested chemical mechanism for
magnetic plasticity would be direct experimental observation of a spin-
selective nanoreactor. Indeed, it was unambiguously shown that the hardness
andplasticityofdiamagnetic crystals are affected notonly bystatic magnetic
fields, but also by microwave fields [9e11]. The origin of the microwave
effects is easily seen in Fig. 3.2. It shows Zeeman levels of singlet (S) and
triplet (T) states of the two-spin nanoreactor in zero and in high magnetic
fields. In the former case, singlet and triplet states are degenerated, but in a

The resonant microwave field at Zeeman frequencies induces T

(cid:2)T(cid:2) transitions (Fig. 3.2) and additionally populates triplet state with
switched-offCoulombpotential,increasingtherateofdetachmentandfreerun
of dislocations, enhancing ultimately plasticity of ionic crystals [12].
Experimentalobservationsofmicrowaveeffectsonthedislocationrunsare
in perfect agreement with the predictions. Thus, in NaCl crystals doped by
Ca2þ
ions, a remarkable increase in the dislocation runs was detected at
resonant frequencies corresponding to nanoreactors with g ¼5.7(cid:4)0.7;
1
g ¼3.8(cid:4)0.3, and g ¼2.1(cid:4)0.2 (Fig. 3.3) [13]. Similar microwave effects
2 3
were exhibited in NaCl crystals doped by
Eu2þ
ions (Fig. 3.4). Here it was
found eight resonant frequencies which induce dislocation mobility and
decreasethehardnessofcrystals[14].Theseeightfrequenciesseemtoreferto
electron-nuclear levels of
Eu2þ
ions (nuclear spin of Eu is 5/2) in nonequiv-
alent sites of crystal lattice. What is the most important and unambiguous is
that the microwave pumping controls the chemistry of crystal plasticity.
In contrast to the ionic crystals in covalent crystals (diamond, silicon,
germanium) dislocations carry dangling bonds with free valences; their en-
counters with atomic defects orotherdislocationsoccur mostly intriplet spin
state. Permanent magnetic field induces T eS spin conversion (see Fig. 3.2);

subsequent annihilation of valences in the S state immobilizes dislocations.

tals;itresultsinprisoningdislocationsandincreasingthehardnessofcrystals.
Indeed, microwave effects on the silicon crystals were observed experi-
mentally: in the microwave field, the run of dislocations decreases by almost
40% [15] and exhibits resonance at gz2.0 indicating the valence (radical)
natureofnanoreactor(Fig.3.5).Anevenmoreconvincingresultwasobtained
in Ref. [16]: the starting stress required to stimulate dislocation motion
insiliconcrystalincreasedbyalmost40%inaresonantmicrowavefield.Both
effects demonstrate microwave-stimulated hardening of diamagnetic crystals.
Microwave effects on the crystals of ZnO, potassium hydrophthalate, and
glycine sulfate were also observed [17]. The hardness of ZnO was shown to
increase,whilethatofpotassiumhydrophthalateandglycinesulfatedecreases.
In all cases, the effect occurs in the resonance field at g-factor 2 and reaches
10(cid:2)15% under microwave pumping. Moreover, it exhibits strong magnetic
anisotropy demonstrating different orientations of the magnetic axes of
nanoreactorswithrespecttothecrystallographicaxes.Onemayconcludethat
magnetic catalysis is a general property of solid-state chemistry.
3.4 Magnetic memory of diamagnetic crystals
Magnetic control of the dislocation motion functions only if the crystal is
placed in a magnetic field. It is based on the spin-dependent fast processes in
thenanoreactordislocation/obstacle.However,thereexistsanothermechanism

ions (NaCl:Eu crystals).
Thehardness ofthese diamagnetic crystals wasrevealedtoberemarkably
affectedbythemagneticfield[18].Themostintriguingfeatureoftheeffectis
that the changes in the hardness were observed outside of the magnetic field
for a long time after crystals were exposed to the magnetic field; that is
magnetic field-induced changes in mechanical properties are conserved for a
long time in the absence of the magnetic field. The suggested mechanism of
this phenomenon is named as magnetic memory; it is based on the spin
dependenceoftheinterconversionbetweenthesingleparamagneticEu2þ

andtheirpairs.Thedirectunifyingofionsinpairsisspindependent(electron
spin of the
Eu2þ
ion is 7/2) while the dissociation of ion pairs is spin inde-
pendent. It results in the ratio of pairs to the single ions in a magnetic field
different from that in a zero magnetic field. Since the rates of dislocation
depinning from isolated single ions and their pairs are different, the plasticity
(andhardness)ofcrystalssubjectedtothemagneticfieldisdifferentfromthat
of crystals that were not exposed to the magnetic field. The difference in
plasticity of crystals with different magnetic prehistory is a quantitative
measureofmagneticmemory.Thelatterdecaysgraduallywhenthemagnetic

Magnetic scenarios in
environmental chemistry
4.1 Magnetic isotopes as a means to elucidate
environmental chemistry
Magnetic isotope effect (MIE) was predicted in 1971 [1] and experimentally
detectedin1976[2,3].ItwaschristenedastheMIEbecauseitiscontrolledby
magnetichyperfinecoupling;itresultsinthedependenceofthereactionrates
on the nuclear magnetic moments of reactants and fractionates isotopes by
their magnetic moments, rather than by their masses. Due to this property, it
providesanewpowerfultechnologyofisotopefractionationandanewtoolfor
environmental chemistry, as well as for geo-, biochemistry, and space chem-
istry. It allows tracing the chemical evolution of the matter, genesis, and
chemicalhistoryofthesubstancesinnature[4e6].TheobservationofMIEis
an unambiguous and the mostreliable indication ofthe radical mechanism of
thereactions;itimpliesthegenerationofradicalpairasatwo-spinsystemby
dissociation of molecules, by electron transfer, or by encounter of para-
magnetic species (Chapters 1 and 2). MIE is shown to function in a great
variety of processes in physics and chemistry [7,8] and in biology and med-
icine[9,10].ItisremarkablethatthemagnitudeofMIEisordinarybyanorder
of magnitude larger than that of the classical, mass-dependent isotope effect.
As wewill see later, in some biochemical reactions, MIE reaches even 200%
e300%.
There are two facets in isotopic environmental chemistry: first, isotope
effects produce isotope fractionation as a memory of the birth and trans-
formation of molecules; second, isotopes function as the labels certifying the
fate of chemical events [11,12]. This chapter centers on the first, the most
important function, thatis, the fractionation ofisotopesasitself.Itsgoal is to
identify and discuss chemical reactions responsible for the isotope fraction-
ation and to formulate mechanisms of the isotope-sorting reactions to foresee
and control these reactions and their hazards for the environment and living
organisms.
By definition,mass-independentisotope effects, including MIE, arethose,
which create anomalous isotopic distribution incompatiblewith that expected

photosynthetic generation and consumption. Only two isotopes, 16O and 18О,
were traditionally analyzed and monitored, implying that fractionation of the
third isotope 17О always obeys the relation d17Oz0.5 d18O. However, by
measurement of isotope contents in the chain oxidation of various organic
compounds by molecular oxygen [13,14], it was shown that the fractionation
of magnetic nucleus 17О strongly exceeds that predicted by relation
d17Oz0.5 d18O. The two spin selective and, therefore, isotope sorting re-
actions are responsible for this MIE-induced fractionation: recombination of
peroxyradicalsandadditionofoxygentoalkylradicals;theformerdominates
in oxidation of solids, and the latter prevails in liquid state oxidation.
In the oxidation of soft solids, such as polymers, the enrichment of mo-
lecular oxygen with magnetic nuclei 17O was proved to occur in the recom-
bination of peroxy radicals:

Here RO (cid:3) is the peroxy radical generated from organic compound RH.

Fractionation proceeds in the radical pair [ROO(cid:3) (cid:3)OOR] formed by the
encounter offreely diffusing peroxy radicals. The pair may either recombine,
forming unstable peroxide ROOOOR, which decomposes, releasing two
central oxygen atoms as O molecules, or dissociate regenerating peroxy
2
radicals. In the radical pairs, formed by encounters of radicals, the ratio of

Photo-oxidation of water by molecular oxygen as well as dark or photo-

Isotopes of iron: The chemical behavior of iron isotopes is the most
important for understanding the metabolic biomineralization of intracellular
magnetite Fe O nanoparticles, which occur in living organisms in special
3 4
organelles called magnetosomes. This process is known to be performed by
magnetotactic bacteria. Although they may be the earliest microorganisms
capable of biomineralization on Earth, identifying their activity in ancient
sedimentary rocks remains intriguing and needs isotopic biosignature.
Recently, Fe isotope fractionation by magnetotactic bacterium Magneto-
spirillummagneticumwasdiscoveredbyAmoretal.[24].Thesebacteriawere
shown to produce magnetite depleted in heavy Fe isotopes by 1.5e2.5&
relative to the initial growth medium. Moreover, mass-independent isotope
fractionation in magnetic 57Fe during magnetite biomineralization was
observed(D57Fe¼þ0.23&),butnotinnonmagneticisotopes54Fe,56Fe,and

thisFeisotopeanomalyprovidesapotentialbiomarkerfortheidentificationof
magnetite produced by ancient magnetotactic bacteria in geological records.
The MIE-induced anomalous enrichment of magnetite with 57Fe is pro-
posed to be generated during the reduction of Fe(III) into Fe(II) by cyto-
chromes or other redox enzymes. It implies that the spin transition in the
ioneradicalpair[Fe(II)L(cid:3) þ ],createdbyelectrontransferbetweenFe(III)and
reducing molecule L, is notably induced by hyperfine coupling with the

--- Page 55 ---

Magneticscenariosinenvironmentalchemistry Chapter | 4 43
magnetic moment of 57Fe nucleus. In the pair, [Fe(II) L(cid:3) þ ] back electron
transfer is spin-allowed, and it regenerates Fe(III) ion. The direct reaction,
generating product, is supposed to be spin forbidden but hyperfine coupling
with 57Fe partly allows this process. As a result, Fe(II) ions and magnetite
accumulate 57Fe nuclei.
However, Fe(II) is well known to be a high spin ion with a very short
electron relaxation time, much shorter than the time of spin conversion
induced by hyperfine coupling. Fast relaxation in this ion may prevent
þ
coherent spin conversion in pair [Fe(II) L(cid:3) ] and destroy MIE. The possible
way out of this contradictory situation is to assume that the coordination of
ions by ligands in the enzymatic site is such that it modifies the structure of
electron levels and delays spin relaxation in pair [Fe(II)
L(cid:3)þ
], although this
assumption remains to be speculative.
In a series of laboratory studies iron and oxygen isotope fractionation
during the intracellular production of magnetite by magnetotactic bacteria
magnetospirillum magnetotacticum and magnetovibrio blakmorei was inves-
tigated [25]. No detectable fractionation of iron isotopes in the bacterial
magnetite was observed. However, 18O isotope exhibited temperature-
dependent fractionation between Fe O and water, demonstrating a normal

perfine coupling in the Sn(CH ) radical (the coupling constants a(117Sn) and

a(119Sn) are equal to 1536G and 1607G) [27]. Fast spin conversion returns

these constants refer to 199Hg but can be easily converted to those for 201Hg.
MIE-induced fractionation of 199Hg was detected first time in the photol-
ysis of substituted dibenzyl-mercury [33]; it was shown to produce dibenzyl-
ethane and metallic mercury. Fig. 4.9 shows that the absolute abundance of
199Hg (measured by NMR as the intensities of satellite lines) in dibenzyl-
mercury, remaining after partial photolysis, increases in the course of reac-
tion: at the conversion of w50% the content of 199Hg increases by 4%.
The composition of the products and the isotope fractionation are satis-
factorily described by the scheme.

Isotope sorting occurs in the triplet radical pair formed upon CeHg bond
dissociationinthetripletexcitedmolecule.Thepairswith199Hgnucleirapidly
evolve from triplet to singlet state and recombine, returning magnetic nuclei
into the starting molecule. Tripletesinglet conversion of pairs with nonmag-
netic, even nucleus (200Hg, 202Hg) delays and these pairs dissociate into the
separated radicals; their subsequent reactions give products, dibenzyl-ethane
and metal mercury. Thus, the radical pair, being electron and nuclear spin
selective nanoreactor, acts as a molecular device that fractionates isotopes.
The starting dibenzyl-mercury is enriched in a 199Hg isotope under the
conditions when emulsion of colloid mercury has been precipitated and
photolysis has occurred in transparent solutions. However, on the continuous
photolysis of solutions with colloid mercury, dibenzyl-mercury was depleted
with 199Hg isotope. Such an inversion of the sign of isotope effect provides

4.2 Magnetic isotopes in living organisms
It is extremely important to elucidate isotope fractionation as a signature of
reaction mechanisms inside living organisms, particularly in the chemical
transformationofmethylmercurychloride(MMC);itisnowconsideredasone
of the most dangerous pollutant, which promotes the hardest neurological
disordersknownasaMinamatadisease[36].ThefirstobservationoftheMIE-
induced mercury isotope fractionation in enzymatic reaction of the ATP
synthesis by creatine kinase (CK) was announced in 2004 [37].
To elucidate the mechanism of the MMC toxic effect the authors have
studied CK enzymatic activity as a function of different isotopic forms of
MMC: CH199HgCl, CH200HgCl, CH201HgCl, H C202HgCl. The relative ac-
3 3 3 3
tivity of CK as a function of MMC concentration is plotted in Fig. 4.11. It
demonstrates the remarkable properties. First, a significant stimulation of CK
activity is observed at low concentrations of CH199HgCl and CH201HgCl,
3 3
whereas there is no such effect for CH200HgCl and CH202HgCl. Second, the
3 3
suppression of CK activity induced by high concentrations of MMC is very
sensitive to mercury isotopes (Fig. 4.11).
Thus,thelossofhalfoftheenzymaticactivityoccursattheconcentration
42mM for MMC with magnetic nuclei 199Hg and 201Hg, whereas, for MMC
withnonmagneticnuclei200Hgand202Hg,itoccursat2.8mM.ForMMCwith
anaturalabundanceofHgisotopes,thisconcentrationfallsbetweenthesetwo

natural abundance.
The effect of mercury isotopes on CK activity clearly indicates the dif-
ference in chemical reactivity of MMC molecules with magnetic and
nonmagneticnuclei.Itisabsolutelyunbelievablethatthedifferenceinnuclear
mass would play any role in this effect. First, the mass differences are too
small to cause any pronounced classical mass-dependent isotope effect; sec-
ond, experimentally measured effects are not selective to the mass of the Hg
nuclei but highly sensitive to the nuclear magnetism.
ThenuclearspinselectivityofthereactionbetweenCKandCH HgClwas
3
confirmed by a study of mercury isotope composition. Some part of MMC
molecules was shown to be chemically bound to CK. For the MMC with a
natural abundance of mercury isotopes, incubated with CK, the isotope

composition of CK with chemically bound MMC was measured. The results
presented in Fig. 4.12 convincingly demonstrate isotope fractionation in the
reaction of CK with MMC: the MMC molecules grafted to CK are strongly
enriched with magnetic isotopes and impoverished with nonmagnetic Hg
nuclei.

It is the first example of the magnetic isotope effect operating in a
biochemical system. The effect manifests itself both in the nuclear spin-
dependent enzyme activity and in isotope fractionation. The magnitude of
the latter is rather large, it is determined by a favorable combination of the
parameters characterizing molecular, spin, and chemical dynamics of the
radical pair.

Extensive studies of mercury isotope fractionation were carried out

inherited and transferred along the trophic chains and what environmental
factors, including industrial activity, control metabolism and evolution of

Fractionation of Hg stable isotopes during degradation of monomethyl
mercurytovolatileelementalHgandmethaneviathemicrobialHgresistance
pathway in Escherichia coli, carrying a mercury resistance genetic system,
deserves special attention [43]. In the microbial monomethyl mercury degra-
dation, isotope fractionation was shown to depend on the cell densities: at
lower densities enzyme catalysis functions, while at higher cell densities the
rate-limiting step is a transport into the cell, which does not cause isotope
fractionation.TheauthorssuggestthattheMIEisalsounlikelytooccurduring
other microbial Hg transformations. A recently published review of global
environmental mercury processes in response to human perturbations and
climate is also worthy of attention [44].
Fractionation of the isotopes by plants is highly important as a means to
elucidate plant physiology. It is shown to be induced by chemical reactions
facilitating metal uptake by roots. It occurs during the transport of the metals
within most plants, but its extent depends on plant species and on the metal.
The metal stable isotope variations observed in plants create an isotope
signature of life at the Earth’s surface, contributing substantially to our un-
derstanding of metal cycling processes in the environment and in individual
organisms [45]. Fractionation of the molybdenum isotopes, which has seven
stable isotopes 92Mo, 94Mo, 95Mo, 96Mo, 97Mo, 98Mo, and 100Mo, was also
studied[46].Molybdenumisotopefractionationwasshowntooccurduringthe

Fractionation of isotopes (particularly of those with magnetic nuclei) is a
powerful tool (and in many cases the only one) in tracking the pathways and
elucidating mechanisms of geochemical reactions. The great progress in un-
derstanding environmental chemistry may be firmly attributed to their func-
tioning.However,itisnecessarytodeliberatethatfurtherprogressmeetssome

when the magnitudes of D are not strongly exceeding the limit of errors. The

Enzymatic ATP synthesis under
magnetic control
5.1 Magnetic control of enzymatic ATP synthesis
GenerallyacceptedmechanismofATPsynthesisimpliesnucleophilicaddition
ofinorganicphosphate(byATPsynthase)orphosphategroupofthesubstrate
(by kinases) to ADP. In terms of this mechanism, the main function of the
Mg2þ
ion is traditionally thought to coordinate phosphate reactants, to keep
them in a position precisely on the reaction pathway of nucleophilic attack,
and perhaps to slightly modify their chemical reactivity by redistribution of
charges in a Mg(ADP) complex. The
Mg2þ
ion was always considered as an
assistant and never assumed to participate in the ATP synthesis as a reactant.
This mechanism was accepted as a paradigm, it does not imply the partici-
pation of any paramagnetic species in the ATP synthesis, so the discovery of
magnetic isotope and magnetic field effects [1,2] on the enzymatic ATP
synthesis catalyzed by magnesium, was unprecedented and seemed to be an
unbelievable result.
Creatine kinases (CK) loaded with isotopic ions
24Mg2þ
,
25Mg2þ
, and
26Mg2þ
unambiguously demonstrate different activity (Fig. 5.1): kinases, in
which magnesium has nonmagnetic isotopic nuclei 24Mg and 26Mg were
shown to be identical in their activity, while CK with
25Mg2þ
ion having
magnetic isotopic nucleus 25Mg is almost twice more efficient [2]. This is
convincing evidence that the magnetic isotope effect does occur in ATP
synthesis while the classical, mass-dependent isotope effect may be ignored.
Creatine kinases loaded with calcium isotopes (43Ca-CK and 40Ca-CK)
exhibit the same effect [3]: the efficiency of 43Ca-CK with magnetic nuclei
43Ca is almost twice higher than that of 40Ca-CK with nonmagnetic nuclei
40Ca(Fig.5.2).NotethatatlowconcentrationsofCaCl ,thereisnodifference
2
in the ATP yield, that is, there is no magnetic effect.
Similar effects are exhibited by 64Zn-CK and 67Zn-CK: 67Zn-CK with
magnetic nucleus 67Zn is by 3e5 times more actively synthesizes ATP than
64Zn-CKwith nonmagneticnucleus 64Zn[4].Pyruvatekinases PK,loadedby
zinc isotopes, also demonstrate the magnetic isotope effect: the efficiency of
67Zn-PK twice exceeds that of 64Zn-PK [4].

isotope effect on the ATP synthesis [4].
5.3 Radical pair mechanism as a means to control ATP

The reaction scheme was suggested [7,8] to account for this unusual
magnetic phenomenon; Schemes 5.1 and 5.2 illustrate RPM for particular
cases of ATP synthase (oxidative phosphorylation) and CK (substrate phos-
phorylation). The schemes are exemplified by magnesium and calcium ions
but they are valid also for zinc as well as for other enzymes. As a first step,
Scheme 5.1 implies electron transfer from the terminal phosphate group of
ADPtotheMg2þ

conservation, this pair is in a singlet spin state; the next step is the phos-
phorylation itself in which the ADP oxy-radical attacks the P]O chemical
bond of inorganic phosphate (reaction 2). The oxy-radical generated in this
reaction decomposes via b-scission of the PeO chemical bond (reaction 3)

5.4 Magnetic field effect on the ATP synthesis
According to the radical pair mechanism the catalytic site is a nuclear spin-
dependent nanoreactor with the two competing reaction channels, singlet
andtriplet.TheirrelativecontributionstotheATPsynthesisarecontrolledby
hyperfinecouplingofunpairedelectronswithmagneticnuclei25Mg,43Ca,and

25Mg2þ
ions, it increases by 50%
and70%inthefields55and80mT,respectively.IntheEarthfield,therateof
ATP synthesis by enzymes with

enzymes with nonmagnetic nuclei 24Mg or 26Mg. Both magnetic field and
magneticisotopeeffectsdemonstratethatATPsynthesisistheradicalprocess
affectedbyZeemaninteractionandhyperfinecouplingintheradicalpair.The
experimental results are in perfect agreement with theoretical predictions
[12,13].
5.5 Why magnetic effects in biology are ambiguous and
contradictory?
Magnetic effects are reliable, the most versatile tools, and unambiguous in-
dicators of the reaction mechanisms; their observations are irrefutable argu-
ments in favor of radical (mostly, electron transfer) reactions. However, the
inverted statement is invalid: if magnetic effects are not exhibited, it does not
mean that the radical mechanism is not operating [14]. There are factors that
preventthe detection ofthemagnetic effectsevenifthe radical mechanismis
certainly known to function, that is, the absence of observedmagnetic effects
is not diagnostic of the absence of radical pairs and RPM.
1. Thepresenceofparamagneticmetalions:Magneticeffectsasanindicator
of the radical mechanism may be switched off by the presence of para-
magnetic metal ions (such as Fe or Mn ions) as a component of the
enzymatic site or as the uncontrollable contaminating impurities. These
ions do not kill the radical pair mechanism but destroy coherent triplete
singlet spin conversion in the radical pairs and, therefore, prevent obser-
vation of the magnetic effects [15]. Table 5.1 and Fig. 5.6 confirm this
statement:thepresenceofFeCl eveninconcentration10
(cid:2)2mMisenough

to quench nuclear magnetic effects.
Such type of quenching effect was present in experiments carried out by
Crotty et al. [16]. They failed to reproduce magnetic effects on the ATP
production by creatine kinase. However, the samples of MgCl used by these
2
authors happened to be contaminated with Fe ions in amounts, which were
enough to destroy nuclear spin selectivity and delete both magnetic isotope
and magnetic field effects. Certainly, it was a reason, why neither isotope nor
magneticfieldeffectsontheATPsynthesiswerefound:thesamplesofMgCl

proof [11] and [17e19]).
The quenching effect was directly confirmed by measuring ATP yield
produced by two sorts of mitochondria, loaded with 25MgCl and 24MgCl
2 2
respectively [15]. Mitochondria were isolated from several rat tissues and the
ATP yields were correlated with independently determined iron contents in
these mitochondria. Isotope effect IE, that is the ratio of the ATP yields pro-
ducedbymitochondriawith25MgCl and24MgCl respectively,isdifferentfor
2 2
the different tissues (Fig. 5.7). The mitochondria with high contents of Fe
(spleen, liver) reveal no isotope effect (IEz1.0); however mitochondria
isolated from skeletal muscle, heart, kidneys and brain exhibit both low
content of Fe and large isotope effect (IE z1.8) in the ATP production. It
immediatelyfollowsthatthestimulationoftheATPsynthesisby25Mg2þ
ions
has a sense only in the tissues with low content of Fe in mitochondria. In
particular, an outstanding promotion of the in vivo ATP synthesis in heart
muscle occurs due to the low iron content in the heart mitochondria. The
presence of uncontrollable, even trace amounts of paramagnetic ions (iron,
cobalt,manganese,etc.)inthereactionmediummayresulttoirreproducibility
andcontradictionsofexperimentalobservationsinmagneto-biologicalstudies.

6.1 DNA synthesis: nucleophile mechanism
It is commonly accepted that the DNA synthesis, that is, attachment of the
nucleotide to the terminal ribose ring of the growing DNA chain, occurs as a
nucleophilicreaction,whichimpliesthatthereactionproceedsasanattackof
the phosphorus atom of the approaching nucleotide by ribose oxy-anion:
-O O- -O O-
O- + P O O P + -O
O O
This nucleophilic paradigm excludes the formation of any paramagnetic
intermediates and participation of radical mechanisms in the DNA synthesis.
However, to accomplish nucleophilic reaction, it is required to overcome
powerful repulsion between reactants. Nucleophilic transfer of phosphate
group is energy strongly deficient and needs to overcome the energy barrier
42e46kcal/mol [1,2]. The high barrier is a reason why DNA synthesis does
not occur in homogeneous solutions, and it is accomplished only by DNA
polymerases, special molecular machines. A source of the energy needed to
cover the energy deficit for energy-expensivenucleophilic reaction is thought
to be a compression of the catalytic site, induced by protein mechanical en-
ergy, which compresses reactants overcoming their repulsion.
Enzymatic DNA synthesis is known to be catalyzed by
Zn2þ
,
Ca2þ
, and
Mg2þ
ions, which are traditionally considered to coordinate reactants in the
catalyticsitekeeping them onthereaction trajectorytofacilitatenucleophilic
attack. The prediction [3] and discovery [4] of the magnetic isotope effect in
chemistry [5e8] stimulated invasion of magnetic isotopes in geological and
environmentalchemistry(Chapter4),inbiochemistryandmedicine(Chapter9).
In enzymatic reactions, the effects were first detected in the ATP synthesis by
isolated enzymes and then by whole living organisms (Chapter 5). Nuclear
magnetic ions 25Mg2þ were shown to strongly, by 3e5 times, increase the

Magnetic control in chemical genetics occurs by radical pair mechanism
(RPM), which is well known in chemistry [9e12] and implies pairwise gen-
eration of radicals by electron transfer between reaction partners. It is worth
rememberingthatthereactionsinthepairarecontrolledbyapowerfulfactor,

Evidently,thismechanismmaybealsocontrolledbymagneticfieldsofisotopic
nuclei; the latter is known as the magnetic isotope effect, which is the depen-
denceofthereactionratesonthenuclearmagneticmomentsofreactants.
In the majority of publications, exhibiting magnetic effects on the gene
chemistry [13e24], it is recognized that the sources of the effects remain
enigmatic. In principle, one can imply magnetic control of genes in three
processes: the DNA synthesis, which elongates DNA chains creating genes;
the cleavage, the scission of DNA chains producing DNA damage and
destroying genes; the DNA repair. All three processes are shown to be
magnetically vulnerable and result to the total magnetic control of genes; the
latter is shown to be a powerful means to kill cancer cells. This chapter
summarizes recent observations of magneto-genetic effects; its goal is to
suggest and analyze molecular mechanisms underlying magnetic control of
genes, to enlighten biochemical and medical consequences of the control and
offer means how to deliberately use them in medicine.
6.2 Magnetic control of the DNA synthesis
DNA synthesis is generally accepted to occur as a nucleophilic reaction
catalyzed by
Mg2þ

ions; no paramagnetic intermediates are

However, the substitution of these catalyzing ions in polymerases by the ions

The appearance of a large magnetic isotope effect is an unambiguous in-
dicator of the RPM, which is switched on at the concentration, when the
second ion enters into the enzymatic site (the reason will be discussed later).
The famous polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was shown to be also
inhibited by
25Mg2þ
ions [26] convincingly confirming the nuclear magnetic
isotope effect: the efficiency of the DNA synthesis by PCR enzyme is almost
identical to that by polymerase b (Fig. 6.2).

6.3 Enzymatic radical pair mechanism
The observation of magnetic effects is unambiguous evidence that DNA
synthesis occurs by magnetically sensitive radical pair mechanism, which
implieselectrontransferfromthereagenttothemetalioninthecatalyticsite;
the mechanisms of these reactions were suggested and substantiated [25,26].
6.3.1 Why electron transfer occurs
It is necessary to deliberate that the key enzymes, synthesizing the main life-
producing and life-supporting molecules, function as compressing devices.

Now, we will consider how enzymatic radical pair mechanism (ERPM)
arises and functions. Electron transfer as a generator of the radical pairs is
induced by the remarkable property of enzymes to squeeze water molecules

regimes.Theenergyofthisreactionwascomputed(Fig.6.4)tobenegativefor
the large n, that is, electron transfer is endothermic and forbidden in water
[29]. Again, like in the case of the ATP synthesis (Chapter 5), the removal of
watermoleculesbycompressionofthecatalyticsiteintheDNApolymerases
dehydrates catalyzing ions, switching on energy cheap ERPM. At n>n*
electron transfer is endoergic and energy forbidden, at n<n* it is exoergic
and energy allowed. When n reaches n* electron transfer becomes inevitable
and switches on the ERPM. According to the ERPM the compression energy

and activates this ion as an electron acceptor.
In the case of DNA synthesis, the electron is donated by the ribose oxy-
anion of the growing DNA chain to the M(H

ion (Scheme 6.1); it is
the first step of the ERPM.

Channel 1 produces DNA but it is endoergic and not efficient; channels 2
and 3 are exoergic and dominate, but do not produce DNA [26]. Ultimately,
the ERPM appears to be strongly destructive and almost prevents DNA
synthesis.

aresult,ionswithmagneticnucleistimulatesingletetripletspinconversionof
the primary pair and direct DNA synthesis along the radical, destructive
pathway, inhibiting ultimately DNA synthesis.
For the sake of clarity, it is worthy to elucidate the difference in the
functioning24Mg2þ and25Mg2þ
ions.Whenthecompressionoftheenzymatic
site becomes relaxed, the water molecules return to the ions restoring their
initial states. Now, 24Mg þ ion returns an electron to the ribose oxy-radical,
transforming it into the oxy-anion and restoring the initial state of the enzy-
maticsite.However25Mg þ ion,beingincludedinthetripletpair,isnotableto
return electrons to the ribose oxy-radical; the latter reacts by addition to the
approaching nucleotide, generating the OXY radical shown above. This is a
key reason, why nuclear magnetic ions inhibit DNA synthesis in comparison
with nonmagnetic isotopic ions.
Thebehaviorofmagnesiumionsisdifferentfromthatofcalciumandzinc
ions. It is clearly seen in Fig. 6.1: at low concentrations, there is no isotope
effect. At the higher concentration, when the second ion enters into the
enzymatic site, the ERPM is switched on, resulting to suppression of DNA
synthesis;theappearanceofisotopeeffectisanunambiguousindicatorofthe
RPM. Note, that again the ERPM is induced by both sorts of ions, magnetic
andnonmagnetic,theybothdecreasetheefficiencyofDNAsynthesis;theonly
difference is that magnetic ions function more strongly and inhibit DNA
synthesis by 3e5 times more efficiently than the nonmagnetic ones. Poly-
merases with
24Mg2þ
and
26Mg2þ
ions exhibit no difference in enzymatic
activity; it means that the mass-dependent isotope effect is negligible.
6.3.2 Magnetic field effect on the DNA synthesis
Additional and irrefutable evidence in favor of the radical pair mechanism is
the dependence of the DNA synthesis on the magnetic field (Fig. 6.6). The
external magnetic field inhibits DNA synthesis assisted by
24Mg2þ
ions, pre-
ventingpartlyelongationoftheDNAchainandgenesynthesis,butstimulates
it in the sites loaded with
25Mg2þ
ions [26].
TheinversionofthemagneticfieldeffectissimilartothatfoundintheATP
synthesis (Chapter 5); it is induced by competition of Zeeman and Fermi in-
teractions, which produce singletetriplet spin conversion of the radical pairs.
In the polymerase with 24Mg2þ ions singletetriplet conversion is induced by
Zeemaninteraction with the rate DgbH(Dg is adifference ofg-factorsofthe
radical pair partners, H is the magnetic field); it stimulates triplet, destructive
reaction channel, and suppresses DNA synthesis. In the polymerase with
25Mg2þ ions, singletetriplet conversion is induced by Fermi, hyperfine
electron-nuclearinteraction,whicheffectivelyfunctionsinzeromagneticfield
stimulating triplet, destructive reaction channel and suppressing DNA syn-
thesis. However, magnetic field H compensates Fermi interaction, preventing
singletetriplet conversion and destructive channel. As a result, the yield of

DNA in magnetic fields is increased with respect to that in absence of mag-
neticfield.ThecompetitionofZeemanandFermiinteractionsisquantitatively
and irrefutably explained by theory [9].
Now we will discuss why magnetic field effects, induced by
24Mg2þ
and
25Mg2þ
ions, are different. The effect arises from the spin conversion in the

Onthecontrary,themagneticfieldincreasestherateofDNAsynthesisby

the spin dynamics. In the pair [30O(cid:2) 25Mg þ ]S in zero magnetic field all three

0
channels, SeTþ and SeT(cid:3), are switched off (Fig. 6.8); the latter effect
dominates and results in the suppression of the radical pair mechanism and
ultimately increasing DNA yield (Fig. 6.6). This prediction is in a perfect
agreement with experiment.
6.3.3 Does biological longevity depend on the magnetic fields?
The ERPM characterizes reaction, not enzyme; it means that the different
enzymes carrying out the same reaction (for instance, the addition of a
nucleotide tothegrowing DNAchain) will exhibitidentical magnetic isotope

effects. In otherwords, various DNA-, RNA-polymerases, and telomerase are
expected to be identical in response to the isotopic forms of catalyzing ions.
Forthis reason, Hayflick limitandlongevity are certainlyexpectedto depend
on the isotope substitution of metal ions. However, these isotope effects are
hardly interesting for modern medicine. The most interesting seems to be the
magneticfieldeffectontheHayflicklimitandbiologicallongevity.Asshown
in Section 6.3.2, a magnetic field decreases theyield of DNA by 1.5 times, if
polymerase b is loaded with 24Mg2þ ions; on the contrary, for enzymes with
25Mg2þ
ions, a magnetic field increases the yield of DNA by 2.5 times
independently of the ion concentration. In living organisms, magnesium iso-
topes are presented in natural abundance, that is, 10% of nuclear magnetic
isotope 25Mg and 90% of nonmagnetic isotopes 24Mg and 26Mg. Evidently,

24Mg and 26Mg. Keeping in mind that both sorts of sites are functioning
independentlyandadditively,theirmagneticfieldeffectscompensateforeach
other. Due to the compensation of the sites, loaded with 25Mg and 24,26Mg
ions,themagneticfieldeffectontheHayflicklimitandbiologicallongevityis
expected to be not significant, at least for enzymatic reactions catalyzed by
magnesium ions [30]. It is worth noting that the well-being of some people
dependsonthemagneticstorms,butthecauseofthisdependenceseemstobe
side effects (in particular, variations in concentration of negative ions in the
atmosphere or changes in atmospheric pressure), but not magneto-genetic
effects.
6.4 Does DNA polymerase need the third ion to
synthesize DNA?
Theinvasion ofthe first and second metal ions inthe enzymatic site switches
on the radical pair mechanism. What are the third and following ions? By
using an elegant time-resolved technique of X-ray crystallography, it was
shown [28] that the capture of the third
Mg2þ
ion is required for the DNA
synthesis to occur. This conclusion is valid for the reaction in crystallo-
catalysis, that is, at the condition when the escape of the pyrophosphate ion
(Channel 1) is restricted in a confined space of assembled complex; then the
third ion stimulates Channel 1 accelerating departure of pyrophosphate ion.
This conclusion is also valid for native DNA synthesis as shown in Figs. 6.9
and 6.10. After switching on the ERPM and decreasing the rate of DNA
synthesis, it is observed a significant increase in the rate assisted by the third
ion, both magnetic and nonmagnetic. Evidently, like in the case of crystallo-
catalysis, the third ion activates Channel 1 stimulating and accelerating the
departure of pyrophosphate ion; this effect is exhibited by Mg (Figs. 6.9 and
6.10)andbyCaandZnions(Figs.6.11and6.12),bothmagnetic(25Mg,43Ca,
67Zn)andnonmagnetic(24Mg,26Mg,40Ca,and64Zn).Note,thatthethirdion
does not change isotope effect; it seems to be an indication that the third ion
seats on the pyrophosphate group facilitating its departure and stimulating
DNAsynthesisalongtheChannel1.Thereasonisthattheadditionofthethird
ion occurs by noncovalent bonds, it is not spin selective; this ion does not
participate in the reaction itself and does not produce additional magnetic
isotope effect.
Theseconsiderationsareinperfectagreementwiththepostchemistrysteps
ofnucleotideincorporationbyDNApolymeraseanalyzedbyReedetal.[31].
Thus, the efficiency of DNA-polymerases depends on the number of ions in
the catalytic site: the first and second ions induce magnetically sensitive
radical pair mechanism, the third and the following ions are accepted by
pyrophosphate residue facilitating its departure and stimulating DNA
synthesis.

6.5 Magnetic control of the DNA damage
Many observations evidence that the DNA and genes are subjected to
magnetically induced damage; the examples are presented below.
6.5.1 Electromagnetic control of genes
Theeffect ofradiofrequencyradiation emittedbymobilephonesontheDNA
damage in follicle cells of hair in the ear canal was investigated by comet
assay [32], which is known to be a rapid, simple, and highly sensitive fluo-
rescence microscopic gel electrophoresis technique used to detect DNA
damage. The measured comet assay parameters (head length, tail length,
cometlength,percentageofheadDNA,andtailDNApercentageastheDNA
damage indicators) were markedly higher in the cells of men (42 persons)
subjected to radiofrequency radiation than in the control, not subjected to
radiation, group of men (14 persons). It was concluded that radiofrequency
radiation produces DNA damage in the follicle cells of hair.
The action of radiofrequency irradiation emitted from a GSM 900-MHz
mobile phone on the proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of adult
murine neural stem cells was studied [33]. The number and size of resulting
neuro-spheres and the percentage of cells differentiated into neurons were
shown to significantly decrease with increasing exposure duration to the
electromagnetic field. In contrast, exposure to electromagnetic fields at
differentdurationsdidnoteffecttheviability,apoptosis,anddifferentiationof
astrocytes.Theseresultsunambiguouslyexhibitmagneticallyinduceddamage
of genes. However, the interrupting regime of electromagnetic irradiation
seems to create conditions for the repair of damaged DNA and genes; this
observationisimportanttokeepinmindforusersofmobilephones.Magnetic
control of DNA damage and repair on the molecular level is a key to realize
the effects of mobile phones, high voltage lines, and any electromagnetic
sources on human health.
On the contrary, the long-term (2 years) exposure of murine brains to
mobile telephone radiofrequency fields [34] did not produce any astrocyte
reaction; however, the exposure has been carried out in the interrupting
regime, so that this observation is in agreement with the previous one. The

adverse reactions in the central nervous system, including sleep disorders in
addition to learning and memory impairments [37]. The elevated risks of

were emphasized by statistical analysis [39].
However,transcranialmagneticstimulationwasshownbynumerousworks

magnetically induced positive effects are supposed to be responsible for the
long-termed favorable medical functions of transcranial magnetic stimulation
as a powerful means to correct or even to prevent cognitive deceases [21].
At first sight, these observations are contradictive: sometimes the effects
arepositive,andsometimestheyarenegative.However,itisnecessarytokeep
in mind that the magnetic effects are switched on or off as a function of the

different cells not homogeneously; moreover, their concentration depends on
thephysiologicalstateofcellsandorganisms,onthediet,etc.Itmeansthatthe
electromagneticeffectsonthelivingorganismarehardlycertainlypredictable
but they may be deliberately controlled for medical purposes, particularly in
the case when the ions may be delivered on target.
6.5.2 Magnetically induced DNA damage
A strong evidence of magnetically controlled DNA damage follows from the
effect exhibited by HL-60 cancer cells: the loading of these cells by
43Ca2þ
ions produces short DNA fragments that count 25e35 nucleotides in length
contrasting with the normal 180e210 nucleotides produced by 40Ca2þ poly-
merase[40].Theions25Mg2þ and67Zn2þ
demonstratethesimilareffects:they
alsoproduceabnormallyshort(25e35nucleotides)fragments[41e43],which
are not formed in cells loaded with ions
24Mg2þ
and
64Zn2þ
. The abnormally
short, an “invalid” DNA segments, are known to be inefficient in the DNA
repair. These findings clearly indicate that the reactions responsible for the
DNAdamagearemagneticallycontrolled.Evidently,externalmagneticfields,
acting on the macroscopic level, and internal magnetic fields of magnetic
nucleiofcatalyzingions,actingontheatomiclevel,produceidenticaleffects:
they both induce DNA damage. Gene expression of plants was also shown to
be regulated by static magnetic field [44].
The combined effect of the magnetic magnesium isotope 25Mg and levo-
floxacin on the significant suppression of E. coli bacteria growth has been
found [45]. The growth rate constant and the average density of bacterial
culture,grownonamediumwithamagneticisotope25Mg,decreasedby3e4
times compared to bacteria, grown on media with nonmagnetic isotopes
24,26Mg and natural magnesium. The morphology changes of such bacterial

supposed that these results are of great therapeutic significance; they indicate
the magnetic sensitivity of DNA-synthesizing systems invivo.
6.6 Magnetic control of the DNA repair
Among the various DNA damages induced by radiation the DNA double-
strand breaks are known to be the most dangerous for the survivability of
cells; comet assay was used to detect these breaks and their repairing [46];
Fig. 6.13 shows that the rate of repairing in the presence of
25Mg2þ
ions is
slower than in the presence of
24Mg2þ
ions.
Thekineticsofdecayofdouble-strand DNAbreaks,inducedbyradiation,
is different for
25Mg2þ
, and
24Mg2þ
ions. The decay occurs as a first-order
reaction; the rate constants for this process are 1.1(cid:4)10 (cid:3)3 s (cid:3)1 and
1.6(cid:4)10 (cid:3)3s (cid:3)1for25Mg2þ and24Mg2þ ions,respectively.Evidently,theDNA
repairing exhibits remarkable isotope effect: in the presence of
25Mg2þ
ions
the rate of repair is by 1.5 times lower than in the presence of
24Mg2þ
ions,
demonstratingthattherepairingisamagneticallysensitiveprocess.Thisresult
is in accordance with the effect of inhibiting DNA synthesis by nuclear
magneticisotopicionsofMg,Ca,andZnandindicatesthattheDNAsynthesis
seems to be the important part of the total repairing process.

Magnetically controlled cancer
7.1 Cancer under magnetic field control
According to the WHO reports, cancer remains to be one of the two leading
causesofdeathworldwide;therepresentativedataofcancer-inducedmortality
inthelargeMachengCity(China)werecollectedandsummarizedbyLietal.
[1]. Fig. 7.1 demonstrates parameter a, the fraction of the total mortality,
induced by cancer for the different age groups. It certifies some clearly
expressed tendencies.
1. The cancer-induced mortality increases as the age increases and then
reaches a maximum and decreases. The peak of mortality depends on the
periodwhenthemortalitydatawerecollected:fortheperiodof1984e88,
itisattheagegroupof45e49;fortheperiodof2009e13,itisatthegroup
40e44. It clearly indicates that the cancer mortality over the period of 25
years(thelifetimeofonegeneration)isshiftedtothemoreyoungageby5
years, that is, cancer kills more young generations.
2. This unfavorable trend becomes even more convincible by comparing
curves 1 and 2: cancer-induced mortality over the period of 2009e13 is
almost doubled with respect to the period of 1984e88.
3. The mortality of the young age group 20e24 is almost twice as large as
that of the age group 80e84. It does not mean that cancer-induced mor-
tality decreases for elderly people; it is just the evidence that other de-
ceases become more important and dominating.
There are several hundred publications concerning antitumor magnetic
effects; only the recent publications will be considered as examples. Low-
frequency magnetic field (0e0.15 T, 4.2Hz) has been shown to inhibit over
30% melanoma, liver, and lung cancer growth in mice bearing MDA-MB231
and MCF7 human breast cancer cells [2]. The authors claim that this effect
has clinical potential to inhibit breast cancer growth. A different effect of
electromagnetic irradiation on the viability of cancer and healthy cells was
found [3].
In another study, the antitumor effect of the magnetic field against neu-
roblastoma andnephroblastoma is reported[4].After2h per dayofexposure
to the magnetic field of the cells, their viability decreased significantly after

2 days. After 3 days, inhibition rates of 17%e22% in these cells were ach-
ieved. Exposure to the field was shown to decrease cell proliferation and
induce apoptosis. Electromagnetic fields of low frequencies 7.83 and 60Hz
wereshowntoinhibitcancercells[5];exposedtosweepfrequenciesfor24h,
these cells were inhibited by 17%e26% compared with those of the control
group.
The authors [6] suggested that electromagnetic fields raise intracellular
levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can be toxic to cancer cells.
They tested this idea by studying the effects of an oscillating magnetic field,
produced by a permanent magnet, spinning with a specific frequency, on the
consumption of oxygen by isolated rat liver mitochondria, by normal human
astrocytes, several patient-derived brain tumor cells, and O generation/con-
2
sumption by plant cells with an O electrode. Glucose metabolism in tumor
2
cellsusing1Hand13Cnuclearmagneticresonancewasalsoinvestigated.The
rotating magnetic field of appropriate strength and frequency was shown to
completely arrest electron transport in rat liver mitochondria and patient-
derived glioblastoma; this technique is supposed to be therapeutically effi-
cient in brain cancers.
The moderate intensity (0e0.15 T) low-frequency (4.2Hz) rotating mag-
netic field was shown to inhibit melanoma, liver, and lung cancer growth in
mice [2], and it is supposed that it might be a safe physical method that has
clinical potential to be used to inhibit breast cancer growth. The authors [7]
comparedtheeffectsofextremelylow-frequencyelectromagneticfield(EMF)
incooperationwiththechemotherapeuticagent doxorubicin(DOX)ontumor
growthandthehepaticredoxstateinWalker-256carcinosarcoma-bearingrats.
Animals were divided into five groups with one control (no tumor) and four
tumor-bearing groups: no treatment, DOX, DOX combined with EMF, and
EMF. While DOX and DOXþEMF provided greater inhibition of tumor

--- Page 101 ---

Magneticallycontrolledcancer Chapter | 7 89
growth, treatment with EMF alone resulted in some level of antitumor effect.
Superoxide dismutase, catalase activity, and glutathione content were signif-
icantly decreased in the liver of tumor-bearing animals as compared with the
control group. However, hepatic levels of thiobarbituric acid, reactive sub-
stances,andanindicatoroflipidperoxidationwerethreetimeslowerinEMF
andDOXþEMFgroupsthaninnotreatmentandDOX.Theseresultsindicate
that EMF treatment can inhibit tumor growth, causing less pronounced
oxidative stress damage to the liver. Therefore, EMF can be used as a thera-
peutic strategy to influence the hepatic redox state and combat cancer with
reduced side effects.
In the recent review [8], the authors concluded that magnetic fields at the
molecular level suppress tumors by interfering with DNA synthesis, ROS
level, second messenger molecule delivery, and orientation of epidermal
growth factor receptors. Anticarcinogenic effect of extremely low-frequency
EMFs was discussed in terms of quantum biology [9].
7.2 Nuclear magnetic effects on the cancer cells
NuclearmagneticcontroloftheDNAsynthesisandgenerepairmayappearto
be important for the vitality of cancer cells. Indeed, as shown in Chapter 6,
nuclearmagneticions25Mg2þ ,43Ca2þ ,and67Zn2þ
controlDNAsynthesisand
strongly, by 2e3 times, suppress the catalytic activity of polymerases. These
ionsweretestedasameanstokillcancercellsHL-60;theyweredeliveredinto
the cells by nanocontainer PMC16 (Fig. 7.2); the remarkable properties and
functioning of this molecule are discussed in Chapter 9.
The results are presented in Fig. 7.3; they unambiguously demonstrate
differentsurvivalofbothsortsofcells:cancercellsaremuchmorevulnerable
with respect to nuclear magnetic ions than healthy cells [10]. It means that
magnetic control of the DNA synthesis by nuclear magnetic ions of magne-
sium,calcium,andzincisapowerfulanduniversalmeanstokillcancercells.
These ions strongly, by 20e40 times, increase mortality of cancer cells and
maybeconsideredasapowerfulanduniversalmeansforkillingcancercells.
The remarkable anticancer effects were discovered by Bukhvostov et al.
[11,12]. The inhibition of DNA synthesis by polymerase b from the retino-
blastoma cancer cells Y70 and WERI-RB loaded with
25Mg2þ
,
43Ca2þ
, and

ions is accompanied by another effect, a sharp increase in the cell

Decreasing catalytic activity of polymerase by 3e5 times, nuclear mag-
netic ions 25Mg2þ , 43Ca2þ , and 67Zn2þ even more strongly, by 30e50 times,
increasemortalityofcancercells.Nodoubtthatthesamemechanismoperates

Theseresultsunambiguouslydemonstratedifferentsurvivalofbothsortsof

nuclear magnetic ions than healthy cells; evidently, this medical aspect of
magnetic effects is extremely promising.
The extremevulnerability ofcancer cells to the ions with magnetic nuclei
cannot be attributed to the possible difference in the penetrability of mem-
branesincancerandhealthycells,astheisotopeeffectonthediffusionofions
through membranes should be certainly ignored. The enormously large dif-
ferencebetweentheefficiencyofmagneticionstosuppressDNAsynthesis(by
2e5 times) andtodestroycancer cells (by10e50 times) seems, at firstsight,
to be intriguing; there are at least two reasons for this intrigue.

92 MagneticEffects
The first is the remarkable properties of PMC16 molecules and of cancer
cells. Metal ions were deliveredinto the cells by nanocontainer PMC16. This
molecule hardly penetrates the cell membrane, it is highly likely attached to
the cell surface by a hydrophilic porphyrin tail, which carries metal ions,
chelated by carboxylic groups as shown in Fig. 7.2 for the particular case of
magnesium ions. As mentioned earlier, PMC16 is a smart molecule; it liber-
atesmetalionspredominantlyintheacidicmedia.ThepHattheextracellular
surfacesofdifferentcancercellswasmeasuredbyusingfluorescenceimaging
[16]. It was shown that the pH at the surfaces of cancer cells can be 0.7e0.9
pHunitslowerthanthepH,typically7.4,ofthebulkfluidsinnormaltissues,
thatis,aroundcancercellsthereexistssomethinglikean“acidiccrown.”The
PMC16 molecule loaded with magnetic ions, being adsorbed on the highly
acidicsurfaceofthecancercell,liberatestheions;thelatterenterintothecell
andsuppressDNAandRNAsynthesis.Finally,thecancercellisimpoverished
with DNA, RNA, enzymes, and proteins; ultimately, it results in the death of
the cell.
On the surface of healthy cells with neutral pH, PMC16 does not release
metal ions or release them in negligible amounts, so their concentration in
healthycellsismuchlowerthanincancercells.Attheseconcentrations,the
radical pair mechanism does not switch on and the suppression of the DNA
and RNA synthesis does not occur. These two factors, the property of
PMC16todonateionsinacidicmediaandthehighacidityofthecancercell
surfaceresultinthesurvivalofhealthycellsandthehighmortalityofcancer
cells. Evidently, the PMC16 loaded with nuclear magnetic ions may be
considered as a powerful and universal means to kill only cancer cells
[17,18].
There is also another reason for the high mortality of cancer cells. As
pointed out in Chapter 6, the loading of cancer cells by
43Ca2þ
,
25Mg2þ,
and
67Zn2þ ions produces short DNA fragments that count 25e35 nucleotides, in
contrast with the normal 180e210 nucleotides produced by 40Ca2þ , 24Mg2þ
and
64Zn2þ
ions. These abnormally short, “invalid” DNA segments, were
foundtoefficientlyinhibitthecatalyticactivityofDNApolymerase[19e22].
Thiseffectallowsconsideringthesesubstancesaspotentialantitumordrugs;it
is confirmed experimentally both in vitro (using cancer cell cultures) and
invivo (using cancer models in mice).
It is worth noting that the COVID-19 is recently proposed to be a mani-
festation of magnetic catalysis of pathogenic coronavirus from endogenous
viruseswithinthehumangenomeviachiralsymmetrybreakingandmagnetic
catalysis, which is mediated by magnetic anomalies [23,24]. At first glance,
this idea seems to be speculativebutthere are some arguments, which do not
allow ignoring it; of course, this hypothesis needs to be deliberated and
analyzed.

Magnetically controlled brain
A new technology of brain and cortex neuron stimulation by oscillating
magnetic fields is being rapidly introduced into medicine, in particular, into
neurophysiology;themagneticfieldsaresuppliedtopatients’headsbymeans
of magnetic coils fed by alternating current. The alternating magnetic field,
generated by the coils, penetrates through the cranial bones (this gave rise to
the name “transcranial”) and acts on the neurons through electric potential
modulation [1e3]. A new, “advanced version of this technology employs
transcranial stimulation together with brain imaging, which opens uptheway
for direct targeted stimulation of the specified brain areas (navigational
transcranial magnetic stimulation) [4].
Thistechnologybringsabouttwosignificantquestions:(1)whetherornot
biological subjects (in particular, neurons) are able to perceive the magnetic
field, and (2) whether or not the magnetic reception is significant for the
functioningofthesesubjects.Directmedicalexperienceanswers“yes”toboth
questions: it is possible to treat cognitive disorders and neurological diseases
(stroke consequences, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, pain syndromes, paraly-
sis, and schizophrenia). Moreover, there is reliable evidence that transcranial
magneticstimulation(TMS)performsmoleculartransformationsinthecortex,
which are remembered and retained for long (weeks and months) after the
TMS operation has been switched off. This long-term effect is a great
advantage of TMS as a medical technology. This, however, brings about the
question: what are the molecular mechanisms of the effect (considered
below)?
MostofTMSworkspursuepurelymedical,therapeuticgoals.Thestudies
performed at the molecular, biochemical levels can be classified into two
groups.Onegroupdealswiththeanalysisoftheeffectofgenepolymorphism
onthesensitivitytoTMS;inotherwords,theytrytofindoutwhatgenesactas
TMS receivers and what genes are TMS-insensitive. The second group of
works deals directly with the TMS-induced changes in the genome.

receptor polymorphism on TMS signals (99 patients) [5]. It was found that
C/C patients were much more susceptible to TMS than the C/G and G/G
subjects. One more vivid example of genetic polymorphism susceptibility to
TMS is the difference between the Val66Met and Val66Val alleles of the ge-
netic neurotropic factor-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), one of

many genes that affect synapse plasticity [6]. The effect of mutations in the
GABA g-amino glutamic acid receptor on the cortex susceptibility to TMS
A
signals was investigated [7]. Studies of this type combining therapy and ge-
netics indicate reliably and unambiguously that the genome is the key factor
governing the TMS effects; it also determines the genome susceptibility to
TMS and the magnitude of TMS-induced effects.
Works of the other group address the changes in the enzyme activity and
gene expression stimulated by TMS. In the TMS recurrent pulse mode
(1e10Hz), enhanced expression of genes translating the c-Fos and zif268
proteinsintheratcortexwasdemonstrated[8].Atlow-frequency(0.1Hz)but
high-amplitude (5000e100,000G) TMS, significant effects in the prolifera-
tion and differentiation of the neural stem cells in the cortex of neonatal rats
were detected [9], the most pronounced effect being attained in the 40,000G
field.
High levels of the NO neurotransmitter and сGMP (cyclic guanosine
monophosphate) in the cerebral cortex, grooves, and hippocampus were
detectedinratsthathavebeenexposedtoelectromagneticradiationfor5days
(frequency 60Hz, amplitude 20G); moreover, neither the number of neurons
nor the morphology changed. The only possible conclusion was drawn: the
originoftheeffectsshouldbeinincreasedexpressionofgenesresponsiblefor
the synthesis of the neuronal NO-synthase in the cerebral cortex of rats sub-
jected to TMS [10]. Numerous works of this type prove unambiguously that
theTMSmagneticsignalstriggerthegeneexpressionandproductionofsome
enzyme proteinsdand this accounts for the long-term therapeutic effect of
TMS.
It was revealed [11] that repetitive TMS (rTMS) induces a significant in-
crease of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content and MAP-2 expression in the
left brain following ischemic insult and different rTMS parameters had
different effects on the ATP level and the MAP-2 expression in the left
striatum.ItisconcludedthatrTMSmaybecomeapotentialadjunctivetherapy
for ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stim-
ulation (rTMS) was shown to induce neuronal long-term potentiation or
depression[12].AlthoughtheycontributetotheeffectsofrTMS,theirprecise
role and underlying mechanism remain poorly understood. It is shown that
daily5HzrTMSfor5daysimprovesbrain-derivedneurotrophicfactorBDNF
and its cognate tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) signaling in rats by
increasing the affinity of BDNF for TrkB, which results in higher tyrosine-
phosphorylated TrkB, increased recruitment of PLC-g1 and shc/N-shc to
TrkB, and heightened downstream ERK2 and PI-3K activities in prefrontal
cortex and in lymphocytes. The elevated BDNF-TrkB signaling is accompa-
niedbyanincreasedassociationbetweentheactivatedTrkBandN-methyl-D-
aspartate receptor (NMDAR). In normal human subjects, 5days rTMS to

motor cortex decreased resting motor threshold, which correlates with
heightened BDNF-TrkB signaling and intensified TrkB-NMDAR association
inlymphocytes.ThesefindingssuggestthatrTMStocortexfacilitatesBDNF-
TrkB-NMDAR functioning in both cortex and lymphocytes.
The neuroprotective effect of high-frequency rTMS in a rat model of
transient cerebral ischemia was investigated using positron emission tomog-
raphy [13]. rTMS therapy was shown to increase glucose metabolism and
inhibit apoptosis in the ischemic hemisphere. The consequences of high-
frequency (25 Hz) transcranial magnetic stimulation on the expression of
glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the murine central nervous system
(CNS) were studied [14]. Trains of transcranial magnetic stimulation (1e30
trainsat25Hz,10sduration)weredeliveredtomicevia5-cmdiameterround
coils. The stimulation produced stimulus-locked motor responses but did not
elicitbehavioralseizures.GFAPmRNAlevelswereevaluated12,24,36,48h,
4 days, and 8 days following stimulation by in situ hybridization. Following
multiple 25Hz trains, there were dramatic increases in the levels of GFAP
mRNA in the hippocampal dentate gyrus; more modest increases were
observedinthecerebralcortex.TheselectiveincreasesinGFAPmRNAinthe
dentate gyrus were similar to those observed following single electroconvul-
siveseizures.Theseresultsindicatethattranscranialmagneticstimulationcan
be used to modulate astroglial gene expression, inducing the first stage of a
reactive response that is similar to what occurs following nervous system
injury.
Numerous works of such type unambiguously prove that magnetic TMS
signals stimulate and trigger gene expression; they are responsible for the
long-termmedicaleffects ofTMS.Promisingresultsinthetreatmentofadult

both prevention and correction of brain ischemic stroke-related metabolic
disorders such as ATP depletion and its consequences [16].
A new technique was developed to improve whole-brain signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR)at 7T,andanovel32-elementhybridhumanheadarraycoilwas
developed, constructed, and tested [17]. Firstly, loops and dipoles were
combined for the improvement of SNR near the head center. Secondly, the
totalnumberofarrayelementswasminimizedbyusingahybridcombination
of transceive (TxRx) and receive (Rx) elements. The developed array signif-
icantly improved SNR in vivo both near the center (w20%) and at the pe-
riphery (w20%e80%) in comparison to a common commercial array coil.

Chapter 9
Magneto-biology in medicine,
immunology, and microbiology
9.1 Are magneto-medical effects universal?
Every year more than 100 papers appear announcing magnetic effects in
biosystems, which are supposed to be important for medicine. An excellent
book [1] and recent reviews [2,3] summarize many observations, demon-
strating biomedical effects induced by magnetic fields. However, it is rather
delicate field; the question about the positive or negative influence of
magnetic and electromagnetic fields on living organisms seems to have no
certain answer, and the results are inconsistent and often contradictory; it
wasnoticedalsoinChapter6.Thereasonisthattheobservedeffectsdepend
on many factors besides magnetism [4]. For instance, it is known that the
well-beingofsomepeopledependsonmagneticstorms,butthecauseofthis
dependence seems to be the side effects (in particular, variations in atmo-
spheric pressure), rather than magnetic biochemistry. Further, we will
discuss the magneto-medical effects of ATP in vivo synthesis, in immu-
nology and microbiology.
9.2 Magneto-stimulated ATP in vivo synthesis
Enzymatic ATP synthesis by creatine kinase, phosphoglycerate kinase, and
pyruvate kinase irrefutably demonstrates the radical pair mechanism of this
reaction: kinases loaded with ions
25Mg2þ
,
43Ca2þ
, and
67Zn2þ
were almost
twice more efficient than kinases loaded with ions
24Mg2þ
,
40Ca2þ
, and
64Zn2þ
; the same nuclear induced magnetic catalysis is detected in isolated
mitochondria and in living organisms (rats, rabbits) [5]. The latter in vivo
effectwasusedtostimulateATPsynthesisinheartmuscletopreventhypoxia
and other pathologies related to the deficiency of ATP.
In contrast to uncontrollable nucleophilic ATP synthesis the radical pair
mechanism has a great advantage: it can be switched on artificially by
deliveringmagnesium

ATP synthesis invivo and prevent heart disorders related to the deficiency of
ATP, such as ischemia, heart muscle metabolic misbalance, drug and toxins

cardio tropic side effects, electrical trauma consequences, and inhalation
deplete hypoxia. For these purposes, the specific magnesium ion carrier
PMC16 (Fig. 7.2 in Chapter 7) has been designed [5e8].
It is a smart molecule: it carries four ions and releases them only in
response to the metabolic acidosis, that is, to the acidic pH shift, known as a
directandinevitableconsequenceofanysortofhypoxia,buttakesthemback
once the cell metabolism got recovered. This molecule was found to be suit-
able for the targeted delivery and accumulation of
Mg2þ
in nanoamounts
predominantly in the heart muscle, as myocardial cells have a high-affinity
protein receptor to porphyrin residue of PMC16 on the external membrane
of myocardiocyte mitochondria. Another attractive property of PMC16 as a
potential drug is its day-long retention in the heart tissue, particularly, inside
the heart mitochondria membranes.
TheabilitytostimulateATPsynthesisintheheartmuscleoflivingratswas
demonstrated by in vivo experiments [5e9]. Injection of doxorubicin was to

specific effect to be applied as an efficient remedy for the treatment of heart
diseases.
The [25Mg] PMC16 nanocontainer was tested in vivo in a variety of
mammals including mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, and goats [10e14]. It was
concluded that the stimulation of ATP synthesis by a magnetic isotope of
magnesium is a new phenomenon of fundamental biomedical importance; it
represents a breakthrough in the design of new remedies for the treatment of
hypoxia and some heart pathologies related to ATP deficiency. PMC16 is
shown to be a safe, easy-to-eliminate, and efficient medicinal agent with
prolonged pharmacological activity and with no sign of harmful metabolites
formed. Noteworthy, a pharmacological potential of
25Mg2þ
ions looks even
moreattractivebecausea high levelofATP is reached withoutincreasingthe
yield of the hazardous superoxides.
TheremarkablemagneticeffectwasannouncedbySaletniketal.[15].The
authorsinvestigatedtheeffectsoftheuseoflowmagneticfieldsasapotential
method for improving the quality of apples after storage. The fruits were
exposed to 100T magnetic fields for 8h per day and kept for a period of
2weeks in room conditions. The results showed that the samples that were
treatedwithamagneticfieldgenerallyhadahigherratiooftotalsolublesolid
andtitratableaciditycomparedtotheuntreatedsamples,whichindicatedtheir
higher quality. Continuous treatment with a magnetic field was shown to in-
fluence the mechanical properties of apples: greater firmness, lower weight
loss, and suppressed CO production of the apples that were stored at room
2
conditions.Itisconcludedthatthetreatmentwithamagneticfieldcanbeused
to extend the shelf life of apples. The biochemical reason for such an unex-
pected result seems to be the magnetic effect on the ATP synthesis.
9.3 Immunology in magnetic fields
Among the many factors that are able to cause immune-modulatory effects,
that is, toweaken orenhance the response of theimmunesystem, theauthors
of the review [16] focused their attention on the electromagnetic fields as a
possible external factor that may modulate immunity. They concluded that
now it is difficult to select physical or biological mechanisms or factors of
modulation of immune cells under electromagnetic field exposure. Neverthe-
less, the findings concerning modulation of gene expression induced by
electromagnetic fields cannot be excluded. The authors concluded that these
fieldsarepromisingtoolsforthemodulationofimmunecells;thisstatementis
in agreement with transcranial magnetic stimulation (Chapter 8).
The review [17] considers the effect of weak magnetic fields on the
functioningofthenervoussystem.Astheweakeningofthemagneticfieldisa

regulatory function in the formation of organism’s stress reaction, this study

9.4 Microbiology and reactive oxygen species
Numerous studies on the effects of magnetic fields on microorganisms were
exhaustively analyzed in the review [18]; the general conclusion is that
exposure to magnetic fields can enhance or reduce cell activity, that is, the
biological effects are not unambiguous and contrast each other. Significant
increases in fungal and bacterial growth of the soil microorganisms were
observed under low-frequency electromagnetic fields [19].
More certain conclusions were reached by Letuta et al. [20e22]. Micro-
organisms were found to be sensitive to the presence of nuclear magnetic
isotopic
25Mg2þ
ions with respect to nonmagnetic
24,26Mg2þ
isotopic ions.
Bacterialcells,grownon25Mgmediaandenrichedwiththisisotope,manifest
a highergrowth rate and colony-forming units compared with cells grown on
media containing nonmagnetic 24Mg and 26Mg isotopes. Magnetic field de-
pendencies of colony-forming cells enriched with different magnesium iso-
topeshavebeenalsodetected.Theobservedisotope-dependentdifferencesare
explained by intracellular enzymatic radical reactions, which are magnetic
field and nuclear spin sensitive. Enzymatic synthesis of ATP is considered as
the most probable magneto-sensitive biochemical process in vivo; it de-
termines the viability of cells and was shown in vitro (Chapter 5) to be a
nuclearspin-dependentreaction.Theinfluenceofmagneticfieldonmicrobial
activity was announced to be significant also in the papers [23,24].
The relation between magnetic fields and apoptosis was discussed by
Tofani [25]. The author emphasized that the potential therapeutic uses of
electromagneticfieldsincreasewithtime,particularlyofthose,whichconsider
potentialantitumoreffects.Magneticfieldeffectonapoptosisoftumorcellsis
one of the most important breakthroughs. The mechanism, underlying this
effect, considers the influence of the magnetic field on apoptosis through the
effect on electron spin that is able to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS)
concentration. Impacting the delicate balance between ROS production and
ROSeliminationintumorcellsisconsideredtobeapromisingcancertherapy,
affectingdifferentbiologicalprocesses,suchasapoptosisandmetastasis.The
effectofelectromagneticfieldsonthebiologicalproductionofreactiveoxygen
species is discussed also in Refs. [26,27]. Recently, magnetic field sensitivity
of endogenous auto-fluorescence in HeLa cells was investigated [28]. Under
used experimental conditions, the magnetic field effect was not observed; the
reason seems to be the contamination of the samples with paramagnetic Fe
ions, which is known to prevent the detection of the effect (Chapter 5).

Epilogue: Why magneto-biology
is attractive?
Present and future of magneto-biology
Sincetheappearanceofmagneto-biologyasanintriguingfieldofBigBiology,
themostsignificantevent,whichwashappenedinit,seemstobethediscovery
of huge isotope effects, when vitally important natural magnesium, calcium,
and zinc ions in the catalytic sites of enzymes were substituted and replaced
with nuclear magnetic ions

, and

of their stable iso-
topes. These effects have certified a new universal mechanism of enzymatic
reactions, which involves electron transfer between reagents, giving rise to
pairs of paramagnetic speciesdradical pairs. Such a pair with two unpaired
electrons produces two-spin system, in which there are two electron spin
states, singlet and triplet, with different spin multiplicity. Being chemically
completely identical, they are absolutely different in chemical reactivity. One
ofthemisallowedtoreact,theotheriscompletelyprohibited.Magneticfield
(of any nature) is the unique and the only factor capable to change spin of
radical pair and control its reactivity, removing spin forbiddance on the
reactions.
This discovery elucidated physical sense and the origin of numerous
magneto-biological effects; it has illuminated all magneto-biology and
introduced it as a respectable science. Now this spin concept and radical pair
mechanismaregenerallyacceptedandhighlyusedtointerpretandunderstand
experimentally detected magneto-biological effects. The majority ofthem are
discussed or referenced in this book.
Now, magneto-biology is an intensively developing science; it is invaded
now in neurophysiology, in the immune and circadian systems, in apoptosis
and genetics, in oncology, and microbiology. It is attractive, and its great
advantage is that it supplies noninvasive technologies. The modern magneto-
biology is developing in many directions, but the most important and
promising roads for medicine seem to be electromagnetic effects on brain
diseases and magnetic isotopes in oncology as a platform for anticancer
means.
