## Abstract

The coherent spin dynamics of radical pairs play a crucial role in their reactions,
which consequently cannot be described by a simple kinetic scheme. Instead,
simulations of the spin dynamics are required in order to predict the rate and
outcomeofradicalpairreactions,andespeciallytheirresponsetotheapplicationof
a magnetic field. Unfortunately, the number of spin states of the radical pair
increases exponentially with the number of nuclear spins, making deterministic
quantum mechanical simulations of realistic radical pairs difficult.
To overcome this difficulty, this thesis begins by presenting an efficient
stochasticquantummechanicalmethodcapableofdescribingaradicalpairwithas
many as 20 nuclear spins, which we use to analyse spin-dependent charge
recombination rates along molecular wires. This enables us to identify the mech-
anism of charge recombination of both the singlet and triplet states of the wire by
determining their relative contributions to the overall recombination rate.
