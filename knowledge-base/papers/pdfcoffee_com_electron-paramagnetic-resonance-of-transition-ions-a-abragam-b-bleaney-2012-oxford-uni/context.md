## Abstract

group that has the same multiplication table as
o+ is, by definition, the double cubic group 0+. The group 0+ is
obtained by adding to 0 the element R which is represented in o+ by
the matrix R commutes with all the other elements of 0+
and its square is equal to the unit element: R2 = E.
If A is an element of 0, every element of 0+ is either A or RA — AB.
This definition of the double group 0+ can clearly be extended to any
finite rotation group.
The irreducible representations F to F of 0 are also irreducible
x 5
representations of 0+. They are representations where R is represented
by the unit matrix, but there are others. To elucidate them we must
find the classes of 0+. One might think naively that as 0+ has twice as
many elements as 0 it has twice as many classes, those already listed
for O plus
Actually this is not so: C and RC belong to the same class and
2 2
similarly C' and RC%. This can be shown as follows (Opechowski 1940).
