  "abstract": "group that has the same multiplication table as\no+ is, by definition, the double cubic group 0+. The group 0+ is\nobtained by adding to 0 the element R which is represented in o+ by\nthe matrix R commutes with all the other elements of 0+\nand its square is equal to the unit element: R2 = E.\nIf A is an element of 0, every element of 0+ is either A or RA — AB.\nThis definition of the double group 0+ can clearly be extended to any\nfinite rotation group.\nThe irreducible representations F to F of 0 are also irreducible\nx 5\nrepresentations of 0+. They are representations where R is represented\nby the unit matrix, but there are others. To elucidate them we must\nfind the classes of 0+. One might think naively that as 0+ has twice as\nmany elements as 0 it has twice as many classes, those already listed\nfor O plus\nActually this is not so: C and RC belong to the same class and\n2 2\nsimilarly C' and RC%. This can be shown as follows (Opechowski 1940).\n2",
