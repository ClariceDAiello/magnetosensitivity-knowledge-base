## Abstract

The use of devices generating high magnetic fields in industrial
processes, energy production and storage, medical diagnostics, new
transport vehicles and large scale research facilities is expected to
expand significantly in the near future. Scientific and public interest
has focused recently on the biological effects and the potential health
risks associated with the exposure to magnetic fields. Over the last
twenty years several laboratory studies and epidemiological surveys
have been carried out in this field but no definite conclusions
concerning the related risks for personnel or general public have been
drawn. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of these
investigations together with an analysis of the well-established effects
of the interaction between static or ELF magnetic fields and living
matter. The international guidelines and standards for exposure to
magnetic fields are also reported and discussed.
